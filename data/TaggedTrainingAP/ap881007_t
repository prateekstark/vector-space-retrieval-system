<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday beat back a series of unrelated amendments to a catchall tax bill, including one designed to benefit 2 million owners of home satellite dishes. But consideration of such proposals delayed until next week final action on the tax bill, which includes a `` bill of rights'' for taxpayers involved in disputes with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and special relief worth $ 2.7 billion over three years for various groups, including farmers, artists and first-time homebuyers. By nightfall, an angry majority leader, Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, counted more than 100 proposed amendments still awaiting action and coaxed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> into cutting off any `` This list is crazy, nuts and getting crazier all the time,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` We ought to settle down and get our senses.'' Within two hours, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> announced senators had agreed to drop all but 29. Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> sided with <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, noting amendments dealing with everything but taxes, including sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, aid to the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> rebels and a move to halt commercial development of the historic <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> battlefield in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` This is the typical tax bill,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Everybody cleans out their desks and their trash cans and says ` we'll put it on the tax bill.' We've reached the point that if somebody does n't take the bull by the horns, we'll never finish.'' On the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> battlefield issue, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 50-25 to approve an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., requiring the federal government to seize 540 acres of land to prevent further development on the site about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> The House has approved the same provision, but the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary has said he will recommend that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto it. In siding with <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defeated a plan by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., to authorize the taking of only 80 acres and allow development of housing on adjacent areas The tax bill's main purpose is to correct errors in the big tax overhaul enacted in 1986. But since this is the only tax bill with a chance of becoming law this year, senators view it as the last opportunity to have their pet amendments considered. But there is no assurance it will become law. The version approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is considerably different and there is some doubt that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> can negotiate a compromise before quitting next week. In a long day of debate over the bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> considered and rejected amendments calling for: _ An end to what Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., called discrimination against owners of home satellite dishes by television His amendment was aimed at helping the 2 million dish owners, most of them living in rural areas, whose television and satellite dish have become prime sources of contact with the outside world. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s amendment would have required that programs provided to cable systems be made available to dish owners, and ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to extend network programming into isolated areas that can not receive broadcast signals. Opponents, led by Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, said the amendment was unnecessary, that `` there are no unfair trade practices in pricing and distribution of satellite programming.'' Managers of the bill said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s amendment had no chances of becoming law as part of the tax legislation. _ An 18-month study of whether government workers should get equal pay for jobs of comparable worth Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., proposed the study and was opposed vigorously by conservatives, who said it would lead to new federal requirements for what any worker could be paid <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> called the dissent `` blind opposition to knowledge.'' _ A symbolic endorsement of the right of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to finance abortions for poor women _ Raising from $ 17 a month to $ 38 the maximum tax-free mass-transit benefits that an employer could furnish workers Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, offered the amendment in the name of fairness, saying the government already provides a much higher subsidy for corporate executives to park their limousines. He would have paid for the change by doubling, to a maximum of $ 7,700, the tax imposed on gas-guzzling cars _ most of them luxury imports.

 <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> has done it again. No matter how much you steel yourself against the charm of the designer and his staff, or shut your eyes to the sumptuous surroundings of his dowtown <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> palazzo, and blot out the beauty of past collections _ it is to no avail. The clothes speak for themselves and confirm that <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> is the leader of the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> runway. `` Ravishing,'' exclaimed <PERSON> Kal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruttenstein </PERSON>, fashion director at <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, after Wednesday night's show which took the fashion crowd by surprise with evening wear that excelled the daytime clothes, usually the Armani forte. `` Breathtaking'' sighed <PERSON> Elin </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltzman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION>, as she kissed a satisfied Armani backstage. But a comment by <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> <PERSON> Samet </PERSON>, fashion editor of the French daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION>, was worth a thousand adjectives. `` Il est le seul.'' -LRB- He is the only one -RRB-, she pronounced, implying that only he in the school of Italian ready to wear could pose a threat to French fashion. Usually <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> is a step ahead of the pack, showing the direction fashion will take the following season. He was the first to present androgynous women and one of the earliest to send short skirts and lingerie tops down the runway. This season he preferred to flow with the tide, presenting a quiet, calm Spring-Summer 1989 collection, with delicate ethnic touches and a romantic maiden air, inspired by the avant-garde minimal designer <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gigli </PERSON>. It is the softness of the fabrics more than the cut of the clothes that give the collection its ethereal mood. Even <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>'s daytime suits with his new jacket rounded at the shoulder and hem and curved gently at the waist, worn over a long slim skirt, or wide pants, are stitched in such airy tweeds they could float down the runway all on their own The blouse, always a strong point at <LOCATION> Armani </LOCATION>, becomes so light that at times it looks like a chiffon scarf tied around the midrift. Fabrics are either checked or striped or printed in floral and geometric patterns. His evening wear is adorned in exquisite gold and silver embroidery and beading, reminiscent of Indian fabrics. To emphasize the softness of his collection, <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> takes the edge out of the hemline, leaving it unevenly stitched and un-ironed, as if it had been tucked up in a hurry. This do-it-yourself look spells grim days ahead for seamstresses and private maids. As the day goes on fabrics get lighter and sheerer. A series of cocktail suits were in Liberty and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> porcelain prints with matching stockings. Then came the negligee gowns, or elongated slips in simple navy satin, worn over a chiffon, fringed shawl. Embroidery started out slowly as piping on an otherwise simple gown or Tuxedo suit, to cover increasingly large areas of cloth until it became the entire dress. Thus a youthful strapless gown was made up entirely of chiffon flowers bunched together to look like an Old English porcelain bouquet, and long skirts, pants and even shorts with matching tops were lavished with gold and silver threading and beaded craftsmanship. The latter was a throw-back to the ornate Indian embroidery popular in the 1960's as confirmed by the Indian evening bags which completed the look. When they were not dazzling with jewels, his evening gowns were <PERSON> Ophelia </PERSON> - like in wispy chiffon, with a criss-cross bodice, and long skirt, with a dainty underskirt peering through Chiffon, in ombre pastel shades and creamy pinks was also used for pants and skirts alike to go with richly embroidered evening jackets. To make sure the look remained innocent, <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>, the perfectionist, showed the flatest heels of the week. More slippers than shoes, closed in the front, but strapped at the back, they usually were made out of fabric. <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> who tried the boudoir look several years ago, but did n't seem to like it, shied away from the bare-breasted nude look which has been the shock item on the runway this week _ except for a single black chiffon gown in which white embroidered piping served a double purpose: it concealed bare breasts, while at the same time it framed a bare midrift right down to the navel The Armani price tag for the Spring-Summer 1989 is not outrageous, just expensive. A jeweled jacket costs approximately $ 3,000 to $ 3,500 depending on how elaborate is the embroidery, while an entirely embroidered outfit can run as high as $ 7, OOO. The dilemma is do you buy a new car, or do you dress <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> and walk.

 A sightseeing plane with 46 aboard crashed into a hotel and exploded shortly after takeoff from a northern <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> city Friday, killing all but four on board, an official daily said Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said the four others on the Soviet-built Ilyushin Il-14 were injured, and some workers in the hotel also sustained injuries in the accident in <LOCATION> Linfen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province, about 400 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. It said the passengers on the piston-engine light transport plane were all employees of a local knitting factory. They had paid $ 4.30 each for a 15-minute air tour of the region. The daily said the plane went down one minute after takeoff, crashing into the roof of the Xinqiao Hotel. Four passengers managed to escape seconds before the plane exploded. The four crewmembers were all killed. The sightseeing service, operated by a local air company, had just begun on Oct. 1, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s National Day. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shichang </PERSON>, director of the knitting factory and one of the four on board who escaped, said his group had seen a television report on the sightseeing flight and decided to take it `` as we have earned a lot of money recently. We never imagined we would have this disaster.'' It was the second major plane accident of the year in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, following the crash of a Soviet-designed Ilyushin Il-18 four-engine turboprop operated by the national airways <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION> in January that killed 108 near the southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> city of Chungking. In August another <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION> jetliner skidded off the runway at <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> airport and plunged into the harbor, killing six crew members and one passenger.

 It's been 31 years since `` Dem Bums'' became beach bums, since <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Malley </PERSON> moved the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The wounds have yet to heal. Today, the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> return _ to <LOCATION> Shea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> Ebbets </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> _ to play the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> for the National League pennant. But to many Brooklynites, this homecoming to the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> will be happy only if the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> go down in defeat. `` The old <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> were a very special team, in a very special time, in a very special place. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> are not really the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Brooklynite </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Macrillo </PERSON>. `` They do n't look like the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION>, they do n't sound like the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION>,'' she continued. `` It's very easy to root for the <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Macrillo </PERSON>'s cheers are echoed by the many <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> fans who swore off the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 23, 1957, when <PERSON> O'Malley </PERSON> moved the team of <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, Pee Wee <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Snider </PERSON> closer to <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> than <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.

I feel no compunction to root for the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fame </ORGANIZATION>. `` When they left us, I was angry. ... When they left, they took the soul. The soul left <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Ebbets </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, home of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s beloved Bums, was razed in 1960. As far as many younger fans know, the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> have always played in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Chavez Ravine. `` I think a lot of this is passe now and over with,'' said <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knicks </ORGANIZATION> public relations man <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Agostino </PERSON>, a die-hard <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> fan who wrote a book about the team's history. `` I do n't read as much into this as other people do. `` If you were 15 when the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> left, you're 46 now. What do you remember about the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION>? They've been gone 31 years. The <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> have been playing for 26 years.'' Try telling that to <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON>, who welcomed the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> to the playoffs with a vitriolic column in which <PERSON> O'Malley </PERSON>'s name was preceded each time with an epithet. `` Some wounds never heal,'' wrote <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON>, who broke a three-decade boycott of <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> home games this week to root for the <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- who, by the way, have eight native Californians on the roster -RRB-. `` I go to the enemy camp'' _ <LOCATION> Dodgers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, that is _ `` as a hostile witness,'' he wrote. `` And the vow still holds.

 A tiger escaped from its cage, attacked a boy and triggered a panic that left 40 people unconscious during a circus in rural china, a newspaper reported today. The Workers Daily reported that the tiger broke out of its cage after being hit by its trainer for failing to carry out a trick during a show in northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province last month. It said 40 people were knocked unconscious when hundreds of spectators surged toward the exit. One primary school student was attacked by the tiger and required 48 stitches in his face. The daily did not say how the tiger was subdued and returned to its cage. It said a similar accident involving the same circus troupe had occurred the previous month and called for improved safety measures.

 Three pesticide-laden helicopters took off on an aerial spraying mission Thursday night to fight the Medfly infestation that has set up a base in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and the city's toney <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> `` They're currently over <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> controller at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> where the choppers departed from shortly after 8 p.m. The spraying program is the first step in an all-out attack against the Mediterranean fruit fly, a pest that destroys about 250 varieties of produce. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> again forecast coastal fog for the area Thursday night, but officials moved the starting time up 2 -LCB- hours to 8 p.m. hoping to beat the rolling fog bank. The spraying was ordered because 47 Medflies were found in yards since Sept. 26, a serious infestation that if allowed to spread would threaten fruits and vegetables that are a major part of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s $ 15.5 billion-a-year farm economy. The Thursday flight was set for a 35-square-mile area of 100,000 residents that includes middle-class stucco homes, mansions, swank Rodeo Drive shops and luxury car dealerships, all subject to the honey-like stickiness of the Malathion spray. Along with parts of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, officials are spraying sections of western <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the adjacent cities of <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. At <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON> on the corner of <LOCATION> Olympic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bundy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a caravan of about 100 shiny Caddies left the sales lot Wednesday night for an underground parking lot at a bank building six blocks away, sales manager <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Thursday. He said several of the cars were returned to the sales lot Thursday morning for potential tire-kickers, with the luxury car exodus to be repeated at nightfall. The pesticide poses no health risks, health officials say, but the sticky corn syrup bait mixed with the Malathion could mess up a car's paint job. Museums in the area covered their outdoor statues. Agricultural Commissioner <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaugy </PERSON> said the fight to save the state's farm industry knows no economic boundaries. `` We're encouraging people to cover up their Rolls Royces just like they would cover up their Pintos,'' he said on Wednesday

 <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> once said there were three types of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics. Republicans and Democrats are arguing about all three in the aftermath of the <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle-Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> debate. Each side accused the other vice presidential hopeful of playing fast and loose with the facts in Wednesday night's encounter. A Republican truth squad put out a six-page analysis of `` Bentsen Distortions and Errors'' on Thursday, while Democrats confined themselves to five pages on `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s Factual Mistakes.'' In less polite parlance, that means lies on such subjects as Social Security, poverty and just how well <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> knows European leaders. Here is a look at some of the points in dispute:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>POVERTY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` Poverty has n't gone up in this administration. It has n't gone down much either.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says that in 1980, 13 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population, or 29.3 million people, were living in poverty. The rate rose to 14 percent, or 31.8 million people, in 1981, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first year in office, peaked at 15.2 percent or 35.3 million in 1983, then gradually dropped back to 13.5 percent, or 32.5 million, in 1987, the latest year available. Measured since 1980, the poverty rate is up by one-half percentage point; measured since 1981, it is down by that much. In either case the actual number of poor people is up, since the population has grown.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOCIAL SECURITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` voted eight times to cut the benefits on Social Security,'' the Republican fired back, `` You know that I did not vote to cut Social Security benefits eight times. What I have voted for and what Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has voted for is to delay the cost-of-living adjustments.'' He said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, too, had twice voted for freezes, and that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took a similar position at a governors' conference. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman, did not dispute those votes, but said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` does n't understand that freezing or delaying the <ORGANIZATION> COLA </ORGANIZATION> cuts benefits. ... The bottom line is smaller checks.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PACS and HONORARIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, asked about being the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest recipient of political action committee money _ $ 1.5 million for his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> re-election campaign, said, `` I do n't find it embarrassing at all.'' He said his $ 10,000-a-place `` breakfast club'' for lobbyists was `` a real doozy'' of a mistake, but `` perfectly legal, and you have all kinds of such clubs on the Hill.'' But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s $ 10,000-a-seat club was considered unusual, although other congressional leaders do arrange regular briefings and entrees for favored donors. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who accepts no speaking fees, charged that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has `` collected over a quarter of a million dollars of honorariums now, speaking to various interest groups.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s camp said he donated almost $ 20,000 of his honoraria to charity in 1986 and $ 14,302 in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules prohibit senators from keeping speech fees above 30 percent of their salary.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ENVIRONMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> apparently mixed up his CFCs and CO2 when he praised <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to grapple with the ozone problem. `` For the first time, we are talking about the impact of C02 to the ozone layer,'' he said. But CO2 _ carbon dioxide _ does not deplete the ozone layer; chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, do. Carbon dioxide does add to the global warming phenomenon known as the `` greenhouse effect'' _ another environmental problem.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BOSTON HARBOR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 After <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did `` virtually nothing'' to clean up <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, `` the dirtiest waterway in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> charged that a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto of a clean water bill had `` made it impossible to move ahead at that time on <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dragged his feet on the cleanup back in 1978, the final year of his first term as governor, when he prepared an application to the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> seeking a waiver from the 1972 Clean Water Act requiring secondary treatment of sewage being pumped into the harbor. His successor completed the application in 1979. By the time the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> rejected it in May 1983, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was governor again. Under court pressure, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the state legislature created a public authority to undertake the $ 6 billion cleanup _ without the 75 percent federal funding available in the 1970s.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FOREIGN AFFAIRS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` I've been to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> many times to meet with our negotiators as we are hammering out the INF treaty. I've met with the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> political leaders _ <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, Chancellor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. I know them. They know me.'' According to a visitor's log kept by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made only one visit to the Swiss city during the nearly four years the <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate-Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> treaty was under negotiation. That was in February 1987. He also visited <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last Feb. 7-8 and met again with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control negotiators, but that was two months after the treaty was signed. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spokesman, said he believed the senator met <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> when the West German chancellor stopped by a dinner <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff at a conference of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> a year or so ago. <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> said he knew of at least one meeting with Thatcher: Last July when the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister attended a dinner with senators on a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Elevating the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to full Cabinet status will involve only changing a few signs outside the building, proponents said after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelming support of the change. Rep. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., said the cost of the change approved Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will come to less than $ 1 million in 1989 and will give the nation's 27 million veterans direct access to the White House The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that converting the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> into a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> department would cost $ 33 million over five years. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote sent the compromise bill, making the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> the government's 14th Cabinet department, to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which was expected to add its approval. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> backs the move, and it was his public announcement of support last summer that gave impetus to the legislation. House approval came on a voice vote, overriding objections from opponents who called the move an act of election-year pandering that will result in increased future costs for veterans programs. `` This is an act of great hypocrisy,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., who said he had heard numerous colleagues complain privately that the legislation should not be adopted `` Why does <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> do things like that? We do it because of special interests,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. `` Members are in craven fear of retribution at the polls. I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are looking to have people of courage to govern them. You ca n't serve every special interest in our country without ever adding up the bottom line.'' The new <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which would go into effect in March, would represent the fifth new Cabinet department since 1960. Opponents pointed out the irony of it receiving support from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who began his presidency promising to eliminate two Cabinet departments _ Education and Energy _ an idea he later abandoned. The Veterans Administration, according to supporters of the legislation, already has the fifth-largest budget among federal agencies and merits being put on par with other Cabinet departments to ensure that the money is properly administered `` This says to the millions of men and women who've worn the uniform of our armed forces that we care,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N </LOCATION>. He said placing a veterans' advocate at the table with the president and other Cabinet members will give greater voice to their needs. A primary sponsor of the measure, Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, noted that the <LOCATION> VA </LOCATION> hospital system is suffering from a $ 600 million budget shortfall and that Cabinet status would help it make the case for full financing. `` This will go a long way toward guaranteeing that the veterans of the future are going to be taken care of,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. According to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors with a budget of $ 30 billion. It will dispense $ 14 billion in income maintenance and $ 626 million for education and rehabilitation assistance this year. The agency and its 240,000 employees administered 90,000 patient beds in 534 health facilities and will see 20 million outpatients this year. It runs 109 national cemeteries and will bury 300,000 veterans this year.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill To Track Medical Waste From Start to Finish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is moving to slap controls on medical waste, from the vials of AIDS-infected blood washing up on <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> beaches to the used hypodermic needles picked out of trash bins by children in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The vehicle to attack the growing problem of carelessly discarded medical waste is a bill that would require a so-far reluctant <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to set up a system to track the waste from creation to disposal. The legislation, given impetus by this summer's publicized cases of infectious materials littering ocean and Great Lakes shorelines, was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday by a 390-28 margin. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has approved a more limited control blueprint. Lawmakers in both chambers say they see no difficulty working out a joint product that can be sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns next week. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, says action is needed because `` the illegal disposal of medical waste is spreading like an epidemic across the country. This waste is not just repulsive, it can literally kill people. `` According to recent federal studies, as many as 18,000 people each year may contract hepatitis B from accidental contact with medical waste,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` Hundreds of those infected will ultimately die from the infection.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan would cover waste produced by hospitals, clinics and labs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> states of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The program, however, could become national in scope because any other state could decide to have its waste covered by the plan and gain authority to act against incoming waste not meeting the tracking system's requirements. `` This is a national problem,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore. `` The medical waste system in this country is broken It is overloaded, and in effect it is starting to regurgitate what it can not keep down.'' Expected to form the basis for the final bill, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan would apply to 10 types of medical waste, including blood, hypodermic needles, scalpels and surgical and laboratory waste that has been in contact with infectious agents. The enumerated items would have to be segregated from other medical waste. The tracking system would have to contain assurances that a generator knows the waste reached a disposal facility. The legislation does not, however, set any standards for actual disposal, such as burning or using a hazardous waste landfill. Supporters said there was no time this year to work out these details. They add, however, that it already is illegal to dump such waste into waterways. Violators of the tracking requirements could be slapped with a civil fine of up to $ 25,000 for each day of violation and a maximum criminal penalty of two years in prison and a fine of up to $ 50,000 per day of violation. <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said the medical waste problem goes beyond the beach foulings that closed stretches of oceanfront in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> the past two summers. `` Last year, careless doctors in <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> -RRB- and <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> put contaminated needles and vials of infected blood into dumpsters,'' he said. `` Kids found the needles and blood vials and played ` doctor' with them _ splattering blood on each other and giving each other injections that could have proved fatal.'' House members said they believe <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> already has the authority to act against medical trash under various hazardous waste control laws. In 1978, the agency announced plans to regulate medical waste, but six years later it said lacked evidence those wastes were causing enough harm to justify regulations. Instead, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> released a package of advice to hospitals on handling and disposal. Since then, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has formed a task force to rethink the issue. `` EPA has dragged its feet on this matter,'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said. `` EPA told us that as of this summer, they had budgeted exactly one staff position to deal with the medical waste issue. That is why we need this legislation.''

 A new recipe has been developed for fortifying mother's milk to help premature babies `` barely bigger than a man's hand'' survive and grow normally, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said `` The immune properties found in mother's milk are so much more important to preterm infants because they are subject to many more infections than full-term infants,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schanler </PERSON>, physician in charge of the project at the Children's <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. But extremely premature babies, some of them weighing less than two pounds at birth, require more concentrated nutrients than mother's milk provides, he said. Most currently get a preemie formula based on cow's milk until they reach about three pounds and are growing well. After that, some may be switched to mother's milk mixed with a commercial fortifier. Concern about the practice of feeding the formulas to the tiny infants during their first month of life prompted <PERSON> Schanler </PERSON> and a former colleague, Dr. <PERSON> Cutberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, now at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, to look into ways of using breast milk from birth. Their research at the center, which is based at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and is funded by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, included tests of commercial formulas and new recipe possibilities. The work was described in a report issued Thursday by the agency. <PERSON> Schanler </PERSON> said the new recipe includes mineral salts that are readily absorbed by the infants, and protein and energy from powdered skim mother's milk supplied by the center's own human milk bank. Although the recipe is being used for research purposes, <PERSON> Schanler </PERSON> said he doubts whether it will be feasible to produce a commercial fortifier made from human milk, noting that there are n't many human milk banks for this purpose But he said the findings from the recipe research should lead to better fortifiers so that very low-birth-weight infants can have the infection fighting factors present in breast milk when they most need it right after birth. The milk would still have to be taken from the mother with a breast pump, fortified with the forumla and fed to the baby through a tube. The initial concern has been to get enough protein and energy into the tiny babies, and `` we did n't pay much attention to minerals,'' <PERSON> Schanler </PERSON> said. Calcium and phosphorous were the main problem, a lack of which could `` compromise growth, impair healing of chronic lung disease and lead to bone malformations,'' <PERSON> Schanler </PERSON> said. The scientists came close to matching the `` in-the-womb retention levels'' of these minerals by adding calcium lactate and sodium or potassium phosphate to mother's milk. Infants averaging only 2.2 pounds at birth retained 86 percent of the calcium and 80 percent of the phosphorous they would have retained if still in their mother's uterus and are `` the best rates we have seen,'' <PERSON> Schanler </PERSON> said. According to <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, who now directs nutritional sciences at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>, the government's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> requires formula companies to add a minimum amount of calcium without sufficient regard to its form. `` That's not enough for these tiny infants,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. `` You need to look at the form as well as the amount.'' For example, <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said, the calcium salt added to commercial formulas is tribasic calcium phosphate, which is not very soluble. `` It's like rock,'' he said. `` Most of it probably does n't get absorbed -LRB- into the infant's system -RRB- but comes out in the stool. Calcium lactate is much better utilized.'' Although the scientists recognize that human milk has less calcium and phosphorous than both regular and preemie formulas, they say the minerals are in a form more easily absorbed by the infants. Also human milk may have unknown factors that enhance infants' absorption and retention. Formula companies have not been able to duplicate these conditions in commercial preparations and compensate by increasing the concentration of minerals, the report said. Another former colleague, Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a physician now at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said the higher concentrations of minerals in commercial formulas may benefit the very low-birth-weight infants after they leave the hospital. After discharge, the mothers either chose to continue on unfortified breast milk or switch to regular infant formula. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who tracked the infants for a year, found that the breast-fed babies had a lower bone mineral content than those who got commerical formulas. But they grew equally well on either, he said. Body weight, length and head measurements were the same for both groups. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> recommended that pediatricians regularly evaluate the mineral status of nursing preemies, but he added that `` the risks do not outweigh the benefits of breast feeding.''

<HEAD>Psychologists Say Military Needs To Better Understand Stress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Psychologists who studied the downing of an Iranian civilian airliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> say the military needs to better understand stress and should spend more on psychological research and improve its crew training. The judgment of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser crew that mistakenly shot down the Iranian plane July 3 was clouded by misconceptions caused by stress, the psychologists said. `` There is much knowledge about how decisions go wrong and how they can be improved that is not being put to use in military decision-making,'' Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Slovic </PERSON>, a psychology professor from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Thursday. Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Zornetzer </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s office of naval research, responded that the service does try to consider stress and is spending $ 12 million a year on basic research into psychological questions. Another $ 18 million is being spent to apply the results of that research to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> programs. While progess is being made, he said, `` it must be clearly recognized that these research problems are among the most difficult and complex in the entire research spectrum.'' The hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> policy subcommittee was part of the panel's examination of the destruction of <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Flight 655 that killed all 290 people on board. It was shot down by the cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> in the mistaken belief that the commercial jetliner was a military plane diving toward the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation attributed the incident to stress-related mistakes made by the crew of the Aegis-class cruiser, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s most sophisticated warships. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said crew members, under battle-caused stress after just finishing a firefight with Iranian gunboats, misread or misinterpreted a variety of electronic data from the Aegis computers. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the panel, said, `` Misinterpretations of data provided by the Aegis weapon system and chaotic communications in the command center have pointed up troubles with man's ability to make fast, accurate decisions in combat. Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbett </PERSON>, a psychology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, noted that the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> crew was on alert for an attack by Iranian planes. The crew members interpreted the data to see what they expected to see, he said. `` Expectations can color what people think they see, and what they remember, to a far greater degree than is recognized by common sense,'' <PERSON> Nisbett </PERSON> said. `` Magicians and card sharks have long made a living on this principle, and in the last 30 years or so psychologists have learned a great deal about the scope of the principle in daily life events,'' he said. <PERSON> Nisbett </PERSON> also noted the example of the USS Stark, which was hit by an Iraqi missile in May 1987, killing 37 seamen. Top officers on the Stark were disciplined for not firing their weapons against the Iraqi plane, and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships in the region were on a high state of alert after that. The Vincennes crew wanted to avoid another incident like that involving the Stark, <PERSON> Nisbett </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmreich </PERSON>, a psychology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> crew members did n't communicate among themselves well enough. `` The communications problems evident in the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> incident closely parallel those uncovered in analyses of the causes of crashes in civilian and military air transport,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pew </PERSON> said another risk arises from the highly automated, computerized nature of modern warships like the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. `` Research is badly needed to understand when and just how much automation to introduce in situations where the ultimate control and responsibility must rest with the human operators,'' he said.

 A man claiming he had been the subject of government mind control experiments disrupted an appearance by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising dinner Friday night. The man made a long and rambling argument that he had been mistreated, while guests at the $ 1,000-a-plate event attempted to drown him out with applause. The disruption occurred just after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> concluded his address to the crowd. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, standing just behind the lectern he'd used for his speech, seemed puzzled as he strained to hear the man. Secret Service agents on the scene made no attempt to approach the man, who identified himself as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, 58, of <PERSON> Inkster </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. But after several moments of yelling toward <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who was approximately 150 feet away on the podium, the president interrupted him. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went to the microphone and said that he was having difficulty hearing the man, although he said the protester seemed to `` feel strongly'' about what he was saying. But the president, showing increasing impatience and anger, shouted that `` I do n't think it's fair to subject the people to all of this. Why do n't you write it in a letter and send it to me.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had arrested the same man in 1985 when he tried to deliver papers about mind control to former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> during a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> appearance. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked later if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had felt endangered by the intruder, said, `` No, not at all.'' `` He just said, ` Who was that man and what did he want anyway?''' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, paraphrasing the president. Secret Service Special Agent <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> said late Friday that <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> was interviewed and released. No charges were filed. `` He was interviewed. He made no threats against the president. He meant no harm to him. That's the main thing the Secret Service was interested in,'' <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> said. Few incidents of this sort have plagued <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in recent years as security surrounding him was tightened substantially following his shooting on March 30, 1981 by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> remains confined to a mental hospital in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> After <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the man to be quiet, the concluding part of the president's portion of the program proceeded and he left without incident. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> did not say how he had gotten into the event, nor whether he had paid the $ 1,000 fee. But pressed on that, he said, `` I just walked in.'' The man stood apart from the dinner tables in an area not far from the president occupied by a pool of reporters admitted to cover <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech. It was apparent that <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents determined the man was not presenting any physical threat to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and therefore no attempt was made to rush him. `` I was quiet and let him speak. I was quiet and stood here,'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> told reporters. During his tirade, <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> had asked, `` Why do n't you take the mind control machine off of me, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>?'' `` Why do n't you use it on the communists that's here in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and why do n't you get rid of communism in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?'' he said. Several boos emanated from the well-heeled crowd of Republican donors, many of whom were heard shouting, `` Get out and shut up!'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> was arrested on April 24, 1985, when he tried to deliver to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> a three-page typewritten document saying he was the victim of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government mind-control device. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, who listed an <LOCATION> Inkster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, address on the document, said the device injured his eyesight and muscles and his ability to learn and to have sex. Two Secret Service agents knelt beside both sides of his chair after <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> completed his speech. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> resisted the agents and was taken to the rear of the room with his arm behind his back. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> told reporters Friday night that he was treated for three weeks at a state psychiatric hospital in <LOCATION> Northville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, following the Carter incident. He produced a photocopy of what appeared to be a report from a <ORGANIZATION> Northville </ORGANIZATION> staffer, who said <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> `` rambled'' about the mind-control device. A woman who answered the telephone Friday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Northville </ORGANIZATION> hospital said state law prevented her from giving any information about current or former patients. She hung up without giving her name. There were two McKnights listed in the Inkster telephone directory. <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> Belle </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said neither she nor her daughter were related to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Business Leaders See Strong Growth, Then Slowdown To Stem
Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's top business leaders today offered an optimistic view of economic prospects, predicting growth will slow enough next year to avoid a severe acceleration of inflation. The Business Council, composed of 62 chief executives of the country's largest corporations, predicted that the economy, as measured by the gross national product, will grow 4 percent in 1988, the best in four years. `` We are living in a continued strong economy,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest bank. `` We are very close to full employment, and the inflation numbers ... are generally felt to be in pretty good shape.'' The new GNP prediction, reflecting the consensus of the chief economists of about 20 member corporations, is 1.6 percentage points better than the prediction last May when the executives last gathered for their semiannual retreat at this resort town in the mountains of western <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Some economists in the spring still were worried about lingering aftershocks from the stock market crash of October 1987. Growth proved to be stronger than nearly anyone anticipated, and now the concern is that it is too vigorous and likely to fuel inflation. But the Business Council's economists are projecting GNP growth of 2.5 percent next year and less than 2 percent in 1990, in line with what the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> considers necessary for a `` soft landing'' of the economy to a sustainable, non-inflationary expansion. The economists were expecting more inflation, an increase from a 4.2 percent rate this year to 5.1 percent next year, but `` no one expected a return to the high inflation rates of the late 1970s and early 1980s,'' their report said. They also foresaw a modest rise in interest rates next year followed by some easing in 1990. The rate on 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, which tend to run about 1.5 percentage points below fixed-rate mortgages, should increase from an average of 9.1 percent this year, peak at 10.2 percent over the next 18 months and average 9.5 percent in 1990, the council said. The business executives were troubled, however, about the prospects for reducing the federal budget deficit to meet the targets of the Gramm-Rudman law and for shrinking the trade deficit without a further decline in the value of the dollar. `` The business community generally remains very concerned about the twin deficits and of what we are afraid and convinced will be the undesirable price we'll pay for it if we do n't solve it,'' said <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the health care company. The economic panel saw only negligible improvement through 1990 from the current budget gap of about $ 150 billion. The Gramm-Rudman law, however, calls for a deficit of $ 136 billion in 1989 and $ 100 billion in 1990. The trade deficit is expected to shrink from $ 170 billion in 1987 to $ 134 billion this year and to below $ 100 billion by 1990. But the business executives said the dollar, which fell steadily through 1986 and 1987 before beginning to rebound this year, will have to start falling again. A cheaper dollar makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more affordable on overseas markets. The economic panel predicted the dollar would be worth 120 Japanese yen and 1.68 German marks, down from 134 yen and 1.88 marks currently. `` I think it's unfortunate that the dollar firmed from the first of the year. I think we were closer to the right range earlier in the year than we are today,'' said <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The economic forecast was issued at the beginning of a two-day conference at which the executives will hear from speakers including <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>; Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, co-chairmen of a blue ribbon commission studying the budget deficit; and Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairmen of the congressional budget

 The Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is eagerly lending its support to a plan, already endorsed by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, that would help lower - and middle-income families use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds to finance higher education The proposal would provide a tax exclusion for interest earned on a bond that is redeemed to pay for college or vocational education. Its sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the plan is simple and risk-free, giving `` children security in their future without creating a new bureaucracy or spending program. Even though it was recommended by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in his budget, endorsed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his presidential campaign and passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday on a 94-0 vote, there is no assurance it will become law. That is because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> attached it to a catchall bill whose main purpose is to correct mistakes and clear up ambiguities in the far-reaching tax overhaul package enacted in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill also includes a variety of special tax cuts costing about $ 2.7 billion over three years, plus the tax increases to pay for them. By comparison, the version approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has about $ 7.5 billion worth of tax cuts and increases. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes several parts of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders are reluctant to give in to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on some of those provisions. With <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> pressing to adjourn next week for the year, it may be difficult for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators to agree on a compromise. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders hoped to wrap up work on the bill today. Senators spent most of Thursday debating an amendment that would have raised taxes on cigarettes, liquor, wine and beer to pay for part of a big anti-drug bill. The tax increase is likely to be considered again next week when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> considers the drug legislation. The amendment, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, was defeated on a 60-33 vote. A substitute by Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, that would have cut a handful of spending programs, including legal-services aid and low-income energy assistance, to fight drug abuse, failed 72-22. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wasted little time approving <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s amendment to help families pay for education The provision is not in the House-passed tax bill. Under the proposal, which <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> first introduced a year ago, a family could avoid paying taxes on the interest earned on bonds that are redeemed to pay for college or vocational schooling. The full exclusion would be available to families with incomes under $ 60,000 and would be reduced gradually as income rises, disappearing for those whose earnings reach $ 80,000. Present law allows the owner of a savings bond to avoid taxation on the interest earned until the bond is redeemed; the interest is exempt from state and local taxes. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s plan would simply turn the deferral into an exclusion if the bond is used for education. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential candidate, has proposed a different method of helping finance higher education. He would create a program under which students could borrow their tuition and repay it through payroll deductions after they graduate. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said his exclusion would not increase the federal budget deficit. Included in his amendment is a provision offsetting the costs of the benefit by eliminating in most cases the personal exemption now claimed by parents for a dependent who is 24 or older and a full-time student. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill to which <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s proposal was attached has dozens of special tax benefits for farmers and other off-road users of diesel fuel, first-time homebuyers, corporate research efforts and workers who receive educational or legal assistance from employers. The measure includes a `` bill of rights'' for taxpayers involved in disputes with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Not voting on the savings bond interest exemption were Sens. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, R-Neb.; <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, R-S.; and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>20th Century Fox Charged With Contempt In `Block Booking' Movies</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Twentieth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been charged with contempt of court for allegedly forcing some theaters to book unpopular movies in exchange for the right to show popular films. An indictment returned Thursday by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> accuses the company and an employee of violating the terms of a 1951 antitrust order in booking movies, including the blockbuster `` Aliens,'' from 1984 to 1987. The alleged `` block bookings'' were made by <PERSON> Leila </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, who managed <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s Indianapolis-Milwaukee branch office, the grand jury said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a subsidiary of <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, denied wrongdoing. The action was brought under a consent decree settling a 1930s-era antitrust battle in which the government broke the big movie studios' control of the nation's theaters. Among the practices barred by the consent decree is block booking, or requiring a theater to agree to show one or more movies, often unpopular films, in exchange for the right to show a successful movie. The grand jury accused <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> of violating a provision against block booking in a 1951 consent decree the company signed that stemmed from the antitrust case, according to an announcement by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> that was released in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The indictment alleged that <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> improperly entered into distribution agreements with theater companies for several hit movies. The announcement did not name the theater companies involved. The indictment alleged that from January to July 1985, exhibition of `` The Flamingo Kid'' was conditioned upon theaters also taking the less popular `` Johnny Dangerously''; from July 1984 to January 1985, `` Cocoon'' was `` block booked'' with `` Prizzi's Honor''; from July 1985 to January 1986, `` Aliens'' was paired with `` Space Camp'' and `` Big Trouble in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>''; and from March 1987 to June 1987, `` Mannequin'' was booked with `` Black Widow. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said it has a program to ensure compliance with the consent decree that includes employee education. `` Even the alleged offending conduct is, as the charge itself demonstrates, confined to only a portion of a single Fox branch involving a limited number of films,'' the company said in a news release.

<HEAD>Congresswomen Push for Medicare Payments for Mammography
Screenings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two congresswomen say they will push for legislation next year to allow full Medicare coverage for elderly women seeking mammography screenings, the X-ray technique used to detect early signs of breast cancer. `` We need to promote preventive medicine, not just pay for care once an illness has set in,'' Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. Mrs. <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON> said the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, enacted into law earlier this year, included a $ 50 reimbursement provision for the mammograms. `` A $ 50 mammogram is not readily available in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the congresswoman said. `` The average cost for a mammogram ranges from $ 80 to $ 200.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON> said the only place a woman can receive a mammogram for $ 50 is mobile van clinics. `` Most women, especially older women, simply will not submit to being examined by a stranger in a van in the parking lot of a shopping mall,'' she said. `` Not only is a woman more likely to undergo the test when under the care of someone she knows and with whom she is comfortable, but doctors are more able to identify changes over time, and are able to provide the analysis, counseling and follow-up that are necessary to effectively care for patients,'' she said. A bill introduced by Mrs. <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON> would remove the $ 50 cap, making Medicare coverage for mammogram screenings the same as for mammograms for women already diagnosed with breast cancer. The Office of Technology Assessment has estimated that screening women over 65 could reduce the breast cancer mortality rate by 50 percent after five years, according to Mrs. <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON>. `` Breast cancer took the lives of 45,000 women in 1987, of which 28,000 were over age 65. Many of those lives could have been saved if mammograms were readily available and affordable to those women,'' she told a Capitol news conference. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> recommends that women over 40 undergo mammography screenings annually.

 Editors of the Guinness Book of Records are debating whether to list Canadian sprinter <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> as the world-record holder for his 9.79-second 100-meter run at the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 26, was stripped of the gold medal he won in the race Oct. 24 after testing positive for performance-enhancing anabolic steroids, banned by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The committee erased his time from the books. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amateur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> banned <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> from competition for two years, while the Olympic committee awarded the first-place prize to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rival, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who had finished second with a time of 9.92 seconds. `` It would be ridiculous to say he -LRB- <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> -RRB- did n't run the 100 meters in 9.79, because he clearly did,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Newport </PERSON>, deputy sports editor of the Guinness records book, said Thursday.

We have to consider him for inclusion, although it has put us in a difficult position because of the drugs.''

<HEAD>Tobacco Export Program Comes in for Capitol Hill Heat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Farm lawmakers are turning political heat on <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials over a tobacco export program marked by abuses that have become the focus of a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation. `` I think this is the worst disaster for an agriculture program that I have seen in my eight years in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, said Thursday at a hearing of his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tobacco and peanuts subcommittee. At the heart of the controversy is a program providing exporters with credit guarantees assuring they will get their money for American agricultural products they send overseas even if the foreign buyers fail to pay. More than $ 30 million in such guarantees have been provided for tobacco shipments alone this year by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. But farm lawmakers are upset by an array of abuses and other problems besetting the program. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is investigating allegations that 14 companies obtained guarantees for exports by saying their shipments consisted entirely of American tobacco when they actually were a foreign and domestic blend. Lawmakers are irked by a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> policy that provides guarantees for exports of blended foreign and domestic tobacco, although only for the American portion. They say the program is supposed to help farmers by spurring exports and thus should be limited to 100 percent American shipments. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also stands accused by lawmakers and congressional investigators of not finding fraud even when the service was warned specifically about it two years ago. And <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> on Thursday clashed with service Administrator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, saying his claim that guarantees always were provided for the American portion of blended shipments was the opposite of what he told the panel four months ago and at variance with investigative findings. The question is a sore point with tobacco-state lawmakers who contend that a policy revision from <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> last month opens the door to credit guarantees for blended shipments for the first time. `` This is a coverup, Mr. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. `` I resent that,'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> replied. `` I do n't care if you resent it or not,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. `` You were covering up a fraudulent practice in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.'' Initial reports of blended shipments covered by guarantees emerged from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in 1986, bringing congressional demands for an investigation. At the time, the service dismissed the concern as unfounded. Followup by the inspector general, however, determined that tobacco exports consisting of blended foreign and domestic products had been covered by guarantees as if they were 100 percent American. `` It makes my blood boil,'' Rep. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, said. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said he was `` infuriated'' by the disclosures, but added that he had seen no reason to question the assurances of exporters. He said the Iraqi report was put down to a rumor started by a rival exporter. The chairman then called on witnesses from the inspector general's office and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who had testified earlier and were still among the spectators. Officials of the inspector general's office of the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> told the hearing that their investigation indicated guarantees were provided only for exports that were 100 percent American. They said they were told that the only exception was for a type of baby food that contained a small amount of oil not produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> told the panel the baby food example indicated that `` the possibility existed'' that blended exports could receive credit guarantees.

 <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s complex, cumbersome government structure and diversity of nationalities are major factors in its worsening ethnic and economic problems. Here is some background in question-and-answer form: Q: How does the government work? A: <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is a federation of six republics and two autonomous provinces that are administrative parts of the largest republic, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. Power rests in the League of Communists, or <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Each republic and province has its own party hierarchy for political leadership and its own government for administration. Each republic and autonomous province sends representatives to the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> leadership, headed by a 23-member Politburo, and the nine-man federal presidency. Leadership of those two bodies rotates annually. Only the premier of the federal government, which is primarily responsible for overseeing the economy and national defense, holds office for four years. The premier can be removed by a majority vote of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Q: Why is the system so complex? A: The 23 million Yugoslavs include about 30 nationalities. In an apparent attempt to prevent ethnic strife after his death, President <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> approved a 1974 constitution giving broad powers to each republic and province. He decreed that all decisions on major political questions must be approved by the leaderships of all republics and provinces, and national leadership posts would rotate annually to keep any republic from dominating. Q: What happened after <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>'s death in 1980? A: Unanimity is so hard to achieve that federal decision are weak compromises, and the largely state-run economy has deteriorated as a result. The foreign debt is $ 21 billion, unemployment 15 percent and the annual inflation rate 217 percent. More than 1,500 strikes were reported in 1987. Economic and political differences have grown between the rich northern region, which looks to the West, and the poorer, more backward south. Q: What is causing the current unrest? A: A mixture of ethnic strife, economic crisis and an ineffective political system. One fundamental element is the ethnic dispute in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, a backward autonomous province in south that was the heart of medieval <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s great empire. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> now is dominated by predominantly Moslem ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON>, who have the highest birthrate in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and are 90 percent of the province's 2 million people. Minority Serbs, most of whom are <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, say they are being harassed and began holding rallies in July. Serbs in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> found a supporter in the Serbian Communist party leader, <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who is trying to impose more Serbian control on <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and the other autonomous province, <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s opponents accuse him of using the street protests to seek greater national power for himself and <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a difficult neighbor, but living next to such a powerful country has made <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> more independent. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said that during his six-year term the two countries have improved understanding on the thorny issue of illegal drug trafficking. Industrialized countries in general, he said, have begun to understand that developing nations' foreign debt problems affect the entire world economy. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, 54, turns the government over to his successor, former Budget Secretary <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, on Dec. 1, after presiding over some of the country's most difficult years. Both men are from the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has not lost a major office since it was founded in 1929. `` Relations between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have always been very difficult, so difficult that we lost half our territory in the last century,'' de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said in the interview Wednesday. But the challenge of living next to such a wealthy and complicated country, he said, has made Mexicans more nationalistic. `` Perhaps that is one of the great advantages of being a neighbor of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>: our desire to continue being an independent and sovereign nation that rules its own destiny,'' he said. `` I believe the basis of the problems is a lack of knowledge of each other,'' de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said. Two-thirds of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s trade, tourism and investment are from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and there is a constant flow of citizens back and forth across the border. The result is continuous problems of immigration, trade, drug trafficking and foreign policy differences, particularly on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> backs rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government and supports the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> government's war against leftist rebels there. It has failed to win the support it would like from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which opposes the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention and has been more sympathetic to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s government and the Salvadoran rebels. `` There are some in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who think that because <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is an independent country with its own foreign policy that it is not a friend of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I do not believe that is true. We are friends of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but in some things we do not think alike.'' Illegal narcotics trafficking through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has been one of the biggest sources of conflict between the two countries during de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s term. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and other top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have recognized <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s efforts to fight drug trafficking, de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said. However, he added, `` there are lower-level officials who, to avoid responsibility, put the blame on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. It seems to me an infantile attitude.'' He said he believed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have recognized the importance of demand for illegal drugs in the problem of drug trafficking. `` That is a great advance, since you have to accept the reality that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the biggest consumer of drugs in the world and that constitutes an enormous motive to promote production or transportation from other parts of the world,'' he said. He said there were `` slight and tenuous signs'' of understanding that the developing countries' huge foreign debts have worldwide implications. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s $ 104 billion foreign debt is the second highest in the Third World, after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> said both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential candidates, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, along with European leaders, have recognized that ways must be found to overcome the problem. `` What is needed now is for that recognition to be converted into political will and specific formulas,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> insists on joint responsibility of debtor and creditor for the debt,'' he said. `` It is not possible that, in the case of the Latin American countries, we resign ourselves to the economic stagnation of a growing population with so many needs.'' He said debtor nations must `` set our house in order internally'' while demanding `` a fair and realistic deal from creditors.'' De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> has maintained <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s commitment to keep up with debt service payments, establishing unpopular austerity measures. Subsidies were eliminated, prices went up and workers' salaries lost more than half their buying power. `` But my concern was to protect the majorities and to do that we had to defend the productive sectors and employment,'' he said.

 Drawings and cash prizes may sound like `` Let's Make A Deal,'' but the gimmicks have found their way into a pair of election races this year. A <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> congressional candidate said Tuesday he is raffling away $ 10,000 to `` a lucky taxpayer,'' and a New Yorker is offering $ 100 to reporters who can get Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, to answer a question about taxes. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> ploy was hatched by Republican <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a former state senator who is challenging Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON> in the 8th Congressional District of suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said he is buying full-page newspaper ads asking voters to reply to 20 questions comparing <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s records The ads attack <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>'s voting record on crime, education, taxes and other issues. `` Simply give us your opinion on twenty questions ... send your answers to us.. and we'll enter your name in a drawing,'' the ad says `` If your name is chosen, we'll send you the $ 10,000.'' The ads will cost <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> about $ 20,000, he said. Only registered voters can participate in the raffle, and they have until Oct. 28 to clip out and mail their coupons to the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> campaign. A Kostmayer statement suggested <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> was running for `` a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> game show host,'' but <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> countered that the raffle was meant to counter the free mailing privileges and other advantages that stack the election odds in favor of an incumbent. The raffle does not run afoul of state lottery-sweepstakes law because the contest does not require participants to make a contribution to qualify, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Brackbill </PERSON> said. Added <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiland </PERSON>, `` In general, there is nothing in the law that would deal with this type of thing.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign stunt is focused more on the media than the public. Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> first offered $ 100 to any <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> reporter who `` successfuly reached Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, himself, by telephone and asked him about any issues of the campaign and received coherent answers.'' When a reporter claimed the prize, <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> offered a new $ 100 reward to a reporter who could get <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> to explain a series of votes that <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> claimed raised New Yorkers' tax burden.

<HEAD>Gay Rights Group Lauds Decision On Anti-Discrimination Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The executive director of a gay rights group says the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is `` finally catching up with legal reality'' by declaring that anti-discrimination laws extend to federal employees with the AIDS virus. An opinion issued Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION> concludes that the federal Rehabilitation Act _ which protects the handicapped in the federal workforce or in programs receiving federal aid _ also applies to employees with the AIDS virus. The opinion is in line with a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling last year and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is `` finally catching up with legal reality,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. Many state handicapped laws have already been changed to protect people infected with AIDS. In view of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> opinion and other court rulings, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s revised position is `` a little late in coming; in fact it's a lot late in coming,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, staff attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Education Fund. The opinion says that those with the AIDS virus in whom the disease has progressed can be excluded from the workplace if they pose a threat to the health or safety of others or are unable to do their job. Since the available medical information shows that the risk of infection being transmitted in the normal course of the workplace is very low, an AIDS-infected employee `` by and large ... should be treated like any other employee,'' Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kmiec </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. <PERSON> Kmiec </PERSON> said an AIDS-infected employee `` should be assessed for his ability to do the job like anyone else.'' The legal opinion differs sharply from an opinion his predecessor, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, issued in June 1986, that employers may discriminate against victims of contagious diseases such as AIDS based on an irrational fear of contagion. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected that argument last year, extending the protection of the federal Rehabilitation Act to people handicapped by contagious disease, including AIDS. The legal opinion adheres to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement of last August in which he said that federal employers should treat those infected with the AIDS virus like any other employees, as long as they do n't pose health and safety dangers or performance problems. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> issued a statement with <PERSON> Kmiec </PERSON>'s opinion saying there are legitimate questions as to whether existing laws to protect the handicapped can adequately serve AIDS victims He noted that the Rehabilitation Act was passed in 1973, well before the advent of AIDS. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious disease that affects the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread through contact with blood, blood products or semen. As of Monday, 74,809 people had been reported as having AIDS since 1981, of whom 42,142 have died. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. Sixty-two percent of those with AIDS are homosexual or bisexual males, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. As many as 1.5 million Americans are infected with the AIDS virus, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> estimates.

<HEAD>Former Longshot Mack Heading Into Final Stretch Against Democratic

 Although <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had a major league name, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman was still viewed as a minor player in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> politics when he began his challenge one year ago for three-term, Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>' seat. Today, a well-funded <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> is heading into the final stretch against the survivor of a bruising Democratic primary, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>. Since the day <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> formally announced his plans _ Oct. 19, 1987 _ the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressman has watched his fortunes rise with the decision of each potential opponent. The 58-year-old <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, stunned his party in December by deciding not to seek re-election. Then Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Reubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>, the former two-term governor, abruptly withdrew May 7, citing weariness with the amount of time spent raising funds. The decisions by <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> triggered a six-way Democratic race in which <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> made a late comeback to finish second in the Sept. 6 primary, then overtook <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, the state's Insurance Commissioner since 1976, in a runoff on Tuesday. Polling by the <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> campaign showed MacKay gaining momentum prior to the runoff so the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate went after his likely opponent with an ad campaign titled, `` Hey Buddy, You're Liberal. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> describes his rival as a tax-loving, wild-spending liberal while portraying himself as a conservative Republican cut from the same cloth as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I think that <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is a conservative state and I represent a conservative viewpoint,'' said <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a former bank president and grandson of his namesake, the famous <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> and Hall of Fame baseball manager. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, who was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1982, has one of the most conservative records in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, scoring 90-plus percent on the scorecards of conservative rating groups and sometimes zero in marks from liberal rating organizations. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> has criticized his rival for opposing military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, the MX missile and the B-1 bomber, and for voting for congressional pay hikes. `` There is a clear choice between conservative <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> and liberal <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, who has stuck to a theme of `` less taxes, less spending, less government, more freedom.'' <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, an attorney from a wealthy central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> family, generally shunned big-spending programs, according to his congressional record, but is more open to government involvement than <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. While serving in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since 1982, <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> has been active in deficit-reduction. During his tenure in the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, he was a leader in civil rights and open government. `` We need to talk about each of our records, what we have done,'' said <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>. `` The issues remain the same, who can do the best job for the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. I intend to talk specifics during the general election, I do n't intend to allow Mr. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> to continue talking generalities and philosophies.'' <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, who has said he would consider new taxes to deal with the escalating national deficit, also plans to make <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s environmental record an issue `` The people of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are concerned about the environment and <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s record on the environment is one of the worst ... not just in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> delegation where it's the worst, but in all of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>. `` That's not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. Republicans care about the environment as much as Democrats.'' While the negative Democratic campaign between <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> and <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> led to predictions of a divided party, <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> quickly promised to work for MacKay. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> had attacked <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>'s integrity, while <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> had charged that <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> betrayed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, senior citizens and the anti-drug effort with votes in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> rode the support of his party's hierarchy and a $ 2 million campaign warchest to a primary victory over former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> entered the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary just 10 weeks before the Sept. 6 election and without any money, he was able to attract nearly 40 percent of the vote against the telegenic <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, meanwhile, was building momentum. After polls in the final month before the primary showed him running third, he slipped past Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mica </PERSON> to make the runoff against <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>. The Republicans have targeted <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in their hopes of regaining a majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. A strong showing by Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is expected to win the state, could also hurt <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>. And then there is the money factor. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s campaign has raised more than $ 4 million, including $ 860,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s national <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee, and spent about $ 3.5 million to maintain his media effort. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> raised and spent $ 1.5 million he needed to reach the general election. The national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is expected to give <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> $ 700,000.

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> missed a once-in-a-campaign opportunity to bury doubts about his competence to serve as president if need be, several political analysts say. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s halting and at times unresponsive answers at the vice presidential debate to repeated questions about his readiness to lead the country left some Republicans shaking their heads. `` As a Republican, I sat there trying to pull words out of his mouth,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>. `` Frankly, I think there are a lot of family dogs that could have answered the question better.'' `` I think he was so afraid of striking out that he never swung the bat,'' <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON> said. During Wednesday's debate in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleague <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> repeatedly cited his 12 years' service in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as his principal qualification for the vice presidency. When asked what he would do in the event of a presidential death, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said he would pray for himself and the country and then call a meeting of Cabinet members and top presidential advisers. He said little more, though pressed by questioners. Among those dissatisfied with the response was conservative direct-mail fund-raiser <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did all right on all the questions but those concerning his qualification and fitness for the vice presidency. `` I'm sympathetic to the guy because he was too coached ... and told, ` Whatever you do, do n't do this and do n't do that,''' <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, denied on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was overprogrammed for the face-off. He said he believed there was `` a lot more spontaneity'' than in the debate between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I think he did make some headway, but I think that public opinion was so critical of him beforehand that he had nowhere to go but up,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, a conservative columnist who served for a time as <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> communications director for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said `` this whole debate was about <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and I think, under pressure, he did quite well. And I do n't think anybody ... is going to say, `` Well, gee, this fellow's not even qualified to be vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fingerhut </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> pollster, said `` I do n't think he -LRB- <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> -RRB- did resolve the question'' regarding his qualifications for the office. `` For the hard-core Democrats and Republicans. this thing meant nothing,'' he said. `` It was just a reaffirmation of views they already held. I just think that ... people who are in the middle -LRB- undecided -RRB- are as interested as the media are in the question about his fitness.'' `` Actually, the people who think <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s a jerk will still vote the ticket if they like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he said.

 Dead quail have been placed at several downtown locations in an effort to attract and identify an endangered peregrine falcon that has been spotted flying among office buildings. `` We're not sure when it showed up,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, an urban biologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We had two last year, December through March.'' The falcon has an identification band on its leg, but conservationists will need a closer look to determine where it came from. One of the birds spotted last year was discovered to be from the Yukon; the other was hatched at a conservation site in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>. To attract the bird and determine its origin, the <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is putting dead quail on a ledge on the 18th floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> and in a nesting box atop another building, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said Conservationists think the bird may have come from a falcon release site in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, the nearest such site to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Six falcons recently were released there, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said. If the new falcon was hatched in captivity, it should be attracted to the quail, the main meal at the release sites. Wild falcons generally do n't eat killed prey, feeding instead on live birds they snare as they swoop down at up to 200 mph from their perches, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said this is the migration season for the birds, which fly each year to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Workers downtown hope the birds will stick around awhile. `` It's really been the highlight of the fall season,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Noack </PERSON>, a lawyer on the 18th floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION>.

 To invoke the name of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is to enter a political realm in which the fine print of history does n't count The Kennedy lore and legend are recalled by politicians of both parties now, 25 years after the assassination in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. But it is best done carefully, especially by Republicans. By the numbers, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> got his history just about right when he compared his experience and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s. But he left himself open to the sharpest rebuff of his Wednesday night debate with Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It was as though <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had been waiting for the Kennedy comparison, one <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has made before when questions of experience confront him in his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential campaign. He hit the trigger as soon as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that he'd had as much experience in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as had <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> when he sought the presidency. `` Senator,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, `` I served with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. I knew <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' Actually, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had n't claimed that he was, only that he'd been in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as long. He was off by two years. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> served 14 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been there for 12. But the broader interpretation of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s statement was more effective ammunition for the Democratic vice presidential nominee. It has ignited a barrage of Democratic criticism, and ridicule, of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on grounds that he claimed to be an incipient JFK. For the record, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in 1946, served three terms, was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1952 and re-elected in 1958. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1976, beat Democrat <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> to win his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in 1980, and won a second term in 1986. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> served three terms in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, two while <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was there. He returned to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1971, this time as a senator, defeating <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to win the seat. While <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> may have walked into a new campaign problem with the <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> comparison there are some parallels. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is 41; <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was 43 when he ran for president, 39 when he made a losing bid for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nomination. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been under attack for what his critics call a sub-par congressional record. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> faced the same kind of attacks when he began his presidential campaign in 1960. His opponents said he'd accomplished little or nothing in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and was too often absent Even after <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had proven himself in presidential primary elections, detractors questioned his credentials, and complained that his family fortune was buying his way to the nomination. Republican Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the party chairman who later ran for vice president, said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was trying to `` turn the White House into the house that <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> bought.'' With <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on the threshold of the presidential nomination, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> quit as a delegate, saying the national convention was rigged for <ORGANIZATION> JFK </ORGANIZATION> and suggested that the senator step aside in favor of `` someone with the greatest possible maturity and experience.'' `` Are you certain you are quite ready for the country, or that the country is ready for you in the role of president?'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> asked in a televised address. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said yes, that it was time for a young man, for vigor, for a new generation. While some of those accusations echo now, so do the distinctions between the Kennedy of 1960 and the Quayle of 1988. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a World War II hero. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s candidacy got off to a shaky start because of controversy over his Vietnam-era hometown service in the National Guard. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s academic credentials have been questioned; <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s were not <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had published two books; he'd won a Pulitzer Prize for `` Profiles in Courage.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> speechwriter, said the people who questioned his experience in 1960 were on sound ground. `` They were right,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said. `` He'd been in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a couple of terms and he'd just started serving his second term in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` But people perceived in him qualities of intelligence and sympathy or understanding, whatever the voters were looking for.'' The experience argument was replayed in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> when Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> sought the Democratic nomination to succeed his brother in 1962. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, the state attorney general, ran against him. `` If his name was <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, with his qualifications, with your qualifications, <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON>, if it was <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, your candidacy would be a joke,'' <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in a televised debate. The observation was accurate, but the backlash was fierce, and the primary was no contest. The name was <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> said it will include several panels of the 750-by-500-foot AIDS quilt in its collection documenting the history of the disease. The quilt panels will be added to the Museum of American History's Division of Medical Sciences. The 3-by-6-foot panels were made by individuals to commemorate the deaths of infants, brothers, sisters, parents and their children, friends and assorted celebrities, including entertainers <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>. More than one-fifth of the approximately 42,000 Americans who died of AIDS since June 1981 are represented on the quilt. The panels will join other objects, graphics and educational materials in the collection documenting the medical and social history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. <PERSON> Cleve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, executive director of the NAMES project that produced the quilt, said <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, wife of Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, had agreed to participate in ceremonies marking display of the quilt this Saturday and Sunday in the capital. Some 8,288 panels will be laid out on the Ellipse, an open area behind the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and the remainder will be on display at other points in the capital. Once on display, the quilt will measure 375,000 square feet interspersed with five miles of walkway and 11 miles of trimming. Invitations had been extended to the major presidential candidates and their wives but `` the -LRB- George -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign said they were busy,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. The quilt, which began in 1986 when <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> made the first panel for a friend of his who died of AIDS, has quadrupled in size _ from 1,920 to 8,800 panels _ since its first display in the capital last year. A national tour of the quilt in 20 cities raised $ 500,000 for AIDS charities and resulted in quilt-making workshops. Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., said he hoped publicity about the quilt would move members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to complete action on legislation currently in conference committee in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> designed to aid research and AIDS victims

 When it comes to the marriage business, the Rev. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> will tie the knot in just about any fashion, just as long as the fashion includes clothes. `` A couple called and asked if I would marry them in the buff,'' <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> said. `` I thought she said ` on the bus' and I said sure. ... I did the wedding, but we all had clothes on.'' What started as a way to supplement his income as pastor of the 70-member <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> seven years ago has become a passion for <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON>, and, he says, a very important part of his ministry. It was n't long before <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON>, 42, began getting requests from people who were turned down by other pastors in town because they did n't want a church ceremony. Though <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> takes the institution of marriage seriously, he has no reservations about performing weddings in some not-so-serious settings. `` The Bible talks about commitment _ that's the heart of marriage. It's not where you get married that matters,'' said <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON>, who also does marriage counseling. <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> estimates about 80 percent of the weddings he performs are at homes. The rest have been in such offbeat places as the top level of a downtown parking ramp, on a 400-foot sand dune with both bride and groom sitting on a motorcycle, on a city skateboard ramp, and at a construction site where a couple planned to build their home. His biggest wedding was performed two years ago on the ice before 5,000 people at <LOCATION> L.C </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Muskegon </LOCATION>, just before the start of an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> game. <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> said he does n't pry too much into the reasons a couple has for wanting to get married in an unusual place. `` I learned a long time ago that you ca n't explain love,'' he said.

 The birth of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Piechocki </PERSON>'s first child was a real labor of love after she won a long battle with immigration officials to be reunited with her Polish husband just hours before the baby's birth. Mrs. <PERSON> Piechocki </PERSON>, already in labor, traveled to <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday against the advice of her doctors to greet her husband, <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON>. She was admitted to <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON>'s maternity ward back in <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> on Thursday morning and gave birth to her son, 8-pound, 6-ounce <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, at 5:26 p.m., said <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON>, a hospital spokeswoman. `` Everyone's doing fine,'' Ms. <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON> said. The couple met almost eight years ago when both were working in the village of <LOCATION> Ruda-Slaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. They were engaged to be married before Mrs. <PERSON> Piechocki </PERSON> emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with her family in May 1986. She visited <PERSON> Piechocki </PERSON> twice in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ first to marry him and the second time for a six-month stay. She discovered she was pregnant after she returned from the second visit. When she immigrated, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> assured her that her fiancee would be allowed to join her within 15 months. But a backup in paperwork at the Embassy delayed their reunion, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Snider </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>'s office got involved after Mrs. <PERSON> Piechocki </PERSON> called for help in August, <PERSON> Snider </PERSON> said <PERSON> Piechocki </PERSON>'s visa did n't come through until Monday, Mrs. <PERSON> Piechocki </PERSON>'s due date. `` Fortunately, she was late,'' <PERSON> Snider </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Piechocki </PERSON>'s visa allows him to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> indefinitely, and he'll be eligible to apply for citizenship in five years, <PERSON> Snider </PERSON> said.

 Shifts in Soviet ideology are following the shake-up in the Soviet power structure as <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> solidifies his rule and pursues radical change both in the economy and in relations with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The Soviet leader is stepping up momentum, defying the judgment of some analysts in the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and prestigious <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tanks that he is running out of gas and that his colleagues in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> are losing patience with him. For the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president the changes are less frightening than intellectually challenging. The Soviets' new chief ideologist, <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, suggested in a speech published Wednesday in Pravda that conflict with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was no longer considered inevitable by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Present-day realities,'' he said, `` mean that ` universal values' such as avoiding war and ecological catastrophe must outweigh the idea of a struggle between the classes. Peaceful coexistence, as we see it today, is a lengthy, long-term process whose historic limits are difficult to determine.'' The implication is that the Soviets under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> want to reduce the risks of conflict with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and concentrate on economic improvements such as expanding current experiments with cooperative ownership and renting property to farmers and merchants. This could make the current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential debate over which <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> weapons to develop and which to scrap a little beside the point. In dealing with the Soviets beginning next January the focus may be on devising a strategy for dealing not with a potential aggressor but with a thoughtful adversary who is likely to generate a steady stream of proposals for arms control and an easing of regional tensions. Joint commitments are being developed even now to outlaw chemical weapons, halt the proliferation of ballistic missiles among less advanced countries and revamp the World Court. And yet, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and their running mates have spent little time on foreign policy and even less on how they would cope with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as the Soviet system evolves into something new and unprecedented. When the candidates venture beyond domestic issues, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> generally hammers at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for not supporting development of all the weapons the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is backing. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in turn, tries to be reassuring about his commitment to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defenses. But how would they deal with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, are sounding the traditional conservative themes of a powerful military structure and keeping a wary eye on the Russians. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his running mate, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, are playing down ideology and playing up `` competence.'' In 1960, when <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was pondering a running mate for his first race for the presidency, he assembled 36 party elders at a midnight meeting in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The governor of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>, offered this advice: `` You can say all you want about foreign affairs, but what is really important is the price of hogs in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' Maybe <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> was right. And then again, maybe events in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1988 call for a little more attention to foreign policy.

<HEAD>NRC Attacked Over Proposed Substance Abuse Regulation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 A proposed federal regulation to require regular drug testing of atomic plant workers is under attack on Capitol Hill for lacking similar standards to curb alcohol abuse. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced a proposed `` fitness for duty'' rule last month that would require reactor owners to conduct random drug tests, test employees based on cause, report drug use to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> and mandate personnel sanctions. The proposal also would require utilities to submit their own alcohol programs providing `` reasonable assurance'' that plant operators are sober, but `` leaves to the discretion of each licensee the specific measures to be used,'' <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Thursday. `` It is as if the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is saying that it is less concerned with someone being drunk in the control room than it is with someone being high on drugs,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> and Insular Affairs subcommittee on oversight and investigations <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> and other lawmakers have long urged the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to impose strict drug and alcohol standards instead of leaving it up individual utilities. <PERSON> Zech </PERSON>, under heavy criticism from both Democrats and Republicans on the subcommittee, stressed that the `` fitness for duty'' rule was simply a proposal and could be changed to include specific alcohol standards before it is issued next year. But he defended the commission's decision to remove strict alcohol provisions that were in earlier drafts of the regulation. <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said it was more difficult to develop a consensus on alcohol standards than drug restrictions, noting the different blood alcohol levels used by various states and federal agencies to determine inebriation. Trying to include specific alcohol requirements in the rule could have delayed the final regulation `` another few months or maybe longer,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said. But lawmakers were befuddled and angered by that explanation. `` You're sitting around and waiting for -LRB- utility companies -RRB- to tell you how to do it,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>. `` Do n't you have some idea what the minimum standard ought to This is not a new subject.'' Rep. <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, a Republican who is often at odds with the Democrats' criticism, agreed with <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>. `` I think your judgment needs to be questioned,'' he told the commissioners. `` It just does n't make sense'' not to include the alcohol provision, he said. <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> pointed to an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> document that concluded that alcohol abuse and drinking-related problems `` are judged to present a vastly more pervasive work place problem than does drug abuse.'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said he agreed with that statement, but another commissioner said drug abuse presented a bigger problem than alcohol because he believes drug use is more difficult to notice. Commissioner <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, a former submarine commander, said he `` threw people out of the submarine force for a first -LRB- drug -RRB- offense when everybody else said that was the wrong thing to do. I did n't ever throw anybody out for being drunk because I could tell when a guy was drunk and I did n't put him in a sensitive position.'' `` That may be the problem,'' <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> said. `` We're very tolerant of being intoxicated as a society.''

 The government, faced with relentless rocket attacks in the heart of the capital, has scheduled an emergency meeting to discuss ways to make peace with the U.S.-backed guerrillas. Government spokesmen said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> would meet Monday to discuss `` important matters,'' including efforts to bring the guerrillas into talks with the government Vice President <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatif </PERSON>, in an interview Thursday during a flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, said `` a concerted effort of all mentalities and from all walks of life is urgently needed.'' However, he called the guerrillas `` irresponsible people with complicated weapons'' and accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of continuing to the guerrillas, who are seeking to topple the Soviet-backed Marxist government. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> police escorted three Western reporters to homes they said were hit by guerrilla rockets the previous day. A total of 42 rockets hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in less than three hours Wednesday morning, killing 13 people and wounding 34, according to <PERSON> Qurban </PERSON> <PERSON> Shayrzad </PERSON>, the city's deputy police chief. One home shown to reporters was occupied by a soldier, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, who said four women and one boy in his family were killed when a rocket hit the wall around their home on the north edge of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. At another nearby house, four girls between the ages of 2 and 9 were killed by a rocket, according to their uncle, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON>. On Sept. 28, at least 33 people were killed and more than 130 wounded in the worst round of rocket attacks on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in recent memory. In other attacks around the country, anti-government guerrillas fired rockets at the southern city of <LOCATION> Kandagar </LOCATION>, hitting a hospital and killing dozens of people, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The Soviet news agency, quoting its Afghan counterpart <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION>, said three patients and a nurse were among those killed in Wednesday's attack. On Thursday, a rocket attack killed a woman and her four children in their house in the city of <LOCATION> Charinkara </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Parvan </LOCATION> province. A mine planted by terrorists tore apart a bus Wednesday in <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> province. Twenty-three passengers were killed and 13 seriously injured, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> told reporters at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news briefing that Soviet troops had broken a guerrilla blockade of the city of <LOCATION> Paghman </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> province. He said the siege was ended after several days of fighting. Despite government assertions, several <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> civilians, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed belief that some of the rockets have been fired by Soviet or Afghan troops, who then blamed the guerrillas in an effort to alienate their supporters. The guerrillas, who call themselves <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> or Islamic Holy Warriors, have steadfastly refused to deal with the government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hatif </PERSON>, who said he does not belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is one of four vice presidents named by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> four months ago in a show of broadening the base of his government However, key positions in the Soviet-backed government _ including the presidency _ are held by the party or by politicians closely associated with it.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Bans Smoking By Newly Hired Police And Firefighters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> fire stations, they're talking about smoking, not smoke. A new state law, the first of its kind in the nation, forbids all newly hired police officers and firefighters from smoking cigars or cigarettes, on or off the job. The statute, enacted last year, took effect Thursday and met with huffs and puffs of resentment across the state. `` This is going to get jammed up in the courts, probably the very first time they try to enforce it,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a lobbyist for the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The association and other unions contend the law _ intended to cut disability pension costs _ infringes on their members' private lives and may be unconstitutional. State legislators agree that the law is virtually certain to be challenged, but they maintain it can withstand constitutional scrutiny because it affects only new recruits. All of the 21,300 policemen and 23,500 firefighters in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> are exempt. They can go on smoking as long as they like. But new state and municipal officers will be told that abstaining from smoking is a condition of their employment. If they violate the ban at any time in their careers, they could be fired. Rank-and-file officers in several communities said they did not object to the purpose of the law, but felt it went too far. `` It's like the seat belt thing,'' said Patrolman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Goyette </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the state's mandatory seat belt law, which was repealed by voters two years ago. `` It's good for you, but I believe in free choice I think you should be free to kill yourself if you want.'' The answer from legislators, in effect, was that killing yourself is one thing, but asking the taxpayers to pay for it is another. The law's primary author, Rep. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchette </PERSON>, D-Lawrence, defended it as a compromise with unions to help shore up the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' pension system. Under the state's so-called heart law, any heart ailment a policeman or firefighter develops automatically is presumed to have resulted from job-related stress. Firefighters enjoy an additional presumption for lung disease because they frequently inhale smoke and dangerous fumes. The presumption makes it relatively easy for a policeman or firefighter to obtain a disability pension, which provides 72 percent of the officer's final salary, plus an annuity and an allowance for dependents, all tax-free. Other public employees who retire with heart or lung ailments receive far smaller pensions, unless they can prove that the ailments are job-related. <PERSON> Blanchette </PERSON> said he supports the heart and lung presumptions, because `` our public safety officers are our first line of defense, and they do have hazardous occupations.'' But, he said, the law needed to take the risks of tobacco use into account. `` If a firefighter comes down with emphysema, it's presumed to be job-related, even if he has been smoking two packs a day for 20 years,'' <PERSON> Blanchette </PERSON> said. `` That does n't make a lot of sense.'' Only a few hundred officers will be affected by the law this year. But starting in 1989, about 1,100 police recruits and 600 new firefighters are expected to come under the law each year, according to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, president of the 12,000-member Professional Firefighters of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said his union is unhappy with the smoking ban, but predicted the issue will fade. `` The generation coming on now is pretty much non-smokers anyway,'' he said. `` They want to be healthy.''

 Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> says that in meetings next week with East European leaders he will offer improved economic relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in exchange for greater respect for human rights. `` Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is at an important crossroads,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> told reporters Thursday. `` Fundamentally, what these -LRB- Soviet bloc -RRB- regimes want from us are economic support, trade ties and political recognition,'' he said. `` We have stated our willingness to be helpful, provided we see real progress in political and economic reform, and greater tangible respect for the human rights of the citizens in each of these countries.'' He said he had made this point in previous meetings with East European officials. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its European allies `` must work together to use this historic opportunity to advance peaceful, positive change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the good of all the peoples of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said he would re-emphasize to the East European leaders the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of `` treating the Eastern European countries not as a bloc, but as individual states, each with their own history and culture.'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said his sixth trip to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> starting Sunday would take him to the capital of each of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> allies in the region _ <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Way To Change Whooping Cough Bacteria Genetically</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers have discovered a way to alter the whooping cough bacteria genetically in order to produce a safer vaccine to combat the dangerous childhood disease. Dr. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> scientist, said Thursday that his research team discovered that by merely substituting one amino acid for another in a single subunit of the whooping cough bacteria gene, they could cause the bacteria to lose a toxic reaction that has caused troublesome side effects. Despite the development of a vaccine more than 40 years ago, whooping cough, or pertussis, strikes about 60 million children a year worldwide. About 1 million die. Most children in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are vaccinated against whooping cough during their first three years of life. Thus the disease is rarely contracted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But pediatricians report about 70 infants a year suffer some side effect from the pertussis vaccine. This is thought to be caused by a toxin that is included in the vaccine now used. Side effects can include swelling and redness around the injection, persistent crying among infants and, in severe cases, brain damage. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said the goal of his research was to use genetic engineering to eliminate the toxic effects from the vaccine while retaining the portion of the bacteria that causes the patient to develop immunity. The pertussis gene was cloned in 1986 by <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> and his team at the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. Since then, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said, the group has been attempting to find the genetic source of the toxin that causes side effects in pertussis vaccine. `` The idea was to go in and change the bacteria genetically so it is no longer toxic, but still causes a very positive immunological response,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>. `` It turns out that if a single amino acid change is made, that's enough.'' <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said the researchers removed the gene from the pertussis bacteria and placed it inside a laboratory bacteria. They then experimented until finding which subunit of the gene was responsible for the toxin. When that unit was found, the scientist removed one of 234 amino acids in the subunit and implanted a new amino acid. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said it will take months of testing in test tubes and animals before a new whooping cough vaccine would be ready to test on humans. In addition to <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, other scientists conducting the research were <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mar </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Amgen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Thousands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Witold </PERSON> <PERSON> Cieplak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kaarel </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaljot </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Hiroko </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A report on the research is published in today's issue of Science, the journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Rowan Accuses Mayor Of Trying To Influence Gun Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> mayor and other city officials tried to `` extort'' favorable newspaper columns by suggesting weapons charges against <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> could be dropped. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> claimed Thursday that Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and other senior city officials had suggested they could influence the highly-publicized weapons case against him if he stopped denouncing corruption in city government. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> denied the charge. `` Unfortunately Mr. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> made some extreme charges. ... However, I am too disciplined emotionally and have too much dignity to get into a debate with Mr. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. On Wednesday the city announced it would not seek to retry <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who has called in his column for tougher gun control, on charges of illegal possession of a handgun and ammunition. A two-day trial on the charges last week ended in a hung jury. During a poolside press conference at his home _ where he had used the gun last June to wound a teenage intruder _ <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said he was pleased that the city had decided not to try the case again. He claimed, however, that the entire episode was `` a malicious, political prosecution from day one.'' But <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> countered: `` The fact of the matter is, we have a very strong gun control law in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. If you possess an unregistered handgun, as Mr. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> did, it is a case that should be discussed between the Corporation Counsel, judges and juries, which is the way this case was handled.'' The columnist alleged Thursday that <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s closest advisers, had contacted <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, after the shooting. `` My son reported to me immediately that <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> had told him that the mayor's public posture on the gun issue would improve if I would ` lower my voice' about corruption in the city,'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> flatly denied the charge Thursday, calling it a `` baldfaced lie.'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> also alleged that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> _ who had criticized <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> publicly for the shooting _ called his son June 28 to say that Corporation Counsel <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, the city's top attorney, could not make a decision to prosecute the case without his input. <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> refused to comment on the matter. In addition, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> claimed that on July 29, after the charges had been filed against him, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., called his wife at <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s request and left her a number where <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> could `` call <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and perhaps get him to drop the charges. `` I never called <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> because I feared that he would claim that I telephoned him trying to ` cut a deal,''' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> confirmed making the call, but <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>' spokesman, said the congressman was unaware of any possible ulterior motives by <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> frequently criticizes the district government in his columns. `` None of us can be proud to live in a city that wallows in incompetence,'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said. `` You deserve a mayor and other city officials whom your children can regard as inspirations to great achievement. What you have now is venality, ignorance, lack of couth, and an absence of conscience at the top.''

<HEAD>Government Says Emperor's Illness Won't Spur Rightists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is dismissing worries that the flood of sympathy for ailing Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> will trigger new demands that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> revive its military might. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yoshifumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> said Thursday the illness of the world's longest-reigning monarch will not create pressure to change the post-war constitution, which forbids use of military force. `` There will be no such general voices coming up towards that direction or to think about the constitution or a change of course,'' he said. The official sought in particular to discredit what he called the `` strange opinions'' of conservative author <PERSON> Hideaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kase </PERSON>. The writer's remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last week were reported by some journalists as portending a surge of nationalism during a post-Hirohito transition. Rightists, including some members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, would like to change the constitution to restore some of the emperor's traditional status and allow <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to be more of a military power. The 87-year-old emperor, who took power in 1926, has been bedridden since internal hemorrhaging caused him to cough up blood Sept. 19. He is being fed intravenously and has received daily blood transfusions. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> remained in stable condition today. Rightists have worked quietly behind the scenes to increase public sympathy for <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> since he fell ill. The effort has been led by <PERSON> Shizuka </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamei </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fellow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thinkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Fundamental National Issues. <PERSON> Kamei </PERSON> spearheaded the drive to set up nationwide registries for people to sign and wish <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> a speedy recovery. `` It's not nationalism or revisionism,'' <PERSON> Kamei </PERSON> has said. `` The emperor is like our father, and he is sick.'' <PERSON> Kamei </PERSON> is in favor of revising the constitution. Earlier this year, he and his group supported a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister who was forced to resign for saying <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was not an aggressor in World War II but was simply fighting to protect itself `` at a time when the white race had turned Asian into a colony.'' Leftists have criticized both <PERSON> Kamei </PERSON> and the government, saying they are creating an unwarranted mood of mourning with such things as the registries and the many cancellations of trips by Cabinet members. Mainstream newspapers and some governing party members also have criticized the government for overreacting to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s illness. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has said government business should go on normally as much as possible. Asked at Thursday's weekly briefing for foreign journalists if rightists would be able to open debate on revising the constitition in view of the outpouring of sympathy for the emperor, <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> replied, `` Absolutely not.'' <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> said the correspondents' club made a `` very great mistake'' by inviting <PERSON> Kase </PERSON>, who he said represented `` just a handful of people in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar constitution, largely imposed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation authorities, not only forbids use of military force but also ends the emperor's role as living god and source of all political authority. The constitution now defines the emperor as `` the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people'' and gives him only ceremonial duties. The militarists who ran the country before and during World War II invoked <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> as inspiration for attacks that put most of East Asia under Japanese rule. But opinion polls consistently show the public is largely content with the emperor's symbolic role and the low level of military spending in today's <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Jury Says S&amp;L Officials Liable For Damages In Thrift Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury has ruled that six former officials of the defunct Community Savings and Loan of <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> are liable for $ 112 million in damages stemming from the thrift's demise. The jury returned the verdict Thursday after five days of deliberation, ruling that the officers misused deposits that financed an ultimately disastrous real estate venture known as <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, or EPIC. The $ 112 million was sought in compensatory damages by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, which took control of Community when its financial mismanagement contributed to the state's 1985 savings and loan crisis. The defendants in the longest trial in the court's history included <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Billman </PERSON>, who founded EPIC in 1975 and later acquired Community. Attorneys for the state deposit insurance fund, which filed the lawsuit two years ago, alleged that <PERSON> Billman </PERSON> and others drove Community into insolvency by misusing its deposits to enrich themselves and to `` feed the EPIC machine.'' Prosecutors said that <PERSON> Billman </PERSON> and associates `` lived like kings in palatial homes, paid for from the profit of their personal companies which continued to grow even after Community began to fail in 1985.'' The jury held <PERSON> Billman </PERSON> and his codefendants liable on six counts each of breaching their fiduciary duties _ partly in connection with more than $ 82 million in improper, unsecured loans from Community to EPIC in the early 1980s. The defendants also violated their trust by engaging in numerous insider deals and allowing themselves lavish salaries, bonuses and perquisites, the jury found. Other defendants were <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Deerin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, both members of Community's board of directors and officers of various holding companies. Also named as defendants were <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> McCuistion </PERSON> of <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Meltz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Billman </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> fingerprint clerk from rural southern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, worked for real estate firms until he founded EPIC in 1975, and eventually built it into a $ 1.5 billion real estate empire The brainchild of <PERSON> Billman </PERSON> and his former college roommate, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> McCuistion </PERSON>, EPIC acquired single-family homes and packaged them into sophisticated tax shelters for investors.

 The state attorney general is asking for ethics probes of the lawyers who advised <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> after a grand jury concluded the black teen-ager concocted her story of abduction and rape by a gang of white men. The girl's advisers _ lawyers <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> _ told her not to cooperate with the investigation on the grounds it was part of a racist criminal justice system. They also accused some public officials of participating in the alleged rape and others of covering up what happened. With Thursday's release of the 170-page grand jury report, Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> asked a judicial grievance committee and a judicial disciplinary panel to investigate <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> for possible disciplinary action, which could include suspension or disbarment. `` Their outrageous, irresponsible actions have increased the atmosphere of tensions between the races, not only in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, not only in <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but throughout the nation because of the celebrated nature of this case,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. `` Mr <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> have made every effort to prevent the criminal justice system from uncovering the truth of what happened to <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>.'' In a 10-page letter, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> detailed 19 statements he said <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> made knowing they were false. `` Is there anyone left in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who believes them?'' Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> asked Thursday evening. Although <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> did not formally recommend action against <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, he said his actions were `` deplorable, disgraceful, reprehensible, irresponsible,'' and said the activist is under investigation by his office and possibly that of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The report summarized a seven-month investigation that cost the state at least $ 620,000, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. `` We have the facts. We have solved the case. The allegations she had made are false,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. The grand jury provided no reason for Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> to lie, but its report noted that she was beaten by her mother after spending a weekend away from home in May 1986 and punished by her mother's live-in boyfriend, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, for coming home from a party at 5 a.m. shortly before her disappearance There was `` no evidence that any sexual assault occurred,'' the report said. Microscopic examination of physical evidence, including fibers from her jeans, boots and blouse, suggested that she had been in her family's former <ORGANIZATION> Wappingers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> apartment the four days she claimed she was held captive. The report said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> apparently burned a hole in her own pants, scrawled the word `` nigger'' on her shoe, smeared dog feces on her body and clothing, and stepped into a plastic garbage bag in front of the vacant apartment in the town 75 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was found Nov. 28 in the plastic bag, covered with dog feces and with `` KKK'' and `` nigger'' written on her body. She told police she was abducted and raped by six white men, one of whom showed a badge. Two officials whom the advisers accused of taking part in the attack _ Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Fishkill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ were exonerated in the report. `` I've been saying right along that I have nothing to do with <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON>, who has threatened to sue the advisers. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> killed himself shortly after Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was found, but the report said there was no evidence that the suicide had any connection with the case. The advisers stuck by their version of events. `` What should we expect from 21 whites from <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>?'' said <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, referring to 21 whites on the panel of 23. `` It is clear they never intended to arrest and prosecute those people who did this to <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> told a rally of about 200 people outside <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday night that the report contained contradictions and that Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> would give her reaction at a press conference Saturday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The Times had reported on the grand jury's findings last week Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> refused to talk to reporters Thursday as she left her new <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, home for school.

 National lawmakers have passed a bill barring Nicaraguans from accepting any assistance from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, including humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, opposition leaders assailed a new emergency law that gives President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> sweeping powers to curb civil liberties. `` The new law consolidates the dictatorial and totalitarian state, and just as in the <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> of -LRB- President Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the Nicaraguan people should say ` No' to the Sandinistas,'' said <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Chileans voted Wednesday against letting <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> extend his 15-year rule. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> party controls the Assembly and the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The anti-assistance bill, approved Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, prohibits all aid approved by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and destined for opposition groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, labor unions and individuals. Violators face between four and 12 years imprisonment under the law.

The Sandinistas and the Contras agreed March 21 to suspend offensive operations, but talks aimed at a permanent end to the 7-year-old war stand at an impasse. They have repeatedly accused each other of truce violations. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has provided more than $ 600,000 for civic opposition groups in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

The emergency powers law, approved Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, gives the president authority to declare a state of emergency for reasons of war, economic crisis or national disaster. It allows him to close news media, block mail, take over private vehicles and businesses, make preventive arrests, and close the nation's borders to individuals.

 Four Americans entered <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> today and began floating dollar bills down the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to advertise a $ 2.4 million reward for missing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen, but the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> navy scooped up most of the money. The Americans dumped the money, stamped with the reward offer and sealed in plastic envelopes, into the river after their two boats moved about 220 yards into Laotian waters. They stuffed other bills into a toy boat guided by remote control towards the Laotian shore. However, a Thai naval patrol boat waved the Americans back to the Thai side of the river and retrieved 62 of about 100 packets tossed into the river, then returned the money. `` It wo n't work. It's incredibly stupid,'' said one <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> navy officer. Two members of the American team were arrested earlier this week after entering <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. They are believed still held by Laotian authorities. The Americans are offering $ 2.4 million to any <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> or Vietnamese who brings an American out of these nations. The Americans, members of a group called <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION>, say the reward money has been pledged by 21 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen and others in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government lists 2,393 Americans as missing in action from fighting in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The three governments deny holding live Americans, and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> are helping <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> resolve the issue. The four Americans are <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beret </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> veteran of the Vietnam War; <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, of Winter Haven, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, a nurse during the war; and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a dentist from <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. Thai navy officials said their entry into Laotian waters could jeopardize Thai-Laotian relations. `` We do n't want this to become a problem between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>,'' said one official at the naval station in <LOCATION> Khong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chiam </LOCATION>. `` Entering Laotian waters will give our neighbors the impression that we endorse this activity.'' The Mekong forms a boundary between <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and flows to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Although Thai-Laotian relations are improving, a number of clashes have occurred between the two countries since the 1975 communist victory in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. The 62 packets of money were given back to the Americans, who distributed some to local children and dropped others into the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> from the Thai shore. About two dozen children leaped in to retrieve as many as they could. The mood turned festive as Ms. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> handed out ballons and reward stickers to excited youngsters. The Americans last saw their toy boat near the Laotian side of the river, which is about a half-mile wide at the spot. Two members of their group were captured by <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> authorities Sunday when they hired a fishing boat, dropped bills into the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION>, and then went on to a Laotian village. Thai police say <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Copp </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Hampstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, have been moved from the river village to <LOCATION> Pakse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and possibly the Laotian capital of <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> said it has not been informed of their whereabouts or status.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leader of the political arm of the leftist rebel movement plans to run for president during national elections in March, a leftist coalition says. Also Thursday, several hundred guerrillas attacked a southern civil defense post, killing one soldier and wounding three, the army said. A rocket grenade struck the National Assembly building but caused no injuries. The Democratic Convergence, a coalition of three small leftist parties, said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, a lawyer, would run for president and <PERSON> Reni </PERSON> <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON>, a physician, would be its vice presidential candidate. Ungo is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella organization of four guerrilla groups fighting the U.S.-backed government. The Democratic Convergence represents the left's first participation in elections since 1977. The left previously contended the civil war made fair elections impossible. Up to 400 guerrillas participated in the pre-dawn attack on the civil defense post in <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, an army sergeant said. His face was bandaged and his clothes were still covered with blood from a shrapnel wound. `` They hit us hard, but they also have dead,'' said the sergeant, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` They attacked us on all sides but we managed to fight them off.'' He said 12 men were on duty at the time of the attack, which lasted three hours. He did not elaborate on the guerrilla dead. Rebels also destroyed the local office of <LOCATION> ANTEL </LOCATION>, the state-owned telecommunications enterprise, and blew up two utility poles with transformers, causing a blackout of the surrounding area, the sergeant said. At the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, a rocket-propelled grenade struck the wall of a stairway leading to the main assembly chamber, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. Spectators were going up the stairs to view the morning session when the projectile struck, but no one was hurt, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, which knocked some stones loose and left a small hole in the wall.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has sharply denied reports that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is secretly negotiating with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said that anyone who claims to be a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to such negotiations is lying. `` Anyone who tries to cut across our policies should butt out,'' he added. His remarks were reinforced by Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, who denied categorically at a separate news conference Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had opened talks on hostages or any other subjects. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made his remarks Thursday at a news conference during his visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the fall session of the 43rd <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. He was reacting to a spate of recent reports that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is involved in secret negotiations for the release of hostages. He gave no specifics about individuals who `` nominate themselves'' as government representatives but suggested the practice is widespread. `` What's wrong is that these people forever seem to have it in their minds that some kind of deal can be struck, and they want to be negotiators. `` And we keep driving it home: There is not going to be any deal. The hostages should be released.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> responded to questions about statements in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> by former President <PERSON> Abolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said an agent of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON>, negotiated the release from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Monday of <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resident who is a citizen of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Other reports said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offered money or weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in exchange for the release of nine Americans missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Most of them are believed held hostage by pro-Iranian kidnappers. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared for talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on the Iran-Iraq war, hostages, and terrorism. But he said no direct talks have taken place. He said messages are exchanged with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through governments in contact with both countries.

<HEAD>Four Senators Seeking Safety Review Of Savannah River Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BROOKS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators are seeking an independent safety review of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> after disclosures that up to 30 major mishaps over three decades went unreported and in the wake of an equipment failure that released radioactive gas into the air. The escape Thursday of less than 0.01 millirems of tritium gas into the atmosphere posed no health threat, said plant spokeswoman <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>. A millirem is a measure of radiation; a routine chest X-ray totals about 20 millirems, according to Ms. Craft. Workers at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-owned plant, the nation's sole producer of weapons-grade plutonium and tritium, were not evacuated. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Sens. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., called Thursday for an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, which was established by Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> to give independent assessments of operations at nuclear At the state Capitol in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, 60 miles to the northeast, a dozen people held a two-hour vigil to demonstrate their concern. But in downtown <PERSON> Aiken </PERSON>, most of the customers at <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s beauty and barber shop said Thursday they were unconcerned about problems at the nearby plant `` Everybody's nonchalant who comes in the shop. They're more concerned about jobs than danger,'' he said. `` But I'm concerned. I want to know if there's any danger to the environment, what kind of danger there'd be to our health.'' `` It's been there for 30 years and nobody's died yet,'' said <PERSON> Aiken </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Odell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>. Disclosures about problems at the sprawling plant began last week, when two congressional committees were told that a number of serious reactor accidents were kept secret for 31 years. An internal <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report released Wednesday concluded that the plant's management undermines safety and deviates from `` practices common to well-run nuclear plants.'' The report also cited the undisclosed accidents. The draft report criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the plant under contract, for poor staff training, poor communications and sloppy operating procedures that it said have undermined safety. The 50-page report made a host of recommendations, including stepping up oversight so problems can be caught before they become serious. A spokesman for <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said company officials had not seen the report, but already moved to correct some of the deficiencies it cited. Weeks, who has been mayor of the town of 15,000 people for half of his 80 years, said: `` We've felt we're living in as safe a place as we can. I'm not at all concerned about the townspeople's safety. When <PERSON> Aiken </PERSON> residents talk of the plant, which they call `` SRP,'' they speak of jobs and the economic prosperity the prime employer has meant to the community of tree-lined streets and the surrounding area near <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, owner of the Four Generations gift and antique shop on the town's main plaza, said: `` The opponents to <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> are raising questions that need to be made, but there are some people who become very negative when you go against what's already there. `` They have a secure job with great benefits. People do n't question that after a while.

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The thigh-baring mini skirt is gone, but the sexy look survives on the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> runway with bare midriffs and more during this week's spring-summer 1989 Italian ready-to-wear presentations. It is true that the overall impression of the five-day showings, which ended Thursday, is calm and relaxed, with long skirts and loose pants replacing the hip-hugging, supershort items which shook the fashion world last fall. But it is also true that some of the more candid above-the-waist shots, favored by the almost all-male crew of fashion photographers, could never appear in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> paper. The boldest of these, a full-front of the tiny-breasted Icelandic model, <PERSON> Brynja </PERSON>, at the <ORGANIZATION> Gianni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Versace </ORGANIZATION> show wearing a sheer chiffon blouse with nothing underneath, was widely published in the Italian press, including the prestigious <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> daily, <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION>. But bare breasts are everyday fare in this country, where topless sunbathers lie side-by-side with picnicking families on beaches, television puts few veils on its dancers in variety shows, and family magazines display nudity on the cover. Most torsos were not as boldly bared as <PERSON> Brynja </PERSON>'s, but the nude look of the 1960s is certainly making a come back. Many designers _ including <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>; <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Varty </PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION> Byblos </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Moschino </LOCATION>; and of course hot-blooded <PERSON> Versace </PERSON>, champion of the tightest version of last year's miniskirt _ bared the flesh. Some presented bolero jackets over a nude midriff, others cut their tops so short that they did not cover the essential, and others still dipped below the waist to bare the navel, while they covered the bosom in bandeau bras. At times, the nude look passed for ethnic, as in the many outfits which drew inspiration from the tropics. At others, it was less innocent, as in the Ferre and Versace evening wear, where it was very definitely intended for disco drama. The bared midriff is sure to offer consolation to the male population, which judging from the comments heard off the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> runway, are bemoaning the demise of short skirts for next year's warmer weather However, whether women will be as easily seduced by the new look remains to be seen.

 Here are excerpts from the grand jury report on the <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case: _ `` Based upon all the evidence that has been presented to the grand jury, we conclude that <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was not the victim of a forcible sexual assault by multiple assailants over a four-day period. There is no evidence that any sexual assault occurred.'' _ `` The grand jury further concludes there is nothing in regard to <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s appearance on Nov. 28 that is inconsistent with this condition having been self-inflicted.'' _ `` There is no evidence that a cover-up occurred or was attempted in this case.'' _ `` Based upon our investigation, the grand jury has found no legally sufficient evidence to charge any person with a crime or to establish that a crime occurred.'' _ `` There may be questions that some think should be answered that are not dealt with by this report. The grand jury, however, may not go beyond the limitations imposed upon it by law. We believe that we have answered all those questions that we were lawfully permitted to address.'' _ `` At some point between Tuesday evening, Nov. 24, and the time she was found on Saturday, Nov. 28, <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> had significant contact with and spent a period of undetermined duration in Apartment 19A -LRB- the former <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> family apartment in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, outside of which she was found -RRB-. _ `` All the items and instrumentalities necessary to create the condition in which <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> appeared on Saturday, Nov. 28, were present inside of or in the immediate vicinity of Apartment 19A. ... The razor blade found inside Apartment 19A is consistent with the instrument used to cut the word `` NIGGER'' into the side of Ms. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s pink shoe and to cut open the white boots. There was no blood found inside the shoe and we conclude that the shoe could not have been worn when cut. ... The feces found on the pink blouse and shoe Ms. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was wearing when found, -LRB- and -RRB- on the gloves found in the bag in which she was discovered ... contained dog hairs which were consistent with the hairs from a dog owned by the occupant of Apartment 21A.'' _ `` There is no medical or forensic evidence that a sexual assault was committed on <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>. If a 15-year-old girl has been forcibly raped or sodomized by multiple assailants over a four-day period, there is a high probability that medical or forensic evidence would have been found.'' _ `` When discovered, <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was not suffering from exposure. If an individual had been outdoors continuously from Tuesday evening, Nov. 24, to Saturday afternoon, Nov. 28, when the temperature several times dropped to the freezing point, there is a high probability the individual would have suffered from exposure. ... When discovered, <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was not malnourished. ...''

A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recovery team arrived at the crash site Wednesday and will remain there until all the remains are recovered, <PERSON> Malensk </PERSON> said. `` There's not much left,'' a <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION> official said. `` It obviously nose-dived into the side of a hill. Only the tail is sticking out of the ground. In all probability the rest was covered by later landslides.'' <PERSON> Malensek </PERSON> said in his report that the plane was probably shot down by Japanese Zero fighters on Feb. 7, 1943. He said it was one of three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> transport planes that had taken off from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s Field in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moresby </LOCATION> and was probably carrying foodstuffs and supplies. The other two planes survived and reported the crash. The National Museum in <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moresby </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that the plane had been shot down while the Battle of <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION> was in its last stages with the Japanese being pushed back over the mountains to <LOCATION> Salamaua </LOCATION>. He said the file on the plane was closed in 1949 with the five men classified as missing, presumed dead.

 Share prices rebounded on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar inched up against the Japanese yen. The dollar closed at 133.50 yen, up 0.20 yen from Thursday's close of 133.30 yen Opening slightly higher at 133.62 yen, the currency moved in a tight range of 133.45-133 .63 yen, with spot trading reaching $ 2.73 billion The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finally rebounded by regaining 85.93 points or 0.32 percent to finish trading at 27,258.27. It was the first time the index rose since Oct. 1, after falling for five straight days. Although share prices lost 22.79 points to move to 27,149.55 shortly after the market opened and fell lower afterwards, the market reversed the trend in the middle of the afternoon session. `` The morning session opened majorly affected by the pessimistic mood following Thursday's loss,'' said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, adding, `` but the trend changed as high-tech issues recovered.'' When the index hit the 26,000 level, investors began buying in order to make profits, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` But trading was thin in a wait-and-see mood ahead of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figure later tonight and a three-day holiday,'' the dealer added. Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 500 million shares. On the foreign exchange, `` the dollar-yen rate was hardly moving,'' said a dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, who also spoke anonymously. `` Trading was thin, and the spot trading was almost half of what the market normally trades,'' he said. `` It might have happened regardless of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate and the three-day holiday, but somehow the rate has been fluctuating,'' he added.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ About 800 street cleaners and garbage collectors demonstrated in front of City Hall to protest their firings by newly-appointed Mayor <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Christophe </PERSON>, Radio Haiti-Inter reported. Other municipal employees joined the demonstrators Thursday and went on strike, saying the mayor had no right to fire poor people and was incompetent, the radio said. Ms. <PERSON> Christophe </PERSON> accused the garbage-truck drivers of being followers of ousted Mayor <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>, who is reputed to be a leader of the dreaded <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, the feared henchmen of the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime. <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> is suspected of being a mastermind of the Sept. 11 attack on the St. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> church that left 12 dead and more than 70 wounded. Rank-and-file soldiers named the massacre at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> as one of the reasons for the Sept. 17 revolt in which they overthrew Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, now in exile, was replaced by Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. The flamboyant Ms. <PERSON> Christophe </PERSON>, a money-lender and owner of a chain of lottery shops, was named to replace <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> by the rank-and-file soldiers who engineered the coup. She accused the garbage collectors Thursday of having stolen 6,000 gallons of gasoline and 50 of the city's 56 garbage trucks, and of switching old tires for new ones and selling them. In another incident Thursday, several hundred demonstrators briefly blocked traffic on the highway between the capital and the International Airport. The demonstrators were protesting their expulsion Tuesday from what they claim to be state-owned lands abandoned by dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> when he was ousted in February 1986. One person was killed and three wounded when soldiers from the Presidential Guard expelled the squatters. Radio <PERSON> Soleil </PERSON> said five soldiers were seen among the demonstrators, apparently expressing solidarity with the protest. Also Thursday, troops dispersed several dozen people in <LOCATION> Port-de-Daix </LOCATION>, a northern port town, who demonstrated against allegedly incompetent government officials, <PERSON> Haiti-Inter </PERSON> said.

 Communist party leaders in a troubled province were ousted after thousands of protesters stormed their headquarters in the worst violence in three months of ethnic unrest. The shake-up boosted <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s drive for greater control over two provinces. At lest 100 people were injured Thursday when an estimated 30,000 people in <LOCATION> Novi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sad </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> province, surged toward riot police guarding party headquarters, state-run media said. The demonstrators threw rocks and broke about 20 windows during the 30-hour siege. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said two firecrackers caused a fire that was quickly extinguished. Fourteen policemen were among the injured, two seriously, it said. Six people were hospitalized and four were reported arrested before the crowds were dispersed. The 15 members of the Communist party's Politburo in <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> province pledged to step down after the demonstration. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported later Thursday that the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in the province voted 87-10 to dismiss the Politburo, the region's highest political body. The mass resignation in <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> is a major victory for <ORGANIZATION> Serbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who has led his republic's Serbian drive for more control over <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and a second province, ethnically troubled <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. The Communist party leaderships in both provinces had resisted the Serbian drive for more control. The <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> leadership is now expected to come under pressure to step down. The shake-up came two days after national Communist party chief <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, faced with the mounting unrest, promised sweeping personnel changes in the ruling national Politburo and policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at or before a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting scheduled for Oct. 17. <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> provincial leaders had promised to resign after meeting with Serbian party leaders in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the nation's capital 40 miles to the south <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> quoted the <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> party as saying: `` The <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> leadership has been deaf to the demands of the working class and other citizens. A serious split has occurred between the <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> leadership and the people.'' Provincial party leader <PERSON> Milovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sogorov </PERSON> said a 10-member provisional group would be established while new leaders were chosen for <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, a flat region that produces most of the nation's grain. Tens of thousands of Serbs have rallied almost daily for three months in support of <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s effort to assert more authority in the provinces. Most demonstrations have supported the cause of Serbs in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. A largely <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> minority, they claim harassment by predominantly Moslem ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s 2 million people. The southern province borders on <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. The latest protesters sang Serbian nationalist songs but also shouted complaints about low wages and declining standards of living. State television said an informal poll it conducted of demonstrators in <LOCATION> Novi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sad </LOCATION> showed that most cited the bad economic situation as the main reason for demanding change. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> rejected a call Thursday from former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Nikola </PERSON> <PERSON> Ljubicic </PERSON>, who is a member of the nation's collective presidency, for unspecified emergency measures to quell the street protests. The Serbian leader's opponents suspect he is using the mass rallies to gain more national power for himself and for <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the largest of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics. Many Serbs see <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> as political heir to the late President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, who died in 1980 and left the nation with a complex system of annual rotation in the occupants of top political offices. The arrangement has prevented any one republic from gaining dominance, but it has not provided the strong leadership needed to deal effectively with ethnic and economic problems. Strikes and worker protests have become commonplace because of 217 percent annual inflation, 15 percent unemployment and austerity plans imposed to try to repay a $ 21 billion foreign debt. The failure of the federal Communist government, led by Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>, to cope with the economic crisis triggered an attempt to unseat him in May with a parliamentary vote of no-confidence. Mikulic staved off the effort with support from <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> deputies.

<HEAD>Deaths Of Two Children On Same Day Prompt Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two suburban <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> children were killed by automatic garage doors in separate accidents the same day, and authorities say the devices probably did not meet current safety standards due to their age. `` We're interested in finding out who manufactured those devices, who installed them and how they were maintained,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Donath </PERSON>, an investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Both victims, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Abigael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, 9, were asphyxiated by pressure of the doors against their chests, according to autopsy reports. Both died Wednesday before relatives discovered them. Officials believe the children were operating the devices by themselves when they were caught by the closing doors. Both devices were at least 10 years old, officials said. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> apparently was knocked off his bicycle by the door on his parents' garage and pinned to the ground. The door caught him on his chin, said Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunzer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Roseville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Abigael </PERSON> was probably running out to meet her 5-year-old sister, <PERSON> Molly </PERSON>, at a bus stop, authorities said. <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> found her sister pinned under the garage door of their Eden Prairie home. Federal authorities have documented 32 garage-door deaths of children under age 12 since voluntary safety standards for the automatic openers were last upgraded in 1982, <PERSON> Donath </PERSON> said. The last known garage-door death occurred in 1980. `` A lot of the early -LRB- models -RRB- with the reversible feature never did work properly,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Door </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maplewood </LOCATION>. He recommended that homeowners test their automatic garage doors simply by trying to stop them by hand. If one does not stop or reverse, he recommended installing a new unit.

<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new state law requiring unmarried minors to obtain parental consent for abortions was put on hold by a federal judge who ruled that the measure fell `` woefully short'' of constitutional requirements. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the preliminary injunction he issued Thursday would stand until `` further order of the court.'' It prevents Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> and state attorneys from enforcing the law, which requires unmarried teens under 18 to seek the consent of a parent, custodian or legal guardian before obtaining an abortion. If parents refused to give consent, a pregnant teen-ager could appeal to a judge, who would decide if the girl was mature enough to make the decision and whether an abortion was in her best interest. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s ruling `` means that the young women of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> can do what they want with their bodies and exercise their constitutional right to have an abortion,'' said attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>, who represented a women's clinic and three physicians who challenged the law. <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, called the ruling `` a wonderful victory.'' `` The state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> was particularly thoughtless in passing that bill, and they responded to the anti-choice people without really considering what it really meant to the women of this state,'' she said. But <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> anti-abortion lobbyist, said, `` Even parents who are adamantly pro-abortion want to be involved with their minor daughter's decision.'' She said she expects the injunction to be overturned. The order followed arguments in a 90-minute hearing Wednesday that the law unconstitutionally restricts access to abortion for pregnant girls under 18. <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> argued that `` the statute unduly burdens a minor's right to abortion by failing to adequately prescribe procedures for ensuring the confidentiality and anonymity of minors, and that it fails to establish sufficient guidelines for an expeditious appeal of a <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Waas </PERSON> argued the law is constitutional and said legislation is not required to address `` all variables in the vast expanse of human experience.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> pointed out that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion and that the right had been extended to minors. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said said the law, `` when measured against <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> precedent ... falls woefully short of constitutional requirements.''

<HEAD>Aerial Spraying Begins Three-Part Attack Against Medfly
Infestation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Overnight aerial spraying to kill a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> fruit fly infestation left much of the city's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> looking like <PERSON> Christo </PERSON> artwork, as residents wrapped cars, playground equipment and other belongings in plastic. Pesticide-laden helicopters criss-crossed a 35-square-mile area until early today in the first step of an all-out attack against the Medfly, an agricultural pest that destroys about 250 varieties of produce. The insecticide Malathion poses no health risk, agriculture officials said, but they warned residents that the sticky corn syrup in which it was mixed to attract the flies could damage a car's paint. The alert prompted a run on tarpaulins and plastic wrap at stores throughout the area. `` People say a lot of chain stores are out of the stuff,'' said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hardware </LOCATION>. The effect of the protective measures was especially striking at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Art </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>, where outdoor sculptures swathed in black plastic and tape recalled fences and bridges transformed into artworks through similar wrapping by <PERSON> Christo </PERSON>, the Bulgarian-born artist. The spraying was ordered because 47 Medflies were found in the Palms area since Sept. 26, agricultural officials said. But aerial spraying was only the first step in the three-part attack against the pest, said <PERSON> Gera </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. A quarantine against transporting fruit and vegetables from the area is expected to go into effect today or Monday, she said. The final step will be the release of millions of sterile Medflies later this month so that the wild Medflies that survived the spraying will, in effect, breed themselves out of existence. Although agricultural production in the urbanized area is slight, officials termed the infestation serious, saying it would threaten the state's $ 15.5 billion-a-year farm economy if allowed to spread. Along with parts of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, the helicopters sprayed sections of west <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the adjacent municipalities of <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. About 100,000 people live in the sprayed area, which includes middle-class homes and apartments, multimillion-dollar mansions, swank shops and luxury car dealerships. For much of the day, Ms. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said, worried residents flooded hot lines set up by agriculture officials with questions about the spraying. At <ORGANIZATION> Paulee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Body </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION>, president <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleiner </PERSON> assigned four employees to cover more than 180 mostly high-priced automobiles parked outdoors. <PERSON> Fleiner </PERSON> said he spent about $ 500 on plastic and $ 200 on masking tape for the job, which took hours. At <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a caravan of about 100 shiny Caddies left the sales lot Wednesday night for an underground parking lot at a bank building six blocks away, sales manager <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Thursday.

<HEAD>Report Links Military to Human Rights Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two American human rights groups claimed today that Filipino soldiers may be linked to the killings of five human rights lawyers and the harassment of a dozen others since last year. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, both New York-based groups, claimed President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government `` has failed to respond adequately'' to attacks on human rights lawyers and that victims of abuses were afraid to seek legal redress. The 28-page report cited the unsolved killings of five human rights lawyers, who were slain in separate incidents from October 1987 until last June. It said evidence existed that the military or military-backed anti-Communist vigilante groups may have been involved in the killings. The report by the two groups said more than a dozen other lawyers have been subjected to threats, harassment and surveillance since 1987. It urged the Aquino government to `` publicly and unambiguously express its commitment to the protection of human rights lawyers and its condemnation of the killings, threats and harassment.'' `` Victims of abuses are often afraid to pursue legal redress,'' said the report, written by <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsen </PERSON>, professor of law at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Strossen </PERSON>, visiting professor of law at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` Those who do, often discover that those responsible are shielded from prosecution by the local military detachment,'' the report said. There was no comment from the government on the charges. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has vowed to curb human rights abuses. But last month, she said it was unfair to blame the entire military establishment for abuses by a few of its members. The report was released two days after the London-based <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> human rights organization claimed more than 100 leftists, trade unionists and social activists were slain in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> last year because of alleged links to Communist rebels. Human rights groups here claim such abuses are continuing despite Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s pledge to protect civil liberties after the 1986 ouster of President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. During a human rights seminar here Thursday, military officials and civil rights workers clashed over the government's plans to deploy a new civilian militia, the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, to help battle the rebels. Undersecretary of Defense <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ermita </PERSON> said the 160,000-member armed forces alone could not contend with the 25,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, Moslem insurgents and right-wing extremists. He said members of the new force would be carefully screened and would face court-martial for any human rights abuses. But <PERSON> Mariss </PERSON> <PERSON> Diokno </PERSON>, a prominent human rights activist, said the new force was `` anti-democratic'' and a step toward militarization that social activists hoped would be reversed following <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' ouster

 Foreign nations are shunning <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s three-week-old military government that has cracked down on a popular uprising for democracy, diplomats said today The main official contacts have involved notes from several foreign embassies decrying the bloodshed since Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power in a coup. The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no nation has sent the standard message of congratulations to the new leader, which would signify recognition of his government. Diplomats also said <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who also serves as the new foreign minister, has met no heads of foreign missions. Ambassadors of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last month presented protest notes citing the killing of unarmed civilians by troops. Other countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have expressed concern from their capitals. Meanwhile, state radio reported Thursday that two more opposition groups have registered with the government, bringing to seven the number of opposition parties that have surfaced since <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power. The newest parties to register with the election commission were the <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by former communist rebel <PERSON> Thakin </PERSON> <PERSON> Soe </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Fascist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, headed by onetime member of parliament <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kya </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyunt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thakin </PERSON> <PERSON> Soe </PERSON>, 80, once led the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> rebels who followed a radical, Trotskyite program but were defeated by the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> military in the 1960s. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which registered earlier, also is headed by a former communist figure. The new military government, which seized power in Sept. 18, crushed pro-democracy demonstrations but announced that multi-party elections would be held in about three months. Although seven parties have registered with the commission, none have stated clearly whether they would take part in the elections, which also will be contested by the government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Diplomats and other analysts are skeptical that fair elections can be held given a hardline government that has been willing to shoot thousands of unarmed demonstrators to stay in power. By official count, about 440 people have been killed since the military coup. Western diplomats here believe the death toll is much higher. Other anti-government groups are the <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youths </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. The patron of an eighth anti-government group _ the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> _ is Nu, the former prime minister overthrown by strongman Ne Win in 1962. Western diplomats say they are convinced the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is fully supported by <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and his military government, but that the new leaders want their actions to appear legal so as to subdue strong anti-government feelings among the public. Since last fall, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has been wracked by bloody protests and a deteriorating economy. Demonstrators have called for the end of authoritarian rule and a liberalized economy to pull one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s most resource-rich nations out of poverty <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have temporarily frozen aid to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> but have refrained from direct interference in the domestic turmoil. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced today <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would provide <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> with $ 450,000 in emergency food aid through <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> because of serious shortages. But Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> stressed at a news conference that `` This does n't mean we approve of <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s military government.''

<TEXT>
 Radical students calling for the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo hurled hundreds of firebombs and rocks at riot police today during a violent demonstration at a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> college. In another demonstration in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, about 300 students clashed with riot troopers and 12 troopers were injured, the <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Police reported no arrests or serious injuries during the 90-minute clash in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, the largest in the capital in recent weeks. Some 2,000 students from about 30 colleges took part in the rally on the outskirts of southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to denounce the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> administration and call for the expulsion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` Down with the fascist regime which suppresses the masses,'' the students chanted. `` Yankee go home.'' The leaders charged that the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> administration was a front for military rule and insisted there had been no democratic reforms in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general who won presidential elections in December, has helped introduce broad democratic reforms since taking power. He has pledged to end authoritarian rule and make <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> a full democracy. The students marched out of the school and clashed on the highway outside with hundreds of riot police. Police armored vans with multiple tear gas launchers fired barrages of tear gas canisters. The two-hour riot in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> took place at the <ORGANIZATION> Chonam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> reported. The South Korean agency said the 12 troopers were injured by firebombs and rocks. The radicals have virtually no public support and their following on campuses has dwindled sharply in recent months. They staged a few protests during the Olympic Games which ended Sunday, but generally were quiet.

 Five nuns remained barricaded today in their monastery, fighting a church relocation order prompted by their objection to the introduction of such modern amenities as television and music systems. Fearing they would be evicted from the monastery because their conservative views clashed with the new wave of liberalization, four nuns locked themselves in the infirmary of the Monastery of the Most Blessed <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of Mt. <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> on Tuesday. A fifth nun joined them Wednesday. The nuns are members of the Order of Discalced Carmelites. They say the first intrusion began just over a year ago when a new prioress brought in a television set. Other trappings of the outside world slowly found their way behind the white walls of the monastery: music systems, sweets and a modern lighting system in the chapel. `` It just became a gradual breakdown -LRB- of traditions -RRB-,'' said Sister <PERSON> John </PERSON> of the Cross. `` These sisters are keeping a vigil, they are not protesting,'' <PERSON> Doreen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ercolano </PERSON>, the sibling of one of the nuns, Sister <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, said Thursday. `` They are fearful that if they leave the infirmary they'll be physically forced from the monastery.'' Sister <PERSON> Eliane </PERSON>, who has been at the monastery the longest time among the 13 nuns, said the dispute is a `` conservative-liberal issue.'' `` They do not agree with some changes made here,'' she said. `` They are scared to death.'' <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paterson </ORGANIZATION>, said there are no plans to physically evict the nuns, but the church will try to talk them into ending the protest. The conservative nuns say the diocese threatened to evict them from the monastery because of their adherence to their religious order. `` We were told we are too strict,'' Sister <PERSON> John </PERSON> said Thursday in a telephone interview from the monastery's locked infirmary. `` We were always encouraged to be conservative. But in the last year every aspect of our lives has changed.'' The Carmelite order was founded in 1562 by <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Its followers try to remove all intrusions of modern life and dedicate themselves to contemplation and prayer. Although there is no vow of silence, the order is expected to keep speech to a minimum. The Monastery of the Most Blessed <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of Mt. <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> was built in 1926 when this community 30 miles west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was remote and rural. Today, the Spanish architecture stands in contrast to a suburban backdrop of gleaming office buildings and service stations. The dispute began with the arrival of a new prioress, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, who brought television, music and other modern conveniences to the monastery, angering the more conservative nuns who complained to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> refused comment Thursday. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did not return telephone calls. The church had tried to settle the matter by offering to move the more conservative Carmelite nuns to another monastery. But the conservative nuns refused to move.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> visited one of the country's most historic shrines today to decide whether to allow an American firm continue a controversial treasure hunt there. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters she was `` very pleased'' with the restoration of chambers unearthed by nearly a year of digging at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, a 16th Century Spanish fortress used by Japanese troops as a concentration camp for American and Filipino prisoners during World War II. She added that she and her staff need more time to determine whether to renew for a third time the digging permit given the firm <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev </LOCATION>. The firm's head, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McDougal </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s chief security adviser, insist that tons of gold bullion are buried beneath the fort. They claim core drillings have yielded gold particles. The digging has been dogged by controversy since shortly after it began secretly in November. The treasure hunt became public in February when two Filipino workers were killed in a cave-in. Last month, the government's anti-graft prosecutor accused <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON> of accepting payments from the company. <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON> admitted he deposited a total $ 110,000 of company funds in his personal bank account but claimed it was simply entrusted to him pending a company reorganization. <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON> said the funds included $ 40,000 as a guarantee against damages to the fort, built by Spanish colonialists at the mouth of the <LOCATION> Pasig </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to defend the city. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> served as prison to <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizal </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>'s national hero who was executed in 1896, and was converted into a concentration camp and torture center by Japanese soldiers during World War II <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON> and <PERSON> McDougal </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> they had maps and at least two witnesses who have showed them the places where the Japanese imperial army officers buried tons of gold, silver, diamonds and other treasures plundered by the Japanese from all over <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Asked by reporters if she was going to renew the permit to dig, which expired on Sept. 1, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> replied she was more interested in the restoration work on the newly unearthed portions of the fort. `` We have not given any extension of the permit yet,'' she added. `` We are still evaluating all of the different reports that we have been getting ... so that we can evaluate later on whether we will grant an extension or not.''

<HEAD>Editorial Reactions on Bentsen-Quayle Debate</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Following is a roundup of editorial reaction to the vice presidential debate from newspapers around the country:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> accomplished three tasks with the most memorable line of Wednesday night's vice-presidential debate, when he told <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, ` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.' With that remark, he helped establish himself as by far the better of the two candidates _ and in a close presidential election, he may have given many <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> as good a reason as they need to come back to the fold next month.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` If -LRB- <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> -RRB- had only one decent answer to the question he faced at least three times _ the one about what he would do if a tragedy thrust him into the presidency _ we would have been more reassured. But obviously he either had n't anticipated the question or did n't want to answer it. ... `` He would say a prayer for himself and the country. Good. He would call together the Cabinet. Good. But then what? Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> prefered to talk about his qualifications rather than give us a clue that he had a thoughtful plan in mind.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Star Tribune (Minneapolis)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` The ` debate' seemed to confirm the awfulness of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to choose <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as running mate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice looked better; -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was more polished, more experienced, more adept at ripostes like his now-famous slashing of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s self-comparison with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> But the erratic proceedings Wednesday night offered little basis for solid comparison. It was an opportunity wasted.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Atlanta Constitution</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` Nothing in Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance provided reassurance that he is ready to stand on the verge of the presidency or that Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acted with then-unrecognized wisdom in selecting him. ... `` Mr. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> _ no surprise _ was the cooler, cannier head, in part simply because of his greater experience.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Arkansas Gazette (Little Rock)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` Quayle, in our view, was mechanical in his responses to the panel's questions, reverting on several occasions to the same phraseology about his qualifications regardless of the question asked _ a reflection of briefings and rehearsals. ... `` <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> presented a mature and thoughtful figure, drawing a sharp contrast with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on relative leadership qualities and experience. Relative ages may have been a factor, perhaps depending upon the viewer's generation, but <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s broader experience clearly testified to his benefit.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` Wednesday's vice presidential debate wo n't be remembered for exchanges about Social Security, farm subsidies or foreign policy. `` The debate turned on one question: is <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> qualified to be president should anything happen to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>? Three times, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s junior senator was asked how he would handle such a crisis. Three times, he faltered.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Dallas Times Herald:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stood up fairly well to some tough, maybe even unfair questioning. He did not fall on his face, as some pundits had expected, but he never gave a satisfactory answer to three questions about what he would do first if he became president. But at the same time, Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> proved that he not only is a knowledgeable, articulate officeholder who has a solid record of achievement, but that he can be awfully tough in the clutch.''

 Tests on a home that had radon levels about 800 times higher than the federal safety standard have failed to convince some neighbors that the colorless, odorless gas could kill them, officials said. The test last week on an unidentified home may be the highest radon levels ever measured in a structure. `` We believe it's the highest that anyone's ever found,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Daggett </PERSON>, acting commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>. Officials said that 59 of the 74 other nearby homes in the rural community about 40 miles west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> also showed unsafe radon levels. Many homes that have registered high radon readings sit above the Reading Prong, a belt of uranium that stretches from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> across northeastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The federal standard for structures is 4 picocuries, a unit of measurement for radioactivity. Federal officials say exposure to high levels of the naturally occurring gas may cause up to 20,000 lung cancer deaths a year _ essentially all those not caused from smoking. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuys </PERSON>, an investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> Hunterdon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spent the weekend knocking on doors in the sprawling development, urging residents to place charcoal-filled canisters in their basements for testing. He said he met with some distrustful and suspicious residents _ and several slammed doors. Some were only convinced of the urgency because it was important enough to get a government employee working on a Saturday. When a sampling of residents were told Thursday of the state's findings, some said they did n't know much about radon, some said they did n't care much, and some said they did n't care to talk about the levels found in their homes Others said they have had their homes tested or are awaiting test results. Officials said that although a radon test only costs about $ 10, and a high level is easily cured with a ventilation system for about $ 1,200, apathy is the biggest challenge in fighting the health problem. They also say that many residents may ignore warnings because they have grown immune to the constant stream of warnings about environmental problems. The announcement about the <LOCATION> Clinton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> home comes about two years after state officials discovered 105 houses with elevated radon levels in a nearby development. <PERSON> Daggett </PERSON> said the barrage of testing here began after a homeowner did a routine radon test and found a reading of about 200 picocuries. The department confirmed the results and began testing other homes. <PERSON> Daggett </PERSON> said the home with the highest reading registered more than 3,000 picocuries. The federal safety standard of 4 picocuries is the equivalent of smoking one-half pack of cigarettes a day, or having 200 to 300 chest X-rays per year. It also is the concentration that would increase the chance of getting lung cancer by 1 percent for a lifetime resident.

 Federal health officials have reported the first case of AIDS acquired from a transplant operation, but researchers stressed that the operation was four years ago _ before the advent of AIDS testing. Transplant patients have previously been infected with the virus that causes AIDS, but Thursday's report from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> marked the first time AIDS virus has been associated with a bone transplant, and the first case ever reported in which any kind of transplant has resulted in AIDS itself. `` This is consistent with how we have found the virus to be transmitted previously _ in blood, bodily fluids and body parts from another individual. ... It's an expected mode of transmission,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, an AIDS specialist with the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> noted that the surgery in question took place before the advent of antibody testing for AIDS; the donor was an intravenous drug user infected with AIDS. `` It's important for the lay public to understand that this case occurred in 1984. ... The donor could not be screened,'' he said. Since then, AIDS tests have become available, and the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has recommended that all donors of tissue or organs be tested for AIDS infection. This first AIDS-transplant case occurred in a woman with progressive spinal disease who, in November 1984, underwent a spinal fusion using bone from her hospital's bone bank. In February 1988, she was diagnosed with AIDS. She was a health care worker, but there were no indications she had contracted an AIDS infection on the job, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported. The donor from whom the bone came, a 52-year-old man who had undergone a partial hip bone removal, turned out to be an intravenous drug user, and thus at high risk for AIDS. He was diagnosed with AIDS less than two years after the woman's surgery and died in 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s parent agency, recommended Thursday that living donors of bone be tested for AIDS at the time the bone is removed, and then again 90 days later to ensure that any AIDS infection is detected. More than 74,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with more than 42,000 deaths so far, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. Some 24 cases of AIDS virus transmission through transplants have been reported worldwide, in cases such as kidney, liver and heart transplants, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. None of those patients has been diagnosed with AIDS itself, but `` undoubtedly, some will develop AIDS in the future,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, campaigning for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a key campaign battleground state, told <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> high school students today that this year's election is `` a referendum on liberalism in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' In a speech prepared for students and citizens of suburban <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged every eligible voter to take part in the Nov. 8 election. `` <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> has voted twice for what we stand for,'' he said. `` But the liberals are now saying that, come January, they will wipe away all that we have beeen working for.'' `` From top to bottom, the election this year is a referendum on liberalism,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s best-known campaign surrogate. `` Will not only the White House but the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the state legislatures be filled with people whose only Pledge of Allegiance is to more government spending?'' he asked. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to hammer away at the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> theme of `` peace and prosperity'' at a school named for the late <PERSON> Adlai </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, a prominent Democrat and two-time presidential campaign loser. The trip was part of a series <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is making as he seeks to lure `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats'' and independent voters to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s side in the vice president's race against <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. It also was a homecoming of sorts, since it was in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in July 1980 accepted his party's nomination for the first time to be its presidential candidate _ and chose <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be his running mate Most experts rate <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> a tossup between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> felt so strongly about carrying the state during his re-election campaign in 1984 that he appeared twice in the last week of the campaign. The president's last appearance in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was in September 1986, when he campaigned for <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a Republican who failed in his bid to become governor of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also was speaking at a luncheon hosted by the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> in the northeastern <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. His appearance there comes just a week after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit to <ORGANIZATION> Macomb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Political experts in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> say both stops are part of an organized effort to win over that area's blue-collar Democrats who crossed party lines to support the president in 1980 and 1984 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in recent weeks has been fond of telling campaign audiences that Democrats abandoned the so-called `` misery index'' when that party found that inflation and interest rates had declined during his administration. While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seeks to help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> broaden his electoral appeal to conservative Democrats and people who do not describe themselves as either Democrats or Republicans, the president has been raising millions of dollars for state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign coffers. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was sure to repeat this act with tonight's appearance at a $ 1,000-a-plate fund-raiser for the state party and in honor of <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, a prominent Detroit-area <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> supporter.

 Two public opinion polls published today showed a tie between the dovish <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, and the two rivals swapped accusations in a series of television advertisements. Results of those questioned in the two polls showed Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would win 42 seats each in the 120-member parliament if the Nov. 1 election were held today. The results were published in the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. The 1984 elections ended in a stalemate with neither of the major political blocs able to form a coalition. The result was shared rule in a national unity government with Labor leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> each serving two years as premier. The Likud-sponsored Dahaf poll predicted <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and its right-wing allies would win 60 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, while Labor and the left secured an equal number. The Labor-sponsored Decima poll said Labor and the leftist lists would gain a narrow majority of 61 seats. The Dahaf poll questioned 662 voters, and the <ORGANIZATION> Decima </ORGANIZATION> poll encompassed 1,000 voters. The paper did not disclose the margin of error given, and the offices of both pollsters were closed for the Jewish Sabbath. Also today, American-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> appealed to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> requesting it overturn a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decision to disqualify his anti-Arab party from running in the elections The parliamentary committee barred <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s Kach Party from participating in the elections, saying its platform calling for all Arabs to be expelled from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is racist. A new law bars racist parties from running for government. In a third day of televised ads that will continue nightly until the Nov. 1 vote, the barbed repartee between <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> came as close to a televised debate as the campaign has seen so far. `` No one in this country is against peace,'' said <PERSON> Benyamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador and a rising star in <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. `` But what <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> wants is peace through retreat -LRB- from the occupied territories -RRB-.'' He was referring to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' willingness to talk peace with the Palestinians, even though <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> refuses to negotiate with the banned <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Immediately after the Likud segment ended, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON> <PERSON> Zvili </PERSON> appeared on the screen. `` So, you're scared, huh? They scared the heck out of us, did n't they,'' <PERSON> Zvili </PERSON> said `` That's the Likud system: frightening people, making personal attacks, and frightening again.'' Labor has outlined the `` generals' peace plan'' it is pushing, so-called because it was developed with the help of high-ranking officers in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s reserve army. The plan calls for withdrawing from certain undefined areas of the occupied territories, but demanding those territories remain demilitarized in order to guarantee safe borders. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> expanded its borders in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war when it captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has pledged never to return to the pre-1967 borders. The nearly 10-month-old Palestinian revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule is the top issue in the tight election campaign. More than 280 Arabs and six Israelis have been killed in the violence, which erupted Dec. 8. Both parties oppose creation of an independent Palestinian state.

<HEAD>Planned Oliver North Lecture Sparks Controversy at Boston College</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students are circulating a petition opposing a student government decision to pay retired Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> $ 25,000 to lecture there, saying he is n't worth it. Those behind the petition say the fee is too high and <PERSON> North </PERSON> will not trigger discussion worth the price. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuley </PERSON>, executive vice president of the student government board, defended the selection, calling North one of the most popular figures of the decade. He said the 90-minute lecture Nov. 2 will attract a broad range of students. `` Overall, this is a great opportunity to listen to a man responsible for one of the great shake-ups in our government's history,'' <PERSON> McAuley </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, the independent student weekly newspaper at the university, said, `` It does n't seem like they -LRB- the student board -RRB- took the opposition to heart. I think they brought him because he would be controversial and would draw a lot of people. But they may lose more people than they draw.'' She wrote an editorial against the choice and said a group of students is gathering signatures to try to block <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s appearance. `` For $ 18,000, I was told, we could have had <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, and he's a former president,'' she said. `` I do n't think we can learn that much from <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>.'' North faces trial on 16 charges of conspiracy to defraud the government in the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages plan. He has given more than 25 speeches in the past year to raise money for his defense. Last year, former Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> lectured at the college for a combined charge of less than $ 30,000, said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON>, director of communications for the college. The money for the appearance comes from a student activities fund created through a mandatory student assessment fee, <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> said. He said that in the past the fund had been used for several lectures, but this year the board voted to spend most of it for North's appearance.

 After years of public protests, the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> legislature has agreed to make Lithuanian the Baltic republic's official language and to permit display of religious symbols, an activist reported today The decision prompted an estimated 100,000 Lithuanians, mostly Roman Catholics, to gather in their capital, <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, this morning to celebrate with nationalist songs, flag-waving and dancing, said activist <PERSON> Vytautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogusis </PERSON>. Also today, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, reported that the legislature of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, another <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, was drafting a bill to make Latvian the republic's official language. Similar measures were adopted earlier in the third <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, in response to a campaign by nationalists. <PERSON> Bogusis </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, a group demanding an end to Soviet control over their republic, said local newspapers today reprinted decrees of the Presidium, or executive committee of the legislature. One measure allows display of religious symbols, and another designates Lithuanian the republic's official language Many Baltic activists complain that top officials in their republics do not know the indigenous languages and that Russian and other tongues are contaminating their language. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also reported adoption of Lithuanian as the official language and said <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> flags could now be displayed at gatherings, sporting events, song and dance festivals. The dispatch did not say whether the flag was the one that flew in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> before it was incorporated into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, or whether it was the flag of Soviet <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. Lithuanians in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said they believed the order applies to the independence flag, which had been banned. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> took over <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> in 1940 under a secret pact with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

Many people singing the nationalist songs and dancing also carried the flag, he said. Police, who earlier would have torn down the flag and arrested nationalist demonstrators, did not interfere, <PERSON> Bogusis </PERSON> said.

 The release of an Indian hostage prompted a flurry of reports today about a secret U.S.-Iran deal to free more captives and about the imminent release of a British hostage. But Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has denied reports that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is negotiating with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to release hostages and said that `` anyone who tries to cut across our policies should butt out.'' Lebanese kidnappers warned on Thursday that two American hostages may be in danger if <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops are sent to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to oversee presidential elections. Sixteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Most are believed held by Shiite Moslem extremists backed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. On Monday, the Islamic Jihad for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> freed Indian hostage <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> after 20 months of captivity. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a professor of finance at <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, is a legal resident of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

The unattributed report said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government agreed to pay $ 7 million in ransom to the militants holding the hostages but refused the group's demands for immunity from prosecution. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the report was `` not true.'' The report said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refusal to guarantee immunity angered the kidnappers and prompted them to release <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> instead of <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen whose release had been expected.

Two <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> publications reported today that <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for more than 20 months, will be freed in 72 hours. One report was carried by the conservative daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anwar </ORGANIZATION>, based in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It has no record of authoritative reports on the hostage issue, and there was no way to confirm the report. Ash-Shiraa, based in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and two other British hostages will be released `` very soon.'' Both publications cited unidentified informed sources for their reports. Ash-Shiraa gained international fame when it broke the story of secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in November, 1986. But its recent reports on the hostages have not been accurate. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> hotel for a rendezvous with Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, which holds American hostages <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 56. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held captive.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of this week's `` Siege of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'' begged for more people to attend today's demonstrations during the final day of anti-abortion protests after a dramatic drop in attendance. The pleas apparently paid off, because about 50 people were arrested today in two waves of protests at the <LOCATION> Midtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, regional director of the New York-based anti-abortion group <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, told about 40 people at a rally Thursday night to gather early today for a private strategy session. `` We've gotten predictable,'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said earlier at a rally at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jude </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Apostle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> police first arrested 33 demonstrators early today for blocking clinic entrances, as some patients had to be taken over police barricades to get inside, according to witnesses. Later, about 20 more demonstrators were taken into custody. Police did not show the force this morning that they have used this week, instead asking the protesters to walk to police buses `` like gentlemen and ladies.'' When the demonstrators refused, they were carried _ but not dragged _ off the clinic property and into the buses. Several dozen supporters stood on the sidelines singing hymns. The demonstrations, part of a week of protests dubbed `` The Siege of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' began Tuesday, when 343 of an estimated 800 protesters were arrested. Since then, participation both in the daytime demonstrations outside the clinics and nighttime rallies has fallen steadily. Only 14 people were arrested Wednesday and 11 Thursday. The rallies have dwindled from 1,000 people Monday to fewer than 250 Thursday. Speakers at Thursday's rally repeatedly begged for more people to attend the demonstrations, either to risk arrest or provide `` prayer support.'' `` I'm pleading with you before the Lord to come with us tomorrow whether you plan to ` rescue' or not,'' Operation Rescue head <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and other leaders say they are not demonstrating, but are `` rescuing'' fetuses from being killed before they are born. Despite the shrinking numbers, protest leaders maintain they are shutting down clinics temporarily and preventing abortions from being performed. Clinic operators deny that claim, saying the only disruption has been in some rescheduled abortions. Protest leaders also have complained about police brutality, mainly during Tuesday's arrests, and charge that police are deliberately preventing protesters from from getting out of jail. But many of those arrested have refused to give their real names, calling themselves instead Baby <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> or Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, officials said. That identification tactic was used in earlier protests, with demonstrators saying they were expressing solidarity with what they called the anonymous victims of abortion. Authorities have refused to release protesters who do n't give their real names. Of the 368 arrested during the first three days, police said Thursday that 30 had made bond, which was set at $ 650. To combat the demonstrations, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s seven clinics that perform abortions have cooperated by shifting patients from one clinic to another, or helping provide escorts through the demonstrators. Members of Operation Rescue first appeared in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> during the Democratic National Convention in July, and stayed in town for much of the summer. Since the protests began, more than 1,100 anti-abortion protesters have been jailed, mostly on trespassing charges. The Most Rev. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, has endorsed the group's efforts. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a federal appeals court Thursday refused to overturn an injunction prohibiting anti-abortion activists in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> from physically intimidating patrons of a health clinic or yelling loud enough to disrupt business inside. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said that the injunction by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> magistrate in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> does not abridge First Amendment rights of free speech and is not too vague. Advocates for Life, a non-profit corporation that engages in abortion protests, appealed the ruling.

 <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, the Anglican church envoy who has been missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for more than 20 months, will be freed soon, two <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> publications reported today. One of the publications, the weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa, also said American hostages will be released before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election on Nov. 8. Both Ash-Shiraa and the conservative daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anwar </ORGANIZATION> cited unidentified informed sources for its report. There was no way to confirm that <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>'s release was imminent. Al-Anwar said one of its sources reported that <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> `` has been moved from the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> -LRB- valley -RRB- to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern suburbs and predicted he will be released in 72 hours.'' But the newspaper said another source claimed <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, 48, will be freed after resumption of British-Syrian relations. Ash-Shiraa, based in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and two other British hostages will be released `` very soon.'' The magazine said a recent decision for the restoration of full diplomatic relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` provided a strong impetus to efforts currently underway for the release of <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and his countrymen.'' <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> also quoted an unidentified informed security source as saying Monday's release of hostage Mithileshwar Singh, an Indian national and legal resident alien of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, marked `` the beginning of the release of ... American hostages.'' `` The source said American hostages would be released before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election,'' the report added, without further elaboration. Ash-Shiraa gained fame when it broke the story of secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in November 1986.

 Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> rejected demands that he resign as president before his term expires in 1990 and said the military will continue to play a key role in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s future The 72-year-old ruler spoke to the nation after police armed with clubs fired water cannons and tear gas at crowds who swarmed the streets Thursday to celebrate <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat in a national referendum. Police said today that two people were killed in the demonstrations, including a 14-year-old boy shot by unidentified attackers and a 31-year-old robber shot by police. Unknown assailants shot two other people, who were in serious condition today, police said. Eight officers were injured, one seriously, and 58 demonstrators were detained and later released, police said. The capital was calm this morning after street scuffles between roving bands of youths and police in jeeps and water trucks lasted until midnight. In his first public statement since the Wednesday ballot, which he lost by a margin of more than 11 percent, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> declared Thursday night: `` I recognize and accept the majority verdict expressed yesterday by the citizenry.'' According to the terms of an 8-year-old constitution, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remains in power until March 1990, when he will be succeeded by the winner of open elections planned for late next year. Pinohet is not barred from running in the election. He has not indicated whether he plans to run. Reading from a text, the 72-year-old <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> warned the opposition that its plans to amend the existing constitution to speed up his departure would be in vain. `` No one can feel they have the mandate of the people to twist what the people decided,'' he said, in reference to the constitution, which was approved by voters in 1980 in a loosely staged vote that critics complain was rife with fraud. Wednesday's vote was well-organized, massively attended and free of charges of fraud or violence. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> expressed `` the deep pride I feel at the civic maturity with which each one of you faced this act of singular importance.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was dressed in his white dress general's uniform for the taped speech, broadcast nationwide on all television and radio stations. Triumphant opposition leaders Thursday vowed to press their demands for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to allow quick elections and step down soon. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in the 1973 coup that toppled elected President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist. `` An authoritarian system has been overthrown,'' said Socialist <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a director of a 16-party coalition that led the campaign for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat. `` It is indispensable now to elect, within a short period of time, a president and a congress with powers to modify the constitution.'' But the opposition faces the challenge of maintaining its unity. Potentially divisive issues such as human rights trials and the future of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could sow dissent while opposition leaders negotiate with the armed forces to speed the transition to full democracy. Political maneuvering by top opposition figures for nomination to the presidency also is expected to influence relations among the parties in the coalition. The constitution, drawn up by the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> administration, calls for electing a congress in a year. But its provisions leave the legislature virtually powerless to pass amendments. It also gives the armed forces autonomy and an influential role in national policy-making. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, leader of the army, said the military `` will be the guide in building the future <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' Early Thursday, small groups of government opponents descended on downtown to celebrate the referendum result. They were quickly joined by tens of thousands of others, mostly youths, who virtually took control of many streets and some avenues in the city's center, marching and chanting `` <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, go away'' and `` He has fallen.'' Police only occasionally broke up the early demonstrations, but the protesters later became more strident and police began using more force. When the demonstrators began throwing rocks, bottles and sticks at officers, riot-control squads responded with water cannons and tear gas in running street battles.

 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> newspaper reported today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> struck a deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to free <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including the supply of arms and spare parts to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the report `` not true.'' The unattributed report in The Nation, an English-language weekly that began publishing last month, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government agreed to pay $ 7 million in ransom to the Lebanese Shiite Moslem extremists holding most of the hostages but refused the group's demands for immunity from prosecution The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has denied reports it is involved in negotiations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the release of hostages. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> today said he consulted with the national security adviser, <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, about the story, and <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said there were no such weapons transfers. `` There are a lot of free-lancers, independent operators in the region,'' the spokesman said. But he reiterated administration statements that none of these independent parties is authorized to speak for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The report in The Nation said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refusal to guarantee immunity from prosecution angered the kidnappers and prompted them to release Indian hostage <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> on Monday instead of <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen whose release had been expected. According to The Nation, among the steps taken to secure the release of a foreign hostage was an agreement by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to sell millions of dollars in spare parts for U.S.-made weapons. The newspaper said that two weeks before the release of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who is a permanent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resident, South Korean Oil Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bong </PERSON> signed an agreement in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to sell the spare parts, including those needed for the U.S.-made F-5 aircraft used in the Iranian air force. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration would have had to approve such a sale under the standard agreement signed by countries licensed to manufacture U.S-designed weapons, the newspaper said. Today's report also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who hold Iranian and Lebanese passports visited two of the hostages in January, including <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the longest held hostage, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Reporter <PERSON> Giora </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamis </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the report in The Nation was based on interviews with three of about 15 dual passport holders involved in the contacts as well as South Korean sources who confirmed an Iranian report about the spare parts deal. <PERSON> Shamis </PERSON> is an owner of the London-based news service, Depth, which sold the story to The Nation. According to the report, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to put up the $ 7 million ransom for the hostages because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not want to appear to be directly purchasing their freedom. The newspaper said the money would be paid indirectly to the kidnappers by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the form of commissions for Iranian purchases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. These are to be channeled through Lebanese and Iranian businessmen to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, the radical Shiite group believed to be holding hostages. Sixteen foreign hostages are believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans.

 Two frugal sisters who never took part in municipal affairs and never let on how much money they had saved have surprised the city by leaving it a $ 1 million trust fund. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> had no immediate relatives to inherit the money and wanted to do something special for the town, said their cousin, <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, 93, died in March, and <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON>, 94, died in February 1986. <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> described the women as a quiet, frugal, hard-working pair who generally kept to themselves. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> earned her money as a stenographer and <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> was a sales manager and worked in the pharmaceutical industry for more than 50 years. `` They never left town, never got involved in local affairs, never learned how to drive and never married,'' he said. `` They would get off the <LOCATION> Fall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> streetcar just before the fare went up and walk the last quarter-mile home to save a nickel. `` That nickel could buy a loaf of bread, they'd say.'' The $ 1 million will be invested to provide income for local educational and charitable pursuits. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamonde </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Durfee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attleboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said it could generate $ 75,000 a year in interest. A three-member advisory board will recommend to the bank how the interest should be spent, <PERSON> Lamonde </PERSON> said.

 A Soviet military team said today it was generally satisfied with its unprecedented snap inspection of a British military exercise in southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The four Soviet inspectors scrutinized the 4,400-troop Drum's <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> exercise for two hours today before departing for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> The team leader, Col. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Greshnikov </PERSON>, thanked the British army for its hospitality during their two-day tour. `` The results of the inspection will have to be examined in more detail, but I am sure they can be considered positive,'' <PERSON> Greshnikov </PERSON> told a news conference at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>, speaking through an interpreter. <PERSON> Greshnikov </PERSON> said his team _ including <PERSON> Anatoli </PERSON> <PERSON> Makhov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Trofimov </PERSON> _ were `` generally satisfied'' with the tour, adding that `` this kind of inspection will help to build confidence measures in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The inspectors arrived Wednesday after giving <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> the 36-hour minimum notice for an inspection as required under the 1986 Stockholm Agreement for relaxing East-West tensions. They sought to assess the `` character and scale'' of <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>'s Drum, which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> described as a defensive eight-day exercise to test protection of airfields, ports and other installations British army Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>, who joined <PERSON> Greshnikov </PERSON> at the news conference, said the Soviets had seen `` a lot of nothing.'' The Soviets spent a hectic two days in helicopters and <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rovers </ORGANIZATION> touring the 5,500-square-mile exercise area near <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>, 80 miles southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It was the first time the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had called a snap inspection in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> under the 35-nation verification treaty, though British inspectors have dropped in on Soviet maneuvers, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Vice Marshal <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Stear </PERSON> said. `` I am pleased that the inspection of each other's military activities is becoming more commonplace, for familiarity does build confidence and trust,'' <PERSON> Stear </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s foreign minister accused <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> ally <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> of violating the human rights of its Hungarian minority and said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was not taking sides in the dispute. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON> leveled the accusation against <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> by name, but in a speech Tuesday to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> he decried `` cultural oppression'' of minorities in `` neighboring countries.'' `` It is clear that our problem in this regard is with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> Thursday. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s Hungarian minority is being systematically mistreated. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> denies the accusation. Although both sides have publicly criticized each other numerous times in recent months, <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON>'s comments were unusually candid criticism on a senior level of an ally within the Soviet bloc. The most recent tensions involve Romanian plans to raze up to 7,000 villages, including about 800 ethnic Hungarian communities. The Romanian leadership says it needs the land for development and plans to resettle the villagers in agro-industrial centers. Hungarian officials say, however, that the project will destroy deep-seated traditions of the ethnic Hungarians, who became Romanian citizens after World War II when <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was forced to cede the territory to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. In the interview, <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON> acknowledged that the conflict was figuring in Hungarian-Soviet discussions. But he said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership would `` like us to solve the question'' directly with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. A diplomat from a Soviet bloc country, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was particularly reluctant to get involved in the dispute because of its own problems with ethnic unrest in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and the Baltic republics. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> denies its 1.7 million Hungarians are being mistreated and accuses <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> of interfering in its internal affairs. Attempts late Thursday for Romanian comment were unsucessful. No one answered the telephone at <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission. The resettlement plan touched off mass protests in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, including a demonstration in front of the Romanian Embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. Police did not intervene in the protests. `` We are all concerned about a situation where an ethnic minority is about to be stripped of its roots,'' said <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON>, referring to the resettlement project. The foreign minister, who was interviewed in Hungarian, denied that the criticism constituted interference in Romanian matters, saying, `` We believe that the question of minority rights is not strictly an internal affair.'' <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has begun to accept refugees from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the only Soviet bloc country to give asylum to those fleeing from an allied nation. <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON> said about 10,000 Romanian citizens have fled to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, most of them ethnic Hungarians. While there are no official figures on the number of ethnic Romanians among the refugees, Hungarian officials estimate they constitute between 10 percent to 15 percent of the total, most of them fleeing economic hardships and political repression.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, whose predecessor was under criminal investigation for 14 months, called on <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials under him today to develop proposals that will `` aid our employees in maintaining the highest ethical standards.'' In his first major speech to department employees since taking over from <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in August, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he had asked Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> to gather the views of all department managers on ethical standards. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said that among the questions that should be addressed are `` How to avoid any appearance of personal and financial conflict of interest? How to deal with lapses in behavior, whether job-related or not? How should we properly regulate interaction between employees and outside groups? What ` perks' are proper and which are out of bounds?'' `` Top leadership must give forth clear and explicit signals, lest any confusion or uncertainty exist over what is and is not permissible conduct,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` To do otherwise allows informal and potentially subversive ` codes of conduct' to be transmitted with a wink and a nod, and encourages an inferior ethical system based on ` going along to get along' or on the notion that ` everybody's doing it,''' he added. He said he had asked <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> `` to gather the views of all senior management to help in developing proposals that will aid our employees in maintaining the highest ethical standards.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> did not mention <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by name and the new attorney general brought up the issue of ethics in the context of a new Associated Press-Media General poll showing that seven out of 10 Americans think illegal payoffs are common in the federal government. Half of those polled said the federal government is not honest overall. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> came under criminal investigation in May 1987 because of his dealings with longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> in connection with scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, defense contractor whose top executives admitted making payoffs to numerous public officials in exchange for assistance in obtaining federal contracts. The investigation of the attorney general eventually spread to his actions on behalf of the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies at a time when he held stock in them, as well as other matters. The probe culminated in July with independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> deciding not to seek an indictment, but declaring publicly that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had probably broken conflict-of-interest laws and tax laws.

 Thousands of parents lined up at clinics to immunize their babies against polio today in the first stage of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s nationwide campaign to vaccinate all residents under the age of 40. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced the campaign following an outbreak of the disease that has affected at least nine people. About 3.2 million people will be vaccinated over the next four weeks, according to ministry spokesman <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Algrabli </PERSON>. The campaign does not include the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Algrabli </PERSON> said this is because <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> residents have been immunized with a highly effective combined Sabin-Salk vaccine. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, he said, officials are testing sewage to determine whether to extend the campaign there. The first stage of the campaign will encompass the towns of <LOCATION> Rehovot </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Acre </LOCATION> in the north, where the polio virus has been found in sewage. In <LOCATION> Rehovot </LOCATION>, large yellow posters plastered on the walls informed residents when various age groups should report to clinics for vaccinations. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern that reports of the outbreak would keep visitors away from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has already suffered a sharp drop in tourism this year as a result of the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. The immunization campaign was undertaken after health officials received the recommendations of a team of international health experts called to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the first polio cases were diagnosed, <PERSON> Algrabli </PERSON> said. No cases of polio were reported in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last year and only one case was reported in 1986. The recent cases have been blamed on overflowing sewage. Polio is an infectious disease that causes muscular paralysis.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today cited crime as the issue on which he is most at odds with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rival has `` an astounding lack of sensitivity'' to crime victims. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had presided over a criminal justice system in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> that is `` completely out of whack: a ` Twilight Zone' world where prisoners' right to privacy had more weight than the citizen's right to safety. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in remarks prepared for delivery to law enforcement officials, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` still clings to a discredited liberal idology that blinds him to the true causes of crime.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> only amended his state's prison furlough law this year `` under the bright spotlight of the national presidential campaign.'' Last spring, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ended furloughs for convicted murderers serving life without parole. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should have apologized to a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple savagely attacked by convicted murderer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, who had been granted a weekend <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough in 1986. The couple, <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Angi </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, have agreed to tape radio ads on behalf of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign `` As far as I know ... he has never apologized,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'm not faulting the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for one error in judgment. But it concerns me deeply that in all this time, as far as I know, the governor has never acknowledged that his furlough program was a mistake,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` While the governor has shown great compassion for the difficulties of prisoners and their families _ and no doubt their hardships are severe _ when it comes to the plight of the victims and their families, there is what one can only describe as an astounding lack of sensitivity, a lack of human compassion.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is seizing on the law and order issue as the tight race with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> nears Election Day. Another crime-oriented speech is set for Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket was eager to move beyond reverberations from the vice presidential debate. Though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> on Thursday focused on comparing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` You're going to see this debate wo n't make a difference,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> told reporters traveling with the campaign. `` The focus of the race is going to be between two gladiators'' _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. While a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll found that 50 percent of the likely voters surveyed thought <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> won the debate to 27 percent for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> was claiming that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has solidified an <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> base of 210 to 220 of the 270 votes needed to win. `` That gives us an opportunity to really concentrate on three or four states in the waning days of the campaign,'' he said. Asked to name the states, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> declined, giving only a list of what he said are competitive states, including <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised his running mate immediately after the debate, he did not mention <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at all in his first speech Thursday morning in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. After reporters asked his aides about the omission, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opened two later rallies hailing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance. At the <ORGANIZATION> Permian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prefaced his energy policy speech with a lengthy ode to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, reciting anecdotes about his move there from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> as a young man and his start in the oil business painting rigs similar to the one behind him. He said he was the only candidate `` who shares the values of the people of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ... My values have not changed since the 1950s.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategists professed to be unconcerned about <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s heavy campaigning in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the state he represents in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` The problem is he ca n't sell <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> regional political director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is a popular Texan, there's no doubt about it. But he's selling the wrong soap down here.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has been using an anti-crime TV commercial in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and will begin an ad focusing on defense, which as an industry is responsible for a hefty number of jobs in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said. The anti-crime theme apparently will be a central one for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the waning days of the campaign, with another law-and-order speech slated for Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. In his Fort Worth speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed doubling the nation's spending on new prison construction, with the addition of $ 250 million annually over the next four years He also said he would set up a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> anti-gang unit to work with local jurisdictions. He said money seized from drug busts should be used to help fund the new prisons. `` I say that our society can simply not afford any more liberal experimentation with crime. It's time to get serious about serious crime,'' he said in a speech where he repeatedly used the word `` liberal'' to criticize failed anti-crime policies and linked them to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

About 6.5 million of the lighters have been distributed since they were introduced in July, the agency said. No incidents or injuries have been reported involving the lighters.

The problem has been corrected on lighters now being made, officials said. The lighters in question are sold in a plastic pouch or tray and are labeled `` with fixed flame.'' They can be identified because they do not have the small wheel used on some lighters to adjust the flame size. Bic Mini fixed flame lighters and <ORGANIZATION> Bic </ORGANIZATION> regular sized adjustable lighters, which represent 98 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Bic </ORGANIZATION> lighters on the market, are not involved in the recall, the commission said. Consumers should stop use of the regular size fixed flame lighters and return them to the store where purchased for a refund. Those needing more information can contact the commission at 1-800-638-2772.

 Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said today he was not worried about new television ads aimed at him by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign because `` they obviously do n't have anything bad to say about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked by reporters as he toured a technical school whether he had become the key issue in the campaign. `` We can stand the attention. We can stand the heat. We're going to stay in the kitchen,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to be the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The voters will vote for him.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was greeted by a group of about 75 protesters as he toured <ORGANIZATION> Chattanooga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Some carried signs reading, `` We will all pray if <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> becomes president.'' During a tour of the school's robotics lab, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked by reporters about ads the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign unveiled Thursday aimed at driving home the idea that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had picked an unqualified man as his running mate. `` I have n't seen them. I've heard about them. They obviously do n't have anything bad to say about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and that's fine with me,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has shrugged off polls indicating voters believe he lost the vice presidential debate and doubt his qualifications. Despite that rhetoric, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> acknowledged to reporters Thursday that he could have answered more fully questions from debate panelists about what he would do if he became president. But the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator focused his efforts Thursday on attacking <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> counterpart <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, saying he `` waffled, shuffled, ducked and dived'' questions about his differences with ticketmate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was campaigning today in <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We're on the march toward victory,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters who asked him upon arrival here how he felt a day after the debate. He said he had had `` a great day.'' `` I think you can tell the real enthusiasm that the crowds have generated,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, stop. He spent Thursday refining his answer to questions he was repeatedly asked in Wednesday night's debate about how he would handle the presidency. Polls all along have shown substantial skepticism among the voters about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications. A new <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll done after the debate found 47 percent of the likely voters surveyed felt he was qualified, compared with 78 percent for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. And both CBS and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> polls said a resounding majority of those who viewed the debate thought <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had won. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was `` not at all worried'' about the polls, adding `` we're still ahead.'' `` As far as we're concerned, the important polls are those from the key electoral states,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>. `` The only poll we're interest in is on Nov. 8.'' But the campaign was clearly concerned about the fallout from <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s response to questions about what he would do if he had to step into the presidency. He had answered that he would first pray and then convene a Cabinet session but did not go further, electing to talk mostly about his congressional experience and qualifications. `` When I was asked that question, I made a judgment that the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> deserved to hear me outline the level of my qualifications and the depth of my experience to assume the presidency,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in speeches in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` I responded to that point and the core of my thinking is this: There is no question that I would maintain and build on the excellent policies of a president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Asked by reporters on his plane why he had not made that response during the debate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: `` It was a very narrow hypothetical ... I had n't had that question before. `` By convening a Cabinet session, that certainly implies that you're going to continue the policies of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. I did not say that, but that's certainly implied. I think I did just fine last night.'' One of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s defenders was former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, who told a <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, fund-raiser, `` I think <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is an outstanding young man and he will do a superb job as the next vice president.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, himself a former <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> congressman, said that on the issue of qualifications, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s 12 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were more than enough. `` I happen to think that people who come from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are better trained to serve in the executive branch ... than some inexperienced governor with a wild-eyed, left-wing liberal philosophy like the Democratic candidate's,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in strong terms, saying that he had been unable to defend <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' positions. `` I am proud of the man at the top of my ticket,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I am happy to support his positions, and I wo n't run away from them like Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did last night.''

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets Discussing Changes In World Court</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has proposed to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that it accept decisions of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in interpretations of a host of international treaties, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said today. Some of the decision deal with such technical subjects as patents and others with diplomatic privileges. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a party to must of the treaties but the Soviets over the years have registered `` reservations'' that exempt them from the effects of many of the treaties, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals, which also involve greater use of the court, were conveyed to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during the summer in response to hints from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other Soviet officials in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> speeches that they were prepared to consider changes. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is coordinating its approach with a number of Western allies, the official said. He declined to provide further details, saying it was `` a sensitive subject.'' But the official said `` a host of multilateral treaties'' were involved. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> stressed Thursday that `` it's our view that issues involving the use of force and national security do not belong in the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>.'' She said further discussions would be held with the Soviets and that she had no details of possible suggested changes in the court's operations. Two years ago, in an unprecedented move, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration rejected the court's jurisdiction in a dispute with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Marxist government in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> had sued the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before the court for mining its harbors and aiding Nicaraguan rebels. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>'s statement indicated the administration held to the view, which was developed by <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, a former federal judge who is the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> chief legal counsel. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> on Thursday as saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had responded `` in a constructive way'' to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s initiative. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had suggested the court be permitted to arbitrate a list of specific disputes between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and agree in advance to accept its verdict, the Times reported. If accepted by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the article said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals would bind both nations to <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> verdicts in disputes over certain treaties. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has made a proposal on the issue of greater use of the <ORGANIZATION> ICJ </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to the Soviets this summer, which is wholly consistent with this administration's view of the appropriate role of the Court in resolve international disputes.'' She said this did not involve a change in the stand the administration took in the dispute with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> did not respond to efforts to reach him by telephone for details.

 A woman who said she shot her husband 14 times because he had beaten and abused her for years was acquitted of murder. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Iandola </PERSON>, 36, was charged with first-degree murder after she shot her husband, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, in the kitchen of their home Jan. 11. A <LOCATION> McHenry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury deliberated nine hours before reaching the verdict, which was greeted by cheers in the courtroom when it was announced Thursday. Mrs. <PERSON> Iandola </PERSON> contended the killing was in self-defense because her husband had threatened to kill her and their two children. She testified that in one incident a few days before the shooting, her husband sexually abused her with the barrel of a gun and indicated that he might try to rape their 13-year-old daughter. Much of her testimony was corroborated by witnesses at her trial. Judge <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> refused to allow defense attorneys to present expert testimony indicating that Mrs. <PERSON> Iandola </PERSON> was a victim of `` battered woman's syndrome,'' a phenomenon in which the wife submits passively to abuse from a bullying husband.

 Israeli troops shot and killed three Palestinians and wounded 14 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters and hospital officials said. Army officials confirmed one Palestinian was killed but said soldiers were not involved. The other two deaths were being checked, a spokeswoman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The three deaths raised the number of Palestinians killed in the 10-month-old uprising to 287. Six Israelis have also died. Arab reporters claimed <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahloul </PERSON>, 26, was shot to death standing in the doorway of his house in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, a city of 120,000. They said <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Najar </PERSON>, 20, was fatally wounded after dozens of youths gathered outside the central market to throw stones at soldiers in protest of the killing of <LOCATION> Bahloul </LOCATION>. A third victim, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeh </PERSON>, 20, was dead on arrival at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> after being shot in the chest during a clash in the <LOCATION> Ras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ain </LOCATION> neighborhood, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters and hospital officials said All victims died from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> army gunfire, the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Earlier today, hundreds of Palestinians marched in a funeral procession for <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanfa </PERSON>, 31, who was shot to death in a clash with soldiers Thursday. The mourners carried outlawed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flags and chanted pro-Palestine <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> slogans, a witness said. Israeli authorities, in an attempt to calm the city, announced from mosque loudspeakers that prayers would take place as scheduled today and the army would not intefere. An Arab reporter in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said shops were closed for the second consecutive day today in a separate strike. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, city officials said the opening of 32 Arab junior high and high schools went smoothly Thursday when 6,000 students returned to classes. Authorities delayed the opening of the academic year because they feared classrooms would be used as focal points for organizing demonstrations. On Thursday, Moslem fundamentalists said they have ended their rift with leaders of a PLO-linked group in the occupied lands. The reconciliation was announced in a leaflet saying the groups would focus on a common enemy: <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The competition should be in how we fight the enemy,'' the statement said. `` The most dangerous weapon that the enemy is using is the policy of splitting our people.'' Army officials played down the rapprochement between the fundamentalist group <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> and the PLO-linked Unified National Leadership of the Uprising. `` I'm not sure it means they are going to stop fighting,'' one official said on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> advocates the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and is at odds with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction, which has advocated more moderate policies and is considering recognition of the Jewish state.

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> today made light of Republican assertions that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> held his own during their vice presidential debate. `` I was reading the paper this morning where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he thought <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> won that, and yet every ... I'm sorry,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, breaking into laughter and drawing a roar from a crowd at a Democratic breakfast. `` And yet every poll showed we won, and I'd say ` <PERSON> George </PERSON>, as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would say, facts are very troubling things,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said the Democrats were better on key issues to his home state, including a realistic defense policy, a strong trade policy, and help for the domestic oil industry. And he said his debate might later be seen as `` a turning point'' in this year's campaign. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for trying to compare himself in the debate to President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. It was an `` incredible misfit,'' he said, ticking off <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s accomplishments. Despite <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s presence on the ticket, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leads <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the Lone Star state by up to 10 points, according to recent polls. The Democrats contend the gap is n't that big, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is campaigning heavily in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> during the next few days in hopes of tightening th race for the state's 29 electoral votes. `` The next couple of days I think will be significant,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s campaign chief of staff. `` We can move these numbers in the next couple of weeks.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> planned to continue stumping across <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> today, with events in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. After a stop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, he planned to hit <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> on Saturday and then return to the state for part of his campaign trip next week. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> studied for the debate in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and he returned to the state Thursday. He met up with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at a rally in Lone Star, in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` Last night, the eyes of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the whole nation were on you, and they liked what they saw,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told his running mate. Normally, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> introduces <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but their roles were reversed as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought to show off his running mate as a conquering hero. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> declined to praise himself, but he picked up on his pre-debate pattern of criticizing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` After listening to <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> last night, I can understand why he kept talking about job training,'' he said at the rally. `` The polls show that those that were concerned about his qualifications for the presidency had that buttressed by the debate last night,'' he told reporters. A new <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll done after the debate found 78 percent of the 412 debate watchers surveyed felt <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was qualified to be president, if that became necessary, to 47 percent for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Asked who won the debate, 50 percent in the survey chose <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and 27 percent said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The result was almost precisely the same as the 51-27 percent split in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll done immediately after the debate ended Wednesday night. The campaign hopes to take advantage of the momentum from the perceived debate victory with the help of its new national television ads and phone banks assembled for the final weeks of the campaign. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Republicans have been hitting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hard on the issues of crime and gun control, and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign was considering running some Texas-specific ads to start fighting back, a campaign aide said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other Republicans contended Thursday that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s admonishing of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> during the debate that he was `` no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'' was a `` cheap shot'' and a planned response. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> denied both. `` What happened there was <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> kept comparing himself with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, just overreaching himself, and I got fed up with it,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` I deeply resented him trying to put <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s mantle over himself when he did n't have a record that compared with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> were elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> together in 1948. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> served three terms in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> before dropping out of politics for 16 years to pursue a business career.

About an hour later, police said they found a bomb at a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> branch in downtown <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. Police evacuated thousands of people from surrounding office buildings and cordoned off the area, witnesses said.

 Two men who admitted setting fire to a house suspected of being used to deal cocaine have been acquitted by a jury, leading city officials to warn against vigilante action. Jury foreman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said Thursday's verdict was a way of telling city officials more has to be done to fight drugs. `` I imagine the verdict does send out a message in two directions _ to the mayor and to the Police Department that more has to be done about crack houses,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> were found innocent after a two-day trial. They admitted setting the fire, saying they feared for the safety of children in their neighborhood. `` I hope this verdict sends no message,'' Presiding Judge <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> told the jurors. `` It applies to the facts only in this case.'' But some jurors said they cleared <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> because <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s drug problem could cause people to take extreme measures. `` -LRB- I -RRB- would have probably done the same thing.

The charges stemmed from fires in October and November 1987 at an abandoned house allegedly occupied by drug dealers who the defendants testified had turned their quiet, working-class neighborhood into a place of fear. `` They were laughing at the neighborhood,'' <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> testified. Defense attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Steingold </PERSON> said residents of the neighborhood were continually frightened by the sound of gunfire. <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said they started the fires after police failed to investigate complaints filed by them and other residents.

<HEAD>Studies Find High Rates Of Smokeless Tobacco Use Among American
Indians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Young American Indians are using smokeless tobacco at an alarming rate, say health researchers who have found children as young kindergarteners chewing tobacco or taking snuff. New studies reported Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> found that use of smokeless tobacco among Indian teen-agers on reservations is higher than among rural non-Indian adolescents; that <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> start using it at a younger age; and that boys and girls alike show frequent use of it on Indian reservations. As many as 21 percent of kindergarten children on reservations use smokeless tobacco, the researchers said, and by the time they reach high school age, 37 percent already show related signs of mouth disease. Smokeless tobacco _ such as snuff and chewing tobacco _ causes mouth cancer and other oral disease, and can produce nicotine addiction similar to that of cigarette smoking, according to federal health officials. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> did not speculate on reasons for the increased use of smokeless tobacco by reservation youths, but said more research is needed. In a 1986 survey on the <ORGANIZATION> Rosebud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sioux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION> in rural <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 37 percent of the students in grades 7-12 and 18 percent of those in grades kindergarten-6 said they regularly used smokeless tobacco _ including 21 percent of the kindergarten pupils. In grades K-6, boys used smokeless tobacco more often than girls by a margin of 21 percent to 15 percent. But by grades 7-12, the margin was only 39 percent to 35 percent. By contrast, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> on Smoking and Health estimates that 2 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adult men and 0.5 percent of adult women use smokeless tobacco. An estimated 22 million Americans have used it. Another survey, comparing non-Indian children in rural <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> with their Indian counterparts on four rural <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> reservations, found the Indian youth 10 times more likely to use smokeless tobacco _ 34 percent to 3.4 percent. That was despite the fact that `` both groups lived outside urban areas and would be expected to share certain characteristics,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. That same survey suggested `` that this behavior is not necessarily learned from parents,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Indian adolescents reported that only 14 percent of their fathers and 3 percent of their mothers had ever used smokeless tobacco. Smokeless tobacco use, however, was much lower among urban Indians than their counterparts on reservations. A survey of Indians on <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s Blackfeet Reservation and in the city of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, found that while 19 percent of the males 15-24 in the city used smokeless tobacco, on the reservation, the percentage was 57. A similar difference was reported among young women, 3 percent to 12 percent. That same survey found sharp differences in use among young Indians and their parents. Twenty percent of the Blackfeet men over 34 and 3 percent of the women over 34 used smokeless tobacco, compared again to 57 percent and 12 percent among the 15-24 age groups.

<TEXT>
 A man who spent three months in a Nicaraguan prison after his Contra supply plane was shot down has filed a $ 135 million damage suit against two men and two companies linked to the Iran-Contra arms deals. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON>' federal suit accuses <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and CIA-linked <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sevices </ORGANIZATION> of misrepresenting the rebel supply mission as a patriotic effort when in fact they were making profits off the deal. `` <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> had a history of profiteering in arms transactions and undertook participation in the Contra assistance effort with the intent of deriving substantial profits for themselves,'' the suit charges. The suit was belittled by <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who said Thursday that <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> knew the risks of the flights. `` Nobody put a gun to <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> and told him to step on the airplane,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. `` This is a clasic case of a mercenary who knew about the risks, and yet chose in his adult mind to go ahead with it.'' <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> said that when he was hired in May 1986 he was told the operation would be a first-class operation like <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. But he said the defendants failed to give the plane adequate defense systems, such as a way to avoid heat-seeking missiles. `` In fact, defendants intentionally refused to supply parachutes to <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> and others, apparently so that there would be no survivors in the event of a crash,'' charges the suit, filed Tuesday. Three fellow crewmen aboard the plane died in the crash. He also said his employers had promised his wife they would take care of his defense after he was shot down in October 1986, but failed to do so. As a result of the defendants' promises of help, <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON>' wife <PERSON> Sally </PERSON>, also a plaintiff in the suit filed Tuesday, never set up a defense committee, the suit says. Although convicted of aiding the Contra rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government, <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> was released three months later. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general, are accused with former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> figures <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> of conspiring to defraud the government by diverting proceeds from the arms-for-hostages deals with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to the Contras at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels.

<TEXT>
 A message the opposition says was sent by the office of Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders in factories restates the authorities' public stance against legalizing Solidarity. But the telexed message left open the possibility of changing the trade union law after talks this month between Solidarity leaders and the government. The message was dated Sept. 26. A Solidarity spokesman today said he was not concerned about the message and Solidarity would enter the talks anyway. He said it was significant that it was addressed to party cells and not to factory managers. `` We are not running away from a discussion about the shape of the union movement, but we think that it must take into account the fact that the union question is an element of a broader problem of the functioning of the political system,'' the message said. Government spokesman <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> said today he could not confirm or deny the authenticity of the text, read over the telephone to Western news agencies by Solidarity activists late Thursday. But the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news service later ran a one-sentence report saying the `` secret document'' quoted by Western news agencies `` does not exist.'' The text contained nothing new on the government's position regarding Solidarity, but it underlined the degree of concern over Solidarity chapters springing up openly in many factories on the eve of the promised talks. It urged party leaders to draw pro-Solidarity activists into officially sanctioned unions, giving them proportional representation in official union leaderships and making the official unions reflect workers' demands. At the same time, the message warned against allowing the opposition to make gains of its own on the factory floors. `` The main real danger ... is the rebirth of Solidarity structures as they existed in 1981, that is, as a party of strikes and confrontation. This is what we must all focus our attention on,'' the message said. The government and Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> agreed to the talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future during a wave of strikes in August. The talks are expected to begin around Oct. 17. The opposition has stressed that the talks must result in recognition of Solidarity, suppressed by authorities since a Dec. 13, 1981, martial-law crackdown. The government has said repeatedly that it will not agree to any arrangement that would bring divisions on the factory floor and that it supports the principle of one union in one workplace. According to the text read by Solidarity, the telex was from <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Domagala </PERSON>, the head of the chancellory of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> secretariat, and was addressed to first secretaries of party committees at the nation's factories. Solidarity spokesmen did not disclose how they received the document.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Newsweek magazine is offering early retirement to 100 employees, or 10 percent of its work force, because of higher costs and a shrinking advertisement base, a spokesman said today. `` The program is entirely voluntary,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON>. `` It's not draconian in any way.'' <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> said 100 fulltime employees _ those with 25 years or more of service or those age 55 and older with 10 years at the magazine _ received letters detailing the offer. He said it includes pension enhancement and continuation of some insurance benefits. The size of the package will vary depending on the employees' age and length of service. The weekly magazine's revenues were up 1 percent during the first half of 1988 and <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> said domestic circulation was at an `` all time high of 3.3 million.'' However, the number of domestic ad pages has dropped 6 percent from a year ago. `` Obviously, our costs have gone up substantially, primarily postage and paper, and the advertising environment has become increasingly competitive,'' said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, a magazine spokeswoman. `` It forces us to operate in as lean and smart a way as we can.'' <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> said 60 percent of those offered early retirement were on the business side of the magazine and the rest were editorial employees.

<HEAD>Seaga Lowers Hurricane Damage Estimate to $1 Billion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hurricane Gilbert caused $ 818 million to $ 1 billion damage to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, less than previously estimated, Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said. The prime minister originally estimated <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> caused $ 8 billion in damage when it slammed into the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island with 130 mph winds Sept. 12. In a report to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> already has raised enough money from other countries to finance immediate emergency needs. He said about $ 515 million was received or pledged by other countries and international financial institutions for rebuilding the ravaged economy, including a $ 125 million pledge from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The government's latest reports said 45 people were killed when the hurricane ripped the length of the island, severely damaging or destroying half of its 500,000 homes and wiping out hundreds of acres of banana, coconut and citrus crops. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> noted that $ 1 billion is almost 80 percent of what the country gets in foreign-exchange earnings annually. `` To find up to $ 1 billion for hurricane emergency relief is in effect to embark on a program to almost double the value of foreign-exchange earnings in one year,'' which would normally be a seven or 10-year goal, <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said. `` This target, however, is required not in seven to 10 years, but in seven to 10 days,'' he said. Later, on radio and television, <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> told Jamaicans he had set a Christmas deadline `` to break the back of the rebuilding program.'' `` By no means all the work will be completed by then,'' he said. `` But hopefully comfort will be restored to those who are shelterless, farmers will be in the field and the lights will shine again.'' He said the pledges from other countries and institutions such as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> will finance the government's emergency spending, but more money will be needed for the private sector. `` The financial picture, therefore, is one of good order, with the necessary funding in place to finance the emergency and normal operations of the country for the entire fiscal year,'' <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said. Relief organizations say tons of donated food and other relief supplies are being distributed and consumed almost as soon as they arrive from abroad, but much more is needed to feed and shelter tens of thousands of people.

 Forty percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policemen have had less than 10 years of schooling, and police must be better educated, the nation's top public security official said. Public Security Minister <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said on Thursday that many police have no professional training, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> spoke at the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Univesity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION>, which has an enrollment of 1,500. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said 100,000 public security employees are taking classes at correspondence schools and night schools or studying on their own. About 90,000 more were trained at special colleges and vocational schools in the past decade, he said. Officials blame low educational levels for police problems such as taking bribes, extorting money and gaining confession by torture. In the first half of 1988 more than 2,100 policemen were punished for abuse of power.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> renewed his attack today on <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' prisoner-furlough program, saying Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lacks compassion for crime victims. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would keep up his criticism of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as a potential president and of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for choosing him as running mate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, commenting today as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, said there are two issues: whether <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is qualified to be president and whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has good judgment. `` I'm going to hit it and hit it hard,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> himself said today he was not worried about new television ads questioning his worthiness for high office. He said the Democrats' ads focusing on him mean `` they obviously do n't have anything bad to say about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, still energized by what is widely seen as his debate victory over <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> Wednesday night, made fun of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had done well. `` And yet every poll showed we won, and I'd say ` George ... facts are very troubling things,''' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> today, after telling a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, audience Thursday night, `` There are, as we know, going to be major changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Do you want the man who selected <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to be making those appointments?'' When the 41st president takes office in January, three of the justices will be over 80 _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said the next president `` will very possibly appoint two or three justices to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, where they'll sit well into the next century.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Xenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, concentrating on crime and declaring that `` on no other issue is my opponent's philosophy so completely at odds with mine, and I would say with the common sense attitudes of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' `` While the governor has shown great compassion for the difficulties of prisoners and their families _ and no doubt their hardships are severe _ when it comes to the plight of the victims and their families, there is what one can only describe as an astounding lack of sensitivity, a lack of human compassion,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for delivery to law enforcement officials. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should have apologized to a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple who were attacked by convicted murderer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> who had been granted a weekend <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough in 1986. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has called the incident `` a tragic occurrence.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, was asked by reporters as he toured a technical school whether he had become the key issue in the campaign. `` We can stand the attention. We can stand the heat,'' he said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to be the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The voters will vote for him.'' In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said his debate with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> might eventually be seen as `` a turning point'' in the campaign. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> renewed his criticism of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for trying to compare his experience to that of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in 1960. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> listed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s pre-presidency accomplishments, including his war record and his winning of a Pulitzer Prize, and said a comparison of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was an `` incredible misfit.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pressed his direct attack on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> _ and indirect criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision-making ability _ with new television commercials portraying the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator as unfit for the vice presidency. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who barely mentioned <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> during campaign appearance earlier in the day Thursday, told an evening rally in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> proved himself in his Wednesday night debate. `` He did an outstanding job and he has been unfairly pounded by my opponents,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And last night, last night, the country saw what I have seen all along _ a young, knowledgeable, experienced American and I am proud to have put my trust in a whole generation of young people.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s best known surrogate _ President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ said, `` I really think that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> actually, just by the whole nature of the event, headed off, or should have headed off, all this picking on him that has been going on.'' A second poll released Thursday supported the Democrats' contention that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> outshone <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in their debate An <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> survey of 412 debate watchers found 50 percent believe <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> won the debate to 27 percent for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The result was almost precisely the 51-27 percent split in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll taken immediately after the debate ended. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll also found that half the voters still doubt <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications to serve as president, if the need arose. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was rated as qualified to be president by 47 percent while <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was rated as qualified by 78 percent. In his first appearance in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> failed to mention <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s debate performance. Instead, the Republican nominee proposed doubling the nation's spending on new prison construction and instituting a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> anti-gang unit to work with local jurisdictions. The Democratic nominee described <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance as `` programmed beyond belief,'' and said the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator seemed `` extremely insecure.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, `` Great work, again.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, meanwhile, released a pair of television ads belittling <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. One commercial notes that one in five vice presidents have been thrust into the presidency while an announcers says, `` After five months of reflection, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his personal choice _ <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Hopefully, we will never know how great a lapse of judgment that really was.'' In the second ad, part of the `` Packaging of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' series, so-called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign advisers discuss the selection of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` We've got a disaster on our hands,'' says one adviser. Another wonders if the ticket can still dump <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and `` bring in <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>.''

The main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has been gaining support in opinion polls since the last election, charges the government has not done enough for students and the poor.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today he would continue to slam Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as unfit for the vice presidency and depict rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as weak for selecting the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator. `` I'm going to hit it and hit it hard,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> issue is double-edged: Is <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> qualified to be president and does <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have any judgment? `` Strong presidents look for strong vice presidents,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Thursday, showering praise on <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and offering ridicule for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` Weak candidates look for something else.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took the attack a step further in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, telling a rally in a renovated theater: `` There are as we know, going to be major changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Do you want the man who selected <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to be making those appointments?'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was campaigning today in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlina </LOCATION>, both regarded as closely contested states, before returning home to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for the evening. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> belittled Republican <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> after flying in from tiny <LOCATION> Lone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Star </LOCATION> <LOCATION> in </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> where he joined <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for their first appearance following the vice presidential debate in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>. After earlier describing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as seeming `` extremely insecure'' and `` programmed beyond belief'' in his televised confrontation, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the comparison with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was hving an immediate effect on the Democratic ticket. `` I think it's one of the reasons why people are switching, why this campaign of ours is starting to win,'' he told reporters after arriving in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, before heading off on their separate ways on the campaign trail, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> looked ahead to his final remaining debate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> next week in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> as he said goodbye to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on an airport tarmac. `` Great work, again,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator. `` I'll see if I can approach it. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign moved swiftly to begin airing a pair of television commercials belittling <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The ads were produced before the debate and contain no reference to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s stinging retort to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> _ `` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' But the campaign did not air the ads until after the debate, confident of the wide perception <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had done well and that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had not put to rest questions about himself. One ad, the latest in a series of mock depictions of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign advisers, has one voice saying of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, `` We've got a disaster on our hands.'' Another suggests that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dump <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> from the ticket and `` bring in <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>.'' A second ad hits even harder. It shows photographs of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> being sworn in as accidental presidents while an announcer says one in five vice presidents have been thrust into the presidency. `` After five months of reflection, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his personal choice _ <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' an announcer says. `` Hopefully we will never know how great a lapse of judgment that really was.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> senior adviser <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said both were airing on networks nationally and would run for four or five days. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s assault on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> reflects <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> hopes that reservations about the 41-year-old <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's qualifications, depth and fitness for the job are so great they will overcome historical indicators that suggest a candidate's running mate has little effect on voters' In <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> southern coordinator <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said the ads and the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> issue could be important in states where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are running extremely close with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Campaigning with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> _ a former presidential candidate himself _ described <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> as just such a `` neck-and-neck'' state. `` It's never going to be a killer issue, but as long as it's something they've got to deal with, in a state that's within one or two -LRB- percentage -RRB- points, it can make a difference,'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said

 A weeping <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> pleaded guilty today to six counts of kidnapping in the Feb. 2 takeover of a private school and was sentenced to one life term, plus five 20-year terms. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> clutched a red-bound Bible as Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karrh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION> asked him how he pleaded to each count. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> nodded and said softly, `` Guilty.'' The pleas came in the third day of <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s trial on 110 counts of kidnapping. The other counts were dropped in exchange for his guilty pleas. He could have faced up to 10,000 years in prison. <PERSON> Karrh </PERSON> told <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> his sentences would run concurrently and that he would recommend <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> get psychiatric treatment in the prison system. `` I think you need treatment,'' the judge told <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, who sat in a chair during the sentencing. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> had been charged with kidnapping 110 people at gunpoint at the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> End </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> had been defending himself in state court here as a crusader for people's constitutional rights A second man, described by police as an unwilling accomplice, testified Thursday he was duped by <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> into helping take over the school and later was threatened with his life if he tried to back out. Two of <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s sisters, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>, had met with him last night and today to try to talk him into pleading guilty. `` I begged him to go to prison,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` At least he will have part of his life.''

<TEXT>
 Beneath the surface of the northern Russian landscape, a few miles from ancient churches and grazing cattle, lies the blunt white tip of nuclear destruction. The SS-11 intercontinental missile has not intruded on the outside world in the 15 years or more since it was placed in its silo 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But it retains the power to destroy <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> or any other American city in minutes. `` This missile is on full military standby. It's fully armed,'' Major Gen. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vershkov </PERSON> said Thursday on a trip sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviet decision to show the missile to foreign reporters was unprecedented. `` Your presence here is indeed a step toward trust,'' he said. `` If someone five years ago told me a group of correspondents, including foreign correspondents, would meet me by a missile silo, I would n't have believed it.'' The single-warhead SS-11 is among the oldest of the Soviet strategic forces. Western military references list three types of SS-11s and estimate the Soviets have deployed about 440. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says their range is 6,600 to 8,000 miles, putting any intercontinental target within their reach. The missile is based at what Western analysts call the Teykovo missile range, surrounded by the historic towns of <LOCATION> Suzdal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rostov </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yaroslavl </LOCATION>, whose ancient churches remind one of life centuries before nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Vershkov </PERSON> said residents know only that a military installation is in the area. Soviet military officers said the decision to show the missile was made by the general staff of Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, the Soviet military chief, within days of a reporter's query. The officers said they learned of the visit six days before it began. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> was shown a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Minuteman II missile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this summer. <PERSON> Vershkov </PERSON>, a 49-year-old veteran of Soviet rocket forces, said reporters were shown an SS-11 because it is analogous to the Minuteman II. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have visited more than 100 missile sites while monitoring Soviet compliance with the treaty eliminating medium-and shorter-range missiles, which was ratified in May. `` I would n't have thought we would have gone through 115 inspections, poking into sensitive areas, without some kind of minor tension,'' Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. `` I find the Soviets uncommonly flexible and supportive.'' But <PERSON> Vershkov </PERSON> made clear that many questions about the SS-11 missile, the command center, and the soldiers who man it were forbidden. Reporters were taken to the top of one silo, whose dark green lid about 20 feet square was rolled to one side to uncover the white SS-11 inside, and to an empty silo about nine miles away. They saw the top of the 60-foot missile, but not the command center, which <PERSON> Vershkov </PERSON> said was several miles away. They saw no soldiers except for a small group of top officers. Even officers in the control center do n't know where the missiles are targeted, he said. <PERSON> Vershkov </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member who lavished praise on Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s foreign policy, refused to detail his responsibilities except to say he was a representative of the military command. When a television reporter asked how close a nuclear missile would have to land to destroy the site, he responded, `` Why do your viewers need such details?'' Western references say the first SS-11s were deployed in 1966 and that only about 20 remain. The rest are two later variations, one with a single warhead and one with three warheads, deployed betweeen 1973 and 1975. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators are making slow progress in negotiations to halve their arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons. The general said he and his soldiers would not be upset if the SS-11s were destroyed under a new treaty. `` I'll find work. I have an engineering degree, and the country needs working hands,'' he said. `` We do n't intend to attack or threaten anyone,'' he said. `` I am sure the remaining missiles would ensure defense sufficiency _ but the fewer of them, the better.''

<HEAD>Business Leaders Expect Slowdown In 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's business leaders, enjoying high profits from the strongest economic growth in four years, said Friday they expect a slowdown in 1989. Executives ranging from <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said their industries are generating very strong earnings Nevertheless, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, composed of 62 chief executives of large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations, say they would prefer less robust growth and a `` soft landing'' next year to the alternative: higher inflation, rising interest rates and finally a recession, or a `` hard landing.'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, delivering a consensus report of about 20 economists from member corporations, told executives gathered for their twice-a-year retreat at this mountain resort town to expect growth, as measured by the gross national product, of 4 percent this year, the best since 1984. The panel expects the current economic expansion, now in its 70th month, to continue well into next year, but at a slower rate. It predicted GNP growth of 2.5 percent in 1989 and less than 2 percent in 1990, about in line with what the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> considers non-inflationary. `` I think probably the general consensus would be 2.5 to 3 in the longer term may be more healthy and more sustainable,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. Too much growth, according to economists, leads to shortages of both labor and factory capacity, which in turn leads to higher wages and prices. The sector of the economy expected to slow the most is consumer spending. Increasing sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods abroad and more spending on new machinery by manufacturers striving to meet the export boom should replace consumption as the `` engine'' of the economy. Even executives who depend most heavily on consumer spending, such as <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a major department store chain, welcome the shift because it means fewer foreign imports. `` Retailers have as large a stake in the long-term health of the economy as the manufacturing side,'' <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> said. Soaring personal consumption earlier in the 1980s `` clearly had long-range implications for the economy that were not good.'' Retail management simply needs to plan for slower growth, he said. The executives, however, continue to be troubled about the prospects for reducing the trade and budget deficits. Their economic advisers expect almost no progress through 1990 in shrinking the budget deficit from the 1987 level and expected a 1988 mark of about $ 150 billion. They forsee the trade gap declining from $ 170 billion last year, to $ 134 billion this year and to below $ 100 billion in 1990. But they say that will happen only with further declines in the value of the dollar from the current level of 133 Japanese yen to 120 yen over the next two years. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a health care company, said only the continuing confidence of foreigners in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, based on the past rather than the present, has kept the value of the dollar artificially high. `` I'm persuaded ... that our trading partners and our creditors will not tolerate forever the financial situation we're in. ... Other countries would n't have gotten away this long without their currency weakening a lot more than ours has,'' he said. In other predictions, the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s economists saw: _ Unemployment staying at 6 percent or below through 1990 The rate was 5.4 percent last month, nearly the lowest in 14 years. _ Consumer prices rising 4.2 percent this year and 5.1 percent next year, but no return to the double-digit inflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s _ Average interest rates rising by a bit more than 1 percentage point next year and then easing in 1990 The Business Council, formed in 1933 as an advisory panel to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, selected <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> to serve as its chairman in 1989 and 1990.

<HEAD>Sudan Stops Frontier Locust-Spraying; Blames Ethiopian Attacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> said Friday it has stopped trying to control a locust plague along the Ethiopian border because of military attacks. The defense minister says no one has been hurt in the assaults on villages and spray planes, but he said vehicles were burned in an air attack on a convoy near <LOCATION> Kassala </LOCATION>, 260 miles east of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. He said the government has asked the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> government to stop the attacks. The episode appeared to be a major setback to <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>'s efforts to deal with one of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s worst locust infestations in years. In <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> capital, officials refused comment on the situation. Relations between <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> have been strained for several years, especially since a rebellion broke out in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in 1983. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> of arming, financing and harboring the rebels. <PERSON> Addis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ababa </PERSON> alleges that <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> allows several anti-Ethiopian guerrilla groups to maintain official, open presence in the Sudanese capital. The official <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Syd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, announced the decision to abandon the frontier spraying operation. `` All locust control operations along the Sudanese-Ethiopian borders were completely halted due to the shelling of the pest control areas by the Ethiopian air force,'' the news agency said. It quoted <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> as saying that sprayers and others involved with the program already were withdrawn. Swarms of the crop-devouring insects appeared in several <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries in recent weeks after heavy rains created perfect breeding conditions. In <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, swarms have occurred mainly in the eastern and western regions, but one massive swarm hit crops in the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> area and others are expected. The government committed 22 planes to the spraying operation, but officials say three wo n't fly and one crashed in the western sector. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Issa </PERSON>, minister of state at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told the newspaper Al-Ayam that two Ethiopian MiG jet fighters attacked vehicles assigned to the crop-dusting operation in villages along the border. He said spray planes had come under fire from within <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. The armed forces newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Guwat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Musalaha </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the reports on Thursday. `` The Ethiopian air force intercepted a locust spray convoy last week in the eastern region ... and hit some cars working in the spray operation,'' the newspaper said. `` No one was hurt.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> told Al-Guwat Al-Musalaha the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had relayed <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s demand that <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> `` stop violating Sudanese air space'' so that `` we work together ... to eradicate locusts, which affect all the countries in the region including <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Several thousand demonstrators chanted Islamic slogans after Moslem prayer services today, and authorities reported 900 arrests and an unspecified number of deaths in three days of rioting. Police and troops were blocking the demonstrators, estimated by reporters to number at least 6,000, in the <LOCATION> Belcourt </LOCATION> district in eastern <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. They chanted `` God is Great'' and other slogans and called for establishment of an Islamic republic. Earlier today, Algerians formed long lines for bread after an overnight curfew that was almost universally obeyed. On Thursday, the government declared a national state of emergency and put all police and administrative authorities under the military. Occasional gunshots broke the early morning silence. It was not clear whether the shots were fired at protesters or were warnings to chase away the few people in the streets. Protesters this week have included youths protesting an austerity program that has sharply increased prices, Islamic fundamentalists who oppose the government's secular orientation and rioters whose political stance was not known. The military command said 900 people were arrested in the three previous days and were caught `` red-handed in pillage and vandalism.'' In a separate statement, the command said street battles caused `` losses of human life among the demonstrators as well as in the ranks of the forces of order.'' It said the deaths occurred Thursday during the day and night. It did not say where in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> they happened. More than 30 people seriously injured in the clashes were admitted to <LOCATION> Mustapha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, medical sources said today on condition of anonymity. They said the worst injuries occurred Wednesday night. President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjadid </PERSON> proclaimed a state of emergency on Thursday and ordered a curfew from midnight to 6 a.m. The army was given responsibility for public order for the first time since <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> won independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> 26 years ago. Bakeries were among the few shops open today, as other food stores remained closed either for lack of supplies or for fear of renewed violence. While prices of meats and other goods have soared, bread remains heavily subsidized by the government. Army convoys escorted trucks carrying flour to bakeries early in the morning to assure supplies. `` Getting provisions to the citizens is one of our main concerns, along with security,'' an army officer on one of the escorts told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He declined to give his name. The national airline <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Algerie </ORGANIZATION> announced today it was canceling all its flights, but international airlines continued to operate flights in and out of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>' Houari Boumediene airport. Government offices and other businesses were closed as usual today, the Moslem day of prayer. Former President <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>, who lives in exile in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, was quoted in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION> as saying some people were killed in the disturbances, without specifying how many or providing details. `` It was predictable that young people would rise up against the corruption, the bad management and the total lack of freedom,'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>, who was president from independence in 1962 until he was overthrown in a military coup in 1965, was quoted as saying. The French news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France-Presse </ORGANIZATION> reported that two brothers, aged 14 and 23, were killed in the <LOCATION> El-Biar </LOCATION> neighborhood and quoted a relative as saying she saw their bodies at the <LOCATION> Birtraria </LOCATION> hospital. A hospital official, refusing to identify himself, denied the report today. The protests began last week with a series of strikes in industries _ which are nearly all government-controlled _ as well as the postal and telephone service and Air Algerie. By unofficial estimates, unemployment is above 40 percent in the capital. Under the government's economic reform program, prices for basic food staples other than bread have risen sharply. Slightly more than two pounds of beef sell for $ 25 or more.

 Nine prison inmates who grew marijuana while on work details in a forest were caught trying to smuggle 31 pounds of pot into a state prison work camp, <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said today.

The inmates were charged with manufacturing a controlled substance, possession of more than one ounce of marijuana and supplying contraband, he said.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Denver </PERSON> says he has until Nov. 1 to accept a `` very serious'' invitation to fly aboard a Soviet spacecraft. `` This is not a stunt to me. ...

However, <PERSON> Denver </PERSON> said the Soviets' insistence that he pay $ 10 million for the flight would likely prompt him to drop the project. `` I've told them that I'm opposed to paying $ 10 million, that I think it's inappropriate, that I think it's negative and that it's not the way I want to pursue this endeavor,'' he said Among the Soviet requirements that <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> said he has fulfilled is obtaining permission from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and passing a physical for space flight with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. `` At this point they have a slot open for me, December of next year,'' he said.

<HEAD>80-Year-Old Senator Says He's Fit For Another Term</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> used to offer a karate chop for anyone saying the 80-year-old senator was too old to run for re-election. The karate line is gone, but <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> still argues he's fit despite his advancing age and a recent cancer operation. The 28-year Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> veteran maintains a comfortable lead over Republican opponent <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON>, who argues that the issue is <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>'s `` ability to be a vigorous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator for the next six years.'' `` I'm in good shape,'' counters <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>. `` I'm surprising myself.'' A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> poll taken in late September gave <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> a 57 percent to 32 percent lead over <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON> but indicated that 35 percent of eligible voters were concerned about his mental and physical fitness. Part of <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON>'s problem appears to be his personality. Even people who like the 56-year-old <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader say he's abrasive Some 37 percent of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> view <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON> unfavorably, according to an earlier poll. `` I've taken many stands over the years that have at that moment in time been unpopular,'' said <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON>. `` I'm a fighter. I've always been a fighter. A series of television commercials intended to soften <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON>'s image as an overbearing leader made little difference, and now <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> has started a series of attacks on the Republican's record on farm and social service issues <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON> accuses <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> of dodging face-to-face meetings with him and says a pair of debates later this month, when the senator must speak extemporaneously, will demonstrate whether he has the stamina for another six-year term. So far, though, <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> has kept his distance, saying his work in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where he is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is taking up his time. `` I've got to finish my job down there,'' <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> said in a recent interview at the Bismarck airport. `` I ca n't leave.'' <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> has limited his campaigning primarily to television and has turned down numerous invitations for joint appearances with his challenger. When the two candidates were asked to speak at a meeting of the state's broadcasters, <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON> showed up, but <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> sent his press secretary and a video-taped speech. <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> has been hospitalized twice in the last year, once for a concussion when he slipped on ice last winter and hit his head, and again last summer when doctors removed 18 inches of his intestine after a cancerous polyp was discovered. Several leading Democrats first raised the age issue last year in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to retire, and Republicans have picked up where <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>'s Democratic critics left off. <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON> is pinning his hopes on winning over Democrats and independents who have doubts about <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>'s fitness. `` There's a sizable number of people out there supporting him who really do n't think he should run again,'' said <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON> Some 26 percent of Democrats and 34 percent of independents polled in late September were concerned about his age. `` It still could be an issue, but not the kind of issue that the Strinden campaign hoped that people would hook onto,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmeson </PERSON>, who conducts the UND surveys. After all, this is a state that re-elected 77-year-old <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> in 1974; Young finally retired, at 83. To highlight his own good health, <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON> once held a news conference with his doctor, who told reporters that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate has gained a little weight and drinks too much coffee. <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON> has just $ 120,000 left in the bank after wasting, he says, a similar amount on pre-October commercials, including an $ 8,000 anti-drunken driving campaign. With so little money left, <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON> can not afford to counter the blitz of <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> ads for which he is bracing, he said. <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> has raised more than $ 1 million for his campaign and still has about $ 400,000 left, says <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, his campaign treasurer. <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON> maintains that his campaign was right on track until <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>'s surgery. The operation, from which <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> appeared to recover quickly, won the sympathy of voters and gave him a boost in the polls, <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, who has challenged political opponents to spar with him in a karate match if they doubt his health, started running a vigorous media campaign soon after the 1986 election gave Democrats control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and elevated him to the committee chairmanship. <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> says he will convince voters of his vigor when he gets back to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled to adjourn this weekend. `` They'll see me on TV, they'll see me in person. ... They can see for themselves what shape I'm in,'' he said.

 The new television-ad offensive by Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> against an already aggressive <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is weeks late, campaign watchers say. Still, `` in a campaign as in life, better late than never,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, an author and campaign specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, running slightly behind Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in most polls, started a clutch of negative ads this week, including two that question both the qualifications of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment in choosing him. Each campaign is reported to be spending more than $ 1 million a week on national network television time and more than twice that much for ads on local stations and cable television. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is planning a half-hour program on election eve; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is still weighing options. <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> and other analysts say <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should have been on the attack coming out of the Democratic convention last July, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> first started airing ads criticizing the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's crime and environmental records `` It's always easier to shape attitudes than to reshape them,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> professor and author of three books on presidential campaigns in the TV age. `` These ads would have been much more effective if they had gone on the air six weeks ago.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` wanted to keep this campaign on a positive note talking about the issues. Regrettably, because of the nasty campaign they've been running, we've had to'' go negative. <PERSON> Sig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ad director, countered that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> team is `` groping for ideas. ... Their ad team probably could be equated with the same group given the task of selling the Edsel. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people just are n't going to buy it.'' <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> and others have compared the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ad effort unfavorably to the hard-hitting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategy devised by <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has recently introduced tough ads attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' prison furlough program, tax policies and other aspects of his record as governor. <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> indicated the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp's remaining advertising would build on the new get-tough attitude. `` There is definitely a unified ad campaign that is planned,'' he said. `` So fasten your seat belts. It's going to be a bumpy ride.'' The new approach apparently bears the stamp of the candidate. Asked in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> if he had seen the new anti-Quayle ads his campaign is running, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied, `` Are you kidding me? Nothing goes on around here without me knowing.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> team kicked into high gear early this week with a nationally aired `` Packaging of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' series in which actors playing cynical <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> handlers moan about how to disguise their candidate's alleged weaknesses on the environment, drugs, crime and health matters. The `` packaging'' series was joined several days later by a set of four ads hitting the vice president's record on drugs, the environment, Social Security and education. A narrator derides <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s record on each issue and asks viewers if they really believe he has converted to the cause. One of the Quayle ads shows scenes of vice presidents <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> taking their presidential oaths as a narrator says one in five vice presidents has risen directly to the presidency. `` For this job, after five months of reflection, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his personal choice _ <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' the ad says. `` Hopefully, we will never know how great a lapse of judgment that really was.'' The other ad, part of the `` packaging'' series, shows the actor-handlers depressed about the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's debate showing against the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` We've got a disaster on our hands,'' one handler says. `` Suddenly the words ` President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>' even make me nervous,'' says another. `` Is it too late to drop him?'' asks a third. `` Bring in <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went on national television this week with an ad reiterating his soft-on-criminals charge against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The spot says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed the death penalty and mandatory sentences for drug dealers, and charges a `` revolving door'' prison furlough program let out murderers who are still at large. Another, in spot markets around the country, accuses <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of imposing `` the largest tax increase in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> history'' and spending `` at a greater per capita rate than any other governor in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Both spots end, `` And now he wants to do for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> what he's done for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ca n't afford that risk.'' Another spot ad features complaints about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents, according to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advertising aide <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>. `` We got them off the street, literally,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should be called <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Taxakakis </PERSON>,'' a man says. `` I'm a Democrat. I've never voted Republican before, but this time I'm voting for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' says a woman. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign wo n't discuss its TV spending, but the opposition reports that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has bought or plans to spend $ 1.2 million to $ 1.5 million on national network time for each week up to the election, and spent $ 2.5 million on local and cable outlets this week. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign says its spending is comparable to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> outlay.

<HEAD>Groundwater Quality Said Generally Good</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nation's groundwater will appear more contaminated in coming years simply because more people are looking for contamination, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Although evidence is insufficient to show whether contamination is getting worse, groundwater quality is generally good, the agency said. Groundwater provides drinking water for 53 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population _ 97 percent in rural areas _ and accounts for 40 percent of the flow in the nation's streams. Contamination has attracted increasing concern in recent years, and the survey devoted its annual water report for 1986, released only Friday, to groundwater quality. Survey spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> said `` printing problems'' had delayed the report. All states reported contamination from both natural and human sources. In its report for 1984, the survey reported worrisome contamination of groundwater by nitrate compounds, with nearly 20 percent of sampled wells showing evidence of nitrate additions from human activity and 6 percent exceeding recommended maximum concentrations. The data came not from a statistical sample, but rather a search of files for the previous 25 years, and the percentages would not necessarily apply to the nation's groundwater supply as a whole. A special study ofencies, the extent of groundwater contamination is likely to appear to increase over the next few years because more agencies will be searching for evidence of contamination, and they will be using increasingly sensitive analytical procedures.''' Groundwater moves slowly, only a few feet per year at most, so contamination can take years to show up in wells near a pollution site. In some instances, officials said, remedial measures may be cleaning the shallower parts of an aquifer even while contamination is still penetrating to the deeper parts.

<HEAD>AIDS Not `Exploding' among Heterosexuals, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 AIDS is not `` exploding'' among the nation's heterosexuals, public health experts said in a report Friday, but one researcher warned it's going to be a bigger problem for the general public than many think The report in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the number of reported heterosexual AIDS cases is doubling every 14 to 16 months, keeping pace with infection rates among homosexuals and intravenous drug abusers. `` Although AIDS is not ` exploding' into the heterosexual population relative to other risk groups, the increase in the number of heterosexual cases is proportional to increases in other risk groups,'' the report said. Heterosexual spread of the deadly disease appears to be more of a problem among blacks than whites, the researchers noted. About 4 percent of the 59,287 cases of AIDS reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> between June 1981 and April 11, 1988, are listed as heterosexually transmitted, according to the report. Blacks accounted for 69 percent of the 2,392 AIDS cases attributed to heterosexual contact, whites accounted for 17 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Hispanics </ORGANIZATION> 14 percent, the report said. A co-author, Dr. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haverkos </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said a higher rate of drug abuse among blacks might be a major factor in the increased frequency of heterosexually transmitted AIDS among blacks. The report said intravenous drug abuse is `` an important link'' in the heterosexual spread of AIDS, with 61 percent of U.S.-born heterosexual AIDS patients reporting sexual contact with an IV drug abuser. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which cripples the immune system, is spread through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. `` Heterosexual spread of AIDS is going to be a bigger problem than many people in this country up until now have suggested,'' <PERSON> Haverkos </PERSON> cautioned. `` The medical community and the public should be aware of this and start developing ways to minimize transmission.'' The report reiterated that condoms offer the best protection outside of abstinence to prevent the spread of AIDS, and it recommended counseling for people infected with the virus to keep them from spreading it to sex partners. Dr. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> <PERSON> Handsfield </PERSON>, director of the Sexually Transmitted Disease Control Program for the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle-King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he basically agreed with the report's findings, but felt the authors somewhat overstated the potential problem of heterosexual AIDS cases. `` We clearly should prepare for the worst, but at the same time the average heterosexual who is not being sexually active in an environment of drug abuse is currently at a very low risk'' of becoming infected, <PERSON> Handsfield </PERSON> said. A letter from three doctors at the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Division of Health in Madison appearing in the JAMA issue criticized a method used in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to control heterosexual transmission _ mandatory premarital testing for the AIDS, or HIV, virus _ as ineffective. The mandatory <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> testing program spotted only five HIV-positive people after testing nearly 45,000 marriage license applicants during the first four months of 1988, according to Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Belongia </PERSON> and his colleagues.

<HEAD>Clock Runs Out on Child Care, Family Leave Legislation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A package of family bills offering child care assistance and parental job leaves died Friday in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, a casualty of political pressures and the ticking clock of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. With adjournment expected next week and at least two major bills still pending, sponsors of the legislation failed to get the 60 votes they needed to restrict debate and get on with their bill. The vote was 50-46. The triple-pronged package _ which also included a crackdown on child pornographers _ was on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for the better part of two weeks amid intense political and parliamentary maneuvering. Democrats repeatedly termed the package an opportunity to back up election campaign rhetoric with a solid commitment. Republicans said there were more pressing matters to deal with, such as drug and tax bills, and they refused to offer amendments or strike a compromise on the family measures. `` Their filibuster was successful. They have won today and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s families have lost,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said after the Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had acted prudently. `` What we've done in effect is say slow down,'' he said. `` This is n't an urgent measure that needs to be passed in the waning days of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., who led the drive for the package, accused Republicans of waging `` a filibuster by silence; nine days of stalling; nine days of total inertia. `` Never in the history of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics has there been a constituency so popular but with so little political clout as the American family,'' said <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on children, family, drugs and alcoholism. He said he would re-introduce the parental leave and child care bills on the first day of the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in January. The three elements of the family package included: _ <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s original bill requiring employers of over 50 people to offer workers at least 10 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave when they have newborn, newly adopted or sick children, or have serious medical problems themselves _ An anti-pornography measure sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, making it a federal crime to possess, sell or distribute child pornography or obscene materials It was added to the parental leave bill on a unanimous vote. _ The $ 2.5 billion Act for <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, also sponsored by <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, aimed at helping low-income parents pay for child care at centers or homes It was presented as a compromise between <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, and was to have included a tax credit for poor families in its final form. There remains considerable controversy over the bill's treatment of religious groups providing day care, and over a requirement that day care providers receiving federal money meet minimum federal standards of health and safety, staff training and staff-to-children ratios. The parental-leave section was fought vigorously by business and conservative groups. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- debate focused on whether the private sector rather than <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is best equipped to decide and manage benefit policy. It was n't a debate on whether or not parental or medical leave is a good benefit,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavenner </PERSON>, founder of a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employers </ORGANIZATION>. Groups that back the Dodd bills, representing unions, churches, women, children and medical personnel, vowed to press ahead next year. `` We're going to be back early so we're first on the agenda instead of last in the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtman </PERSON>, executive director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund. `` People are going to be angry that there's been such a high level of rhetoric and so little produced,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Colo </LOCATION>., sponsor of the parental leave bill in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` We'll be back stronger. It's not the end. It's the beginning.''

She began at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Feb. 14, 1944, thinking a year or so as a flight attendant would be a good `` finishing school.'' Her tenure ended with Miss <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> working 11,000 flights, serving 1.2 million meals and flying 22 million miles. She kept her original uniform size. Her first flights with Eastern were in 21-passenger DC-3s with non-pressurized cabins, no air conditioning and often no heat. `` I would give baldheaded men pillows to put on their heads so they would n't get too cold,'' she said. And then there was the time during her DC-3 days when frogs bound for a research facility escaped and `` kind of produced some festivity in the cabin.''

<HEAD>Marathon Trial Ends With Homeowners Winning Over Leaky Pipes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Nearly 100 homeowners with leaky pipes have been awarded up to $ 7 million in damages from the four companies that made and installed the plumbing, ending a marathon trial that produced a 4,465-page verdict. The state jury Thursday sided with 94 <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Porte </ORGANIZATION> homeowners who had sued <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, which built the houses, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst-Celanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which produced and marketed the plumbing materials. Ending a trial that began in June, the jury found that the four companies were negligent and misrepresented the quality of the plumbing. The plumbing apparently failed in many of the <LOCATION> Fairmount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> subdivision homes after about four years because of contact with chemicals, primarily chlorine, found in water, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON>, an attorney for the homeowners. <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON> said the verdict, which addressed each claim on a separate sheet of paper, was the first against the companies responsible for the polybutylene plumbing system. Six similar suits are pending in <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courts, he said. <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON> said the jury awarded each homeowner about $ 40,000 to $ 70,000 in damages, interest and fees, but the final amount depends on whether Judge <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevathan </PERSON> affirms the panel's finding of deceptive trade practices. He said the plumbing system was taken off the market in 1986.

<HEAD>Israel Gives Hundreds Polio Boosters After Outbreak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REHOVOT, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of children were vaccinated against polio Friday in the first stage of a nationwide campaign to immunize all Israelis up to the age of 40 against the disease. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> ordered the campaign after nine Israelis were infected by polio, which causes muscular paralysis. In the next four weeks, about 3.2 million people will be vaccinated, said ministry spokesman <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Algrabli </PERSON>. Israelis are immunized as children, and the current vaccination is a booster. The first stage of the campaign centered on the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Rehovot </LOCATION> and the northern coastal town of Acco. Polio viruses were found in the sewage systems of both areas. In <LOCATION> Rehovot </LOCATION>, hundreds of parents lined up at clinics with their infants. Large yellow wall posters informed residents when different age groups should report for vaccinations. The Tourism Ministry expressed concern that reports of the disease would keep visitors away from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Tourism has dropped dramatically since the Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began Dec. 8. But Health Ministry officials have stressed visitors do not need extra vaccinations before visiting the country because the outbreak is limited. No cases of polio were reported in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last year, and the recent cases have been blamed on overflowing sewage. The government initially decided to give booster vaccinations only to residents of affected areas, but changed its policy Thursday following recommendations by a team of international health experts. Military officials said they would decide Sunday whether to administer booster shots to Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. No such program is considered in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Palestinians in the occupied lands have routinely received the combined Sabin-Salk vaccine, which is more effective than the single vaccination administered in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The stronger vaccine was given to counter often substandard sanitary conditions in the occupied territories, such as open sewage systems. `` The general situation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> is very good, but since the vaccinations are being done in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> we may administer boosters,'' said <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafowicz </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military government.

 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, wife of Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, will join celebrities Saturday reading the names of AIDS victims memorialized in a 750-by-500-foot quilt to be laid out on the Elipse behind the White House. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Minor </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> native who made 20 of the quilts 8,288 panels in memory of friends who died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has helped the anti-AIDS movement in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> where the quilt project is based and participated in a program to take meals to AIDS victims. Others among the 495 people scheduled to read names of victims are actresses <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> McClaine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass. The framework for the display, complete with 16 miles of canvas walkway to allow an expected 250,000 spectators a closer view of the quilt's panels, was laid out Friday. Each panel is 3-feet by 6-feet. Saturday's program, scheduled to begin at sunrise with the reading of the first set of 32 names as the panels are being laid out, is expected to last 11 hours, according to NAMES Project spokesman <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauro </PERSON>. Many of the volunteers became involved with the project after a friend died of the disease. One group from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> is selling `` travel kits'' of aspirin, condoms, safe sex pamphlets and combs. The travel kits, t-shirts, posters and a book about the life stories behind the panels are among items being sold to defray the costs of bringing the massive display to the capital. Panels not on the Elipse will be on display around the city at various AIDS support group centers. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, across the street from the quilt, has an exhibit of photographs of AIDS victims. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>, who managed a 20-city tour for the quilt, expected the reaction to the display, which is now the size of four football fields, to be similar to what it received on the tour. `` It was incredible,'' she said. `` There was such an outpouring of relief, of pain. Especially when we went to cities like <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, the really sheltered places where -LRB- friends and relatives of AIDS victims -RRB- are so alone. You have a place to go, to carry your grief.'' Former actor <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, who has AIDS, agreed that the quilt offers a chance to humanize the statistics. But he said it provokes a number of emotions, including anger. `` There would n't have to be a quilt if there would have been government intervention,'' he said. `` It is now up to the people to realize that it is no longer and never really has been just the a gay community dying from AIDS.''

<HEAD>Jobless Rate Dips to 5.4 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's unemployment rate in September fell back to July's level of 5.4 percent, but with the loss of 37,000 factory jobs in the meantime, the government said Friday. Employers added 255,000 new jobs to their payrolls last month, sending the number of unemployed workers down by a like figure to 6,596,000, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The unemployment total was the lowest it has been since June, when the jobless rate hit a 14-year-low 5.3 percent. But more than 100,000 of the new jobs were an unusually high number of teachers returning to the classroom. Payroll growth in the private sector has averaged only 120,000 new jobs in each of the past two months, compared with average monthly gains of 300,000 in the first half of 1988. The 0.2 percentage point drop in the September jobless rate directly offset an increase of the same size, to 5.6 percent, in August. Analysts said the figures indicate a continuing trend of slower economic growth _ just what financial markets nervous about an overheating economy and inflation wanted _ going into next month's presidential election `` If you were -LRB- Republican nominee -RRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, I do n't think you could have written a better set of numbers,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> called the loss of 18,000 factory jobs last month following a similar drop of 19,000 in August a concern but added: `` If you're a Republican, you avoid the details and look at the big picture. That's just what President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did, citing the figures in a campaign rally for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> as evidence that `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economy is a Grand Prix racer. However, there was other evidence in Friday's report that the job picture is not as <PERSON> rosey </PERSON> as it appears at first glance. Construction employment was flat and oil and gas industry rosters fell for the second month in a row. Together with assembly-line employment growth, they had been providing an average 65,000 new jobs a month from January through July. Employment growth in business services such as data processing that has provided a large chunk of the job gains in the 6-year-long economic recovery also has slowed to a trickle the past two months, the government said. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, commissioner of labor statistics, told the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that as many industries lost jobs last month as gained them, the first time that has occurred in more than two years. Citing an unusual monthly drop of 107,000 people in the labor force, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishel </PERSON>, an economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal think tank financed largely by labor unions, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` are getting lucky on the demographics.'' `` The whole reason why <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been able to achieve low unemployment rates is that the population growth slowed by a third in the 1980s,'' <PERSON> Mishel </PERSON> said. `` President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had the Baby Boom coming into the labor market and had to create a lot more jobs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has enjoyed the effects of the Baby Bust.'' Economists said they did not expect government economic reports due to be released before the Nov. 8 election to help Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm based in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, predicted that the employment, inflation and trade figures all will paint a rosy economy. `` He's not going to get any help from the raw employment figures,'' <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` If he's going to win on economics, it's going to have to come from convincing people there's a problem ahead of us.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly has focused on the creation of some 15 million new jobs under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration since the end of the 1981-82 recession, which had sent the jobless rate into double digits. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has countered that the issue is not the number of new jobs being created, but the quality of those jobs. He has emphasized that hourly wages after adjustments for inflation have fallen since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> assumed office in 1981. August figures on inflation and average wages bolstered that argument. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that real hourly earnings in terms of purchasing power dropped 1.3 percent during the month, the worst decline since the government began collecting such figures in 1964. The department said average hourly wages rose one-half percentage point, or five cents, in September to $ 9.37 after remaining flat in July and August. Over the past year, nominal hourly wages have risen at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, compared with an inflation rate of 4 percent as measured by consumer prices.

 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that it has suspended <ORGANIZATION> Recognition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from bidding on contracts, pending outcome of a criminal case against the company and two of its top executives. REI, Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and vice president <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> were indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in connection with an unsuccessful plot to rig bids on $ 400 million worth of postal automation contracts. Assistant Postmaster General <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Davin </PERSON>, in charge of procurement, announced the suspension, which bans the company and its subsidiaries from bidding on postal contracts for 120 days, and can be extended pending resolution of the charges against the company. Several relatively small contracts the company and its subsidiaries currently have with the postal service will not be affected, but can not be expanded or renewed. According to the indictment, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company's unsuccessful effort was allegedly engineered in 1986 with the help of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>, vice-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s Board of Governors.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> will use the pulpit of three international institutions to advance his view of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at a time when the region is divided about its future political identity. On a four-day trip to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> that starts Saturday, the pope will speak to the Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, all in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>. The agreement by Common Market countries to fully integrate their economies in 1992 has touched off widespread debate about whether <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should move toward becoming a single political unit. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> raised a storm of protest last month when she declared that a U.S.-style European union would be `` highly damaging'' to the individual states. Several European countries and Common Market organs charged that her comments were a roadblock to a long-desired goal of unity. Against the backdrop of this debate, the Polish-born <PERSON> pope </PERSON> is expected to elaborate on his own vision of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ one united by Christianity and stretching `` from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the Urals.'' A <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official said the pope wanted to address the three international institutions because they pondered the direction of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I think he -LRB- the pope -RRB- feels very strongly that in the process of reflection on the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the church's voice should be there,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has expounded on the theme several times. In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1982, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to return to the Christian principles that tied it together as in medieval days. `` You can still be the beacon of civilization and stimulate progress throughout the world,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> the next year, he said Christianity had formed the basis for political systems built on respect for human rights. The pope felt so strongly about a common European heritage that he released an encyclical in 1985 honoring two ninth century saints who brought Christianity to the Slavs. In <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s view, Saints <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Methodius </ORGANIZATION> forged a link between the Eastern Orthodox and Western Roman Catholic traditions. `` Part of his reflection on the Christian roots of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is to encourage a revival of Christianity,'' the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official said. The pope has expressed particular concern about the church in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Although over 80 percent of French citizens are Roman Catholics, less than 20 percent attend Mass, according to French public opinion polls. This trip, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s fourth to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, will include visits to the dioceses of <ORGANIZATION> Metz </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mulhouse </LOCATION> in the northeast near <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In addition, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will salute <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> on its 2,000 th birthday The city, which changed hands between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for centuries, has a blend of cultures that has attracted groups promoting <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> unity. The Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, composed of 21 parliamentary democracies, aims to coordinate European legislation through accords. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> hears alleged violations of the Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s main treaty, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Seventy-five years ago Friday, in a small factory in <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> put in motion an industrial revolution. On that day, the first Model T moved through an assembly line, towed by a rope. Although the technology has been updated, the assembly line lives on. `` Indeed, what happened in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> transformed the entire nature of the 20th century, perhaps more than any other development except the atomic bomb,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hounshell </PERSON>, a history professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION>. `` The revolution was the installation and elaboration of the moving assembly line,'' he said Friday at a ceremony at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> assembly plant, 20 miles from the factory where <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> made _ and history Actually, use of an assembly line began a few months before Oct. 7, 1913, <PERSON> Hounshell </PERSON> said. Someone in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s flywheel-magneto assembly area decided to keep workers stationary and the product moving. The technique spread to other component operations. `` This was the granddaddy of all assembly lines, the line one imagines when one hears the words ` assembly line,''' <PERSON> Hounshell </PERSON> said. `` Its success _ raising the productivity of final assembly _ was overwhelming. `` By the early 1920s, many household appliances such as vacuum cleaners and even radios were assembled on an assembly line.'' On Friday, another Model T rolled off an assembly line, this one with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s great-grandson, <ORGANIZATION> Edsel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> II, at the wheel. `` At <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, many of our goals today are the same as they were in my great-grandfather's time _ to meet consumers' needs by producing affordable, high-quality vehicles that represent good value for the money,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. Not all workers were enamored with the assembly line in late 1913. There was high employee turnover and talk of work stoppages _ until <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> in 1914 announced he would pay workers the then-incredible sum of $ 5 per day. Within a year, the winch-and-rope system that drew the first Model T through the plant was replaced by a chain. With other manufacturing improvements, production time continued to drop, as did the cost of the vehicle.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Strikes Down EPA Policy on Labeling of Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court on Friday struck down an <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> policy not to list used oil collected for recyling as hazardous waste. At issue was <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in 1986 that a hazardous-waste designation would only create a stigma and discourage many locations such as gasoline stations from collecting used oil for recycling. But a three-judge panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here said that factor can not be taken into account, particularly when <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had already concluded that a broad category of used oils were hazardous wastes. `` The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> erroneously based its decision not to list recycled oils as hazardous wastes on the stigmatic effects of such a listing, a factor not permitted by the statute,'' the court said. It ordered <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to determine if recycled oils `` meet the technical criteria for listing'' as hazardous wastes. `` I would consider this a major victory'' to clean up `` billions of gallons of used oil,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. She predicted that the court's decision will force <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to declare broad categories of used oil hazardous wastes because the agency's own studies have documented that it contains many toxic chemicals. `` The court's action should force <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to stop the dumping of waste oil into municipal landfills and lead to better treatment an reclamation of the oil,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON>, general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Hazardous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The decision `` means <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> should be more concerned about the stigma of harm to the environment than the stigma of calling recycled oil a hazardous waste,'' said Case, whose organization represents large waste-disposal companies. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> attorney, said the court ruling `` arguably leaves a lot of discretion to the agency to determine whether certain oils are hazardous.'' She said the agency was studying the ruling and had not decided how to proceed. In 1985, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> proposed to list a broad category of used automotive and industrial oils as hazardous wastes. But it backed off in 1986, after receiving nearly 800 comments from gasoline dealers and other recyclers. The agency deferred any decision on used oil generally but decided not to list oil collected for recycling as hazardous waste. `` The effect of listing would create such a stigma in the used oil recycling industry that many recycling sources woudl simply refuse to take used oil,'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> decided that `` the used oil might then be diverted to less environmentally sound management options such as throwing it down the sewer,'' she said. The appeals court said `` EPA's concern over the possible adverse environmental consequences of listing used oil may well be warranted,'' but such views `` can not override the intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> clearly expressed in the language and structure of the statute.'' `` It is the agency's obligation to comply with the dictates of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and ours to enforce them,'' a three-judge panel said in an opinion by Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> that was joined by Judges <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Re </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` carefully separated the listing decision from the resultant regulatory decisions,'' <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> wrote, and a 1985 law enacted to prod <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to take action `` simply requires the agency to determine whether to list used oil as hazardous.'' `` Only after the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> decides to list does the statute permit it to consider the effect of its regulations on recycling,'' he wrote. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 1.2 billion gallons of used oil is produced annually, but only half is recycled, said <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, another attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` The laundry list of substances that have been found in used oil is alarming,'' she said. These include benzene, <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> and heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and chromium. In a separate opinion issued Friday, the appeals court panel upheld <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s rules governing the burning of hazardous waste and used oil.

 In an area of <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> dotted with monuments, a small group of journalists and retired journalists gathered Friday to remember colleagues who were killed covering wars. `` The names are too many to mention, and to mention one without the others would n't be fair,'' said <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> <PERSON> Beech </PERSON>, who covered World War II, the Korean War and the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` We all knew who they were and what they stood for.''

 Veteran politicians who rose to prominence before Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power 15 years ago dominate the field of potential candidates for a presidential election next year. In the opposition, which includes parties from the left to the center-right, a few younger leaders who made important contributions to the fight against the authoritarian president also are among possible nominees. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72, would be the top contender on the right if he decides to run. The constitution allows him to be a candidate, but he has not announced his plans. On Wednesday, Chileans voted in a referendum to reject <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s bid to extend his rule until 1997, clearing the way for an election in December 1989. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, moderate politicians who led the opposition campaign for the referendum, are the strongest contenders in the opposition. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest, is a seasoned politican and former senator who played a key role in the tumultuous days before the 1973 coup in which <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> toppled the elected government of <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allende </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> was the main spokesman for the 16-party coalition that campaigned against <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in the referendum, and he received more publicity than most of his peers. In a massively attended final campaign rally, he delivered a forceful and eloquent speech that showed his oratory skills. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a 67-year-old law professor, is more widely accepted by conservative sectors than <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> and other prominent opposition leaders. <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>, 50, a moderate socialist economist and lawyer, is a relative newcomer to politics. He was catapulted to national prominence by his dramatic performance in a campaign television debate. In the debate, the charismatic, tough-talking <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> challenged <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> personally, staring into the camera and shaking his finger. Never before during <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s rule had television shown such a scene. But many consider <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>' socialist ideas and his connections with the Allende government offensive to center-right groups in the opposition. <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> was a middle-ranking official for the Allende administration. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> have denied any presidential ambitions and said the opposition needs an all-out effort to agree on a single candidate to lead a `` government of national unity'' after <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. `` It's too early to talk about candidates,'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said Thursday in his first news conference after the opposition victory. <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>, asked Friday about his possible presidential candidacy, replied: `` Is there going to be an election now? As far as I know, <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is still pretty much alive and well.'' Many observers think <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> would have a better chance at nomination, especially if the opposition succeeds with plans to create a four-year transition government. <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>' comparative youth gives him the option of waiting until a later election. Other dissident figures mentioned as potential candidates include <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdes </PERSON>, 66, and <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON>, 52. Both held Cabinet posts in the government of former president <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Frei </PERSON> in the 1960s, but they gained additional prominence in the years of opposition to <LOCATION> Pinochet </LOCATION>. The only civilian with prominence anywhere near <LOCATION> Pinochet </LOCATION>'s is <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Onofre </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarpa </PERSON>, a 67-year-old landowner and former senator with a reputation of being as fiercily anti-communist as <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. Few doubt that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself could be nominated. Despite his defeat in the referendum, he still won 43 percent of the vote. `` He is the most important political figure in the country,'' said Interior Minister <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. `` Few leaders in the world would be able to get such an extrordinary vote after 15 years in power.''

 About 10,000 people chanting `` You betrayed the people!'' demanded the resignation of local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders Friday in a march on a <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> republic's parliament, <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio reported In <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the ruling Politburo issued a statement promising high-level personnel changes and the introduction of radical market-oriented economic reform in an effort to stem three months of unrest over economic and ethnic issues. The street rally in <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION>, in the republic of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, began after 1,000 construction workers stopped work to protest low wages and falling living standards, the radio report said. About 10,000 protesters then marched to the legislature, the radio said. Demonstrations also broke out in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> and in the city of <LOCATION> Krusevac </LOCATION>, the radio said. The protests came a day after an estimated 30,000 protesters stormed a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters and forced the resignation of party leaders in the autonomous province of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, in the Serbian republic. Serbian nationalists have led most recent protests, but the rallies are driven also by an economic crisis that has inflation at 217 percent, the foreign debt at $ 21 billion and unemployment at 15 percent. Friday's statement by the Politburo promised `` to make necessary personnel changes'' in an Oct. 17 meeting of the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` which should contribute to the more efficient work of that organ.'' The statement, carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency, also called for the introduction of a radical market-oriented economic reform next year. In a recent interview, Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> mentioned a major reform of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s mixed economy. The reform, scheduled to be adopted Nov. 29 in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, will introduce more private businesses, allow majority foreign ownership of businesses and close or sell off money-losing state companies. The statement also promised a major reduction in government but did not elaborate. In <LOCATION> Krusevac </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, several thousand workers demonstrated to demand higher wages and the ouster of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders, the radio said. In <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, 400 high school students from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> marched on the national <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, chanting that the mainly Christian Serbs will never give up power in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, an autonomous province bordering <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. Mainly Moslem ethnic Albanians now make up 90 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s population. The teen-agers, joined by <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> students, protested alleged harassment by Albanians. They were met at <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> by Vice President <PERSON> Spasoje </PERSON> <PERSON> Medenica </PERSON>, who listened to their grievances before they dispersed, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. Several dozen Communist party leaders have been attacked by name in recent rallies by Serbs. After the resignation of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> province's 15 Politburo members, the largely <ORGANIZATION> Albanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party leadership in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is expected to come under pressure to make sweeping changes at a meeting it holds Oct. 13. The resignations in <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> were a major victory for <ORGANIZATION> Serbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who wants more control over the two provinces. The Serbian leader's opponents suspect he is using the mass rallies to gain more national power for himself and for <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the largest of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics. Many Serbs see <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> as political heir to the late President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, who died in 1980 and left the nation with a complex system of annual rotation in the occupants of top political offices. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s advance alarms many politicians in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s other republics

 A mercenary shot down in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> flying supplies to the Contras is suing Iran-Contra figures <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> for $ 135 million, saying they misled the crew and abandoned him during three months of captivity. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Marinette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, also sued <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, a shadowy, CIA-linked cargo airline, and <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which he identified as a shell company owned by <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and controlled by <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Thale </PERSON> denied Friday any connection with <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON>. The suit claimed the company paid his expenses. <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> filed a similar suit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> federal court in May, but jurisdiction questions are pending there because the planes allegedly flew out of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> are based. <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON>' plane was shot down over <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1986. He parachuted to safety, but three crewmen died. <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> was tried by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and sentenced to 30 years in prison, then sent back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after three months. <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON>, said they were told the supply operation was a patriotic mission, but later found out <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> were profiting from the deal. He also said <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> promised help when he was captured, but never delivered. `` This guy was captured by the Sandinistas,'' said <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> `` What did he expect, that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military would step in and save him?'' The suit, filed Tuesday in federal court, says that <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> was recruited in 1986 through <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> pilot. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who later died in the crash, led <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> to believe `` the Contra resupply operation was being run ` right out of the back door of the White House''' by <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, the suit said. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general, are accused with former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> figures <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> of conspiring to defraud the government by diverting proceeds from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales to the Contras at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels. <PERSON> Thale </PERSON> denied any relationship between <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, although <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> records in 1986 listed them at the same address.

 The director general of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> pledged Friday to revamp the organization's communications programs so the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will return to the world body they accused of being anti-Western. <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>'s role as a forum for attitudes such as restrictions on press freedom prompted the two countries to resign from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> left at the end of 1984 and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> left in 1985. They accused Mayor's predecessor, <PERSON> Amadou </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahtar </PERSON> <PERSON> M'Bow </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, of an anti-Western bias. `` Frankly, I consider that the problem ... was not mismanagement and the other reasons given but was mainly related to programs, particularly the communications program,'' <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> said. The Spanish biochemist, who took over as head of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> 11 months ago, told a news conference that a new communications program he was preparing would try to overcome controversies that have dogged the organization for more than a decade. `` This is a house of freedom, and we can never go against our constitution which says we guarantee a free flow of information,'' <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> said. He said he rejected the concept of a `` new world information order'' promoted by Third World and Soviet bloc nations. Mayor also said he could not accept proposals made in the past at <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> that critics said could lead to licensing of journalists. Asked whether he was retreating from <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> resolutions that call for a better balance in the flow of information between industrialized nations and the Third World, <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> said providing equipment and training for people in communications, and not just journalists, was the best way to arrive at a more balanced situation. He has proposed that <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> establish a satellite network for education, report on the state of the environment annually and educate youths on the dangers of using drugs to improve athletic performance. Third World countries have long complained that the industralized nations dominate the flow of information. Under <PERSON> M'Bow </PERSON> they joined up with the Soviet bloc to seek ways to control the press by establishing the new information order. <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> said the new communications program will be submitted to the governing <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which meets next week to plan for the 1990s. <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> said he was working hard to get the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to rejoin because without them the organization was `` mutilated.'' <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> also has withdrawn from <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have said it will be at least 1990 before they will consider returning to <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>. Between them they provided 30 percent of the budget for the 158-nation body. Mayor was in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> earlier in the week lobbying for its return and plans a similar trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in December.

 A group of 501 Kurdish refugees returned to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> voluntarily on Friday, two months after they fled and claimed that Iraqi forces dropped chemical bombs on their settlements. Regional Gov. <PERSON> Hayri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozakcioglu </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the Kurdish refugees, the second group to return, were transferred to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> from a southeastern border post in <LOCATION> Habur </LOCATION>. A group of 969 Kurdish refugees returned to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The two groups were among 60,000 Kurds who were settled in five tent cities in southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in August after they left <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. At the urging of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> proclaimed an amnesty for the Kurds. Before the first group returned, only two Kurds had taken advantage of the amnesty. The second group of Kurds was granted special status because the amnesty expired Thursday night, a Turkish government official said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Kozakcioglu </PERSON> said some of the refugees at <LOCATION> Diyarbakir </LOCATION> tent city threw stones at the returnees Friday and tried to keep them from leaving. He said they called the returnees traitors and `` spies of the Iraqi regime.'' Police fired in the air and firefighters shot water to disperse the crowd. <PERSON> Kozakcioglu </PERSON> said two policemen and four Kurds were slightly injured. The Kurds traveled for 20 hours on buses and open trucks to the border. The government said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> gave assurances that the refugees would be safely settled in their villages. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> initially asked the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to supervise the return, but the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> declined after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> refused to grant its request for further guarantees on behalf of the refugees. The Kurds, 20 million people living in a region where borders of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> converge, have been fighting for independence for the past century. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> stepped up attacks on the Kurds soon after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to a cease-fire in their eight-year war on Aug. 20. Security forces in the southeastern township of Uludere killed two Kurdish guerrillas in a clash, the regional governor's office said. The statement, carried by the semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said authorities told rebels to surrender and the guerrillas opened fire on Thursday. It said one guerrilla was captured. The suspects were responsible for killing a policeman and a village guard and wounding three soldiers in three different attacks. The guerrillas were believed to be members of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to set up a Marxist state in parts of eastern and southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. More than 900 civilians and security personnel and an equal number of insurgents have been killed since the rebels started hit-and-run attacks in 1984, official reports say. Kurds make up about one-fifth of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s population of 52 million.

 The judge accused in a scheme by former Miss America <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> to fix her lover's divorce took an unusual personal interest in the case, even after it moved to a higher court, a witness said Friday. In testimony at the trial of Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>; her lover, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, and state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s former law secretary detailed how the judge deviated from her routine in handling <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s divorce. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>'s trial-level court. But under cross examination, the former law secretary, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON>, conceded that while he disagreed with his boss's handling of the <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> case, determining support payments is `` an art not a science. Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> is accused of cutting <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s support payments to his estranged wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, in 1983, in exchange for Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> giving a city job to the judge's daughter. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> at the time was city cultural affairs commissioner. When Mrs. <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> appealed Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s ruling, <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> said the judge asked him to obtain copies of the appeal documents some time before the higher court ruled. The appeals court restored the higher payments. <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> testified that it was the first time Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> made such a request even though hundreds of her decisions were appealed during the six years he worked for her. Previously, <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> testified that in June 1983 Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> to pay his wife $ 1,850 a week but reduced that to $ 680 a week in September. During that summer, said <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON>, Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> _ often using an alias _ called Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> many times on a private line in the judge's chambers. He also said Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> personally drafted her ruling in the <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> case, one of the few times she did so in 3,700 court motions.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim Responsibility for Grenade Attack on Legislature</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leftist rebels claimed responsibility Friday for a rocket-propelled grenade attack on the national legislature, which they called `` the lair of the corrupt.'' Radio Venceremos, the guerrillas' clandestine station, said the Thursday attack, which damaged a wall but caused no injuries, was an operation dubbed `` Armed with bazookas, the people will triumph.'' A projectile fired from a Chinese-made RPG-2 slammed into a wall of the unicameral <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> shortly before the day's session began The impact startled spectators entering the building only a few yards from where the grenade struck. `` This audacious guerrilla action demonstrates the inability of the puppet armed forces, a useless army that is not even capable of guarding utility poles, nor highways, nor its own barracks, nor the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the Radio Venceremos broadcast. The broadcast characterized the Assembly as `` the lair of the corrupt and death-squad members.'' A congressional commission and several judges are investigating cases of alleged misuse of public funds by government officials. There have also been allegations right-wing death squads operated out of the Assembly building during the early 1980s, when thousands of suspected leftists were abducted and murdered. A 9-year-old civil war pits the rebels against forces of the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> administration. In 1982, the Assembly was the target of a similar rocket-propelled grenade attack, which also caused no injuries. About 65,000 people have been killed in the war, the majority of them civilians.

 <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, the Orthodox Jewish businessman who wants to purchase the assets of the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday he is keeping all options open about their future use. He said he is willing to talk to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> about their possible activities at <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, a Christian retreat and theme park in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and the other assets to be purchased for $ 115 million. `` I have made no decision whatsoever as to the utilization of the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> assets,'' <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, 34, said at a news conference at his lawyer's office in the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Over the next several weeks I will be engaged in an intensive analysis of the property in order to determine their best possible use from a business and financial standpoint,'' he said. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> said he was interested primarily in the assets for their real estate potential _ especially the 1,700 undeveloped acres adjacent to the 500-acre Heritage park. He did not rule out negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> about their lease of any of the properties or the satellite television facilities. `` I'm a very open-minded person. I'm prepared to speak to them and anyone,'' <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> stepped down as leader of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> after admitting to a sexual encounter in March 1987 but has since been trying to regain control of the ministry. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> clarified in an opening statement that he was purchasing only the fixed assets from the trustee in bankruptcy and not the Heritage church itself. `` It is my understanding that the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has been set up as a separate and distinct organization which leases certain of the facilities at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> on a month-to-month basis,'' he said. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> said he believed the 1,700 undeveloped acres have excellent potential for condominiums, retail and office development. He also said a motion was filed Friday morning with the bankruptcy court seeking approval of the purchase contract and all deposits have been paid to the escrow agent as outlined. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s family has roots in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> real estate that go back 40 years, but he was little known outside the area's Orthodox Jewish community until March when he purchased the old <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> tire plant in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, Ont. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> released a summary saying that in addition to the Firestone property he owns 270 acres for mixed use development in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and about 900 acres in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. Among his other interests are a landfill site in the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> area, a 50 percent interest in a local waste disposal and recycling company and wholesale and retail travel agencies. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> stands for `` Praise The Lord,'' or `` People That Love.''

 An experimental <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> jet crashed in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> while serving as a chase plane for a research flight Friday, but the pilot ejected safely, a spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishmael </PERSON>, 39, `` was out waving before the helicopter picked him up'' from the crash site near here, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's been checked by a flight surgeon and he's fine.'' <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, a dispatcher for <ORGANIZATION> Kern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said her agency provided some type of medical aid and extinguished a grass fire caused by the crash. <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ishmael </PERSON> was piloting a modified F-A-18 chase plane as a safety measure.

 Israeli troops killed four Palestinians and wounded 21 Friday during street battles in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> sparked by the mysterious death of a man reportedly found manacled with army rope, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The violence also was fed by rumors, denied by the army, that soldiers fired into a mosque. It was the highest one-day death toll in six months. Sixteen Palestinians were reported wounded elsewhere in the occupied territories. An army official confirmed one death in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, largest city in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, but said soldiers were not involved. He said the army was checking the other fatalities. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaar </PERSON>, a 32-year-old Palestinian suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was found stabbed to death in a cave near <LOCATION> Burka </LOCATION> village in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army said it was checking. At least 289 Palestinians have been killed since the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began Dec. 8 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Six Israelis also have died. Military authorities put a curfew on <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and adjoining refugee camps, confining more than 120,000 Palestinians to their homes. The violence was fed by rumors that soldiers chasing stone-throwers fired into the <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Edin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosque </PERSON> during evening prayers Thursday. The army said the rumors were untrue. Tension grew in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> after the death of <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanfa </PERSON>, 31, whose body was found near the mosque Thursday night, his hands bound together with army-issue plastic rope. Hospital officials said he had been shot several times. Army officials said soldiers killed a Palestinian in clashes near the mosque Thursday night, but it was not clear whether they meant <PERSON> Hanfa </PERSON>. `` As a result of the death and the rumors about entering the mosque, tension was created in the city,'' an officer said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. Hundreds of Palestinians chanting pro-PLO slogans carried <PERSON> Hanfa </PERSON>'s coffin through the city Friday morning. After the funeral and Moslem noon prayers, stone-throwing Arab youths and soldiers fought throughout <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and the adjacent <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> and Askar refugee camps. Arab reporters claimed <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahloul </PERSON>, 26, was in the doorway of his house when soldiers breaking up a nearby protest fatally shot him in the head and stomach. The army confirmed the death but said troops were not involved. <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Najar </PERSON>, 20, was fatally shot in the head after dozens of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths gathered outside the central market to throw stones at soldiers to protest <PERSON> Bahloul </PERSON>'s death, hospital officials said. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeh </PERSON>, 20, was dead on arrival at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> after being shot in the chest during a clash in the <LOCATION> Ras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ain </LOCATION> neighborhood, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters and hospital officials said. A fourth Palestinian, 17-year-old <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashtaraweh </PERSON>, was shot in the head during a clash and died en route to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, hospital officials reported. Of the 21 wounded in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, two were in critical condition, including a 9-year-old boy with a bullet in the chest, hospital officials said. Also among the casualties was a 5-year-old boy from the <PERSON> Askar </PERSON> camp who suffered a thigh wound. The army said a soldier was hit in the head by a stone in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and hospitalized. Of the other Palestinians reported wounded, five were in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and 11 in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Soldiers demolished the home of a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> resident who allegedly threw a hand grenade at an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION>'s car last week, the army said.

He said the South African delegation was led by <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>, director-general of political affairs. No announcement was expected at the conclusion of the talks and officials did not say where the negotiations were being held, other than they were in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said the talks dealt with a timetable for the withdrawal of the Cuban military personnel in line with the Nov. 1 deadline <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> accepted for beginning a plan for independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> insists the Cubans should be removed from Marxist-ruled <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in about a year. In earlier rounds of talks, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> first said the withdrawal would take four years, then lowered that to three and last month reportedly accepted a proposal for a two-year phased withdrawal. Officials involved in the talks have expressed confidence a mutually acceptable timetable will be worked out during the next formal meeting of the four parties in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>. No date has been set for those talks, but they presumably would be held before the Nov. 1 date for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to begin implementing U.N. Resolution 435, passed 10 years ago, calling for independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> plans to send a peacekeeping force of 7,500 military personnel and 2,000 members of a civilian support staff to oversee elections for a national assembly in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> advance team is now in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> checking on housing, airports and other facilities the peacekeepers will need. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have estimated the peacekeeping force, to be called the U.N. Transition Assistance Group, will cost $ 600 million to $ 700 million. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has administered <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> under a mandate from the defunct League of Nations since the end of World War I. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> have revoked the mandate and declared <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s administration illegal. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is located between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, which received independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975.

But rebels of the Union for Total Independence for <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, supported by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have waged guerrilla warfare against the government and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to help battle the rebels.

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> moved Friday to develop programs that maintain `` the highest ethical standards'' in a department previously run by <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> who was for 14 months under criminal investigation. `` Subordinates can not be left to speculate as to the values of the organization,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in his first major speech to <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees as attorney general. `` Top leadership must give forth clear and explicit signals, lest any confusion or uncertainty exist over what is and is not permissible conduct,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> added. He said that `` to do otherwise allows informal and potentially subversive ` codes of conduct' to be transmitted with a wink and a nod, and encourages an inferior ethical system based on ` going along to get along' or on the notion that ` everybody's doing it.''' The attorney general in his remarks made no reference to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who left the department in August. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> introduced the subject of ethics by quoting the results of a newly released <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press-Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> poll showing that seven out of 10 Americans think illegal payoffs are common in the federal government. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also raised the issue of how close the relationship should be between an attorney general and the president, saying that how their relationship `` can be both as close as it should be and as correct as it ought to be is a difficult question'' and one that is worthy of study. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said there is a `` need to look analytically'' at the relationship. A Thornburgh assistant, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, later said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was n't referring to any specific relationship, such as the particularly close one between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was expressing a general feeling that the matter should be examined, as a subject of scholarly study outside the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and that the comment was n't meant as `` a criticism of anyone.'' The criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> stemmed from his ties to longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and culminated in July with no indictment but a finding by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had probably twice broken conflict-of-interest laws and tax laws. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he has requested Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> `` to gather the views of all senior management to help in developing proposals that will aid our employees in maintaining the highest ethical standards.'' He said the questions that should be addressed include how to avoid any appearance of personal and financial conflict of interest, how to deal with lapses in behavior, how to properly regulate interaction between employees and outside groups and what ` perks' are proper and which are out of bounds. `` The overall goal is not to put shackles on a department whose honesty and integrity are beyond any serious dispute,'' said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. `` The goal.. is to put our ideals and our principles on the record, and to say to the public, ` These are our standards and we mean to live up to them Watch us do it.''' A section of the code of federal regulations sets out standards of conduct for <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees, dealing with such questions as potential conflicts of interest. But `` what the attorney general asked <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> to do is to review that code in light of current concerns and current issues,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said after the speech. He said ethics are a subject of increasing concern in business, politics and the religious community as well. `` Because something was written 10 years ago does n't mean it applies to all situatons today,'' said <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, who said the result of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> effort may mean `` some clarifications, not a massive re-write'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> portion of the code of federal regulations pertaining to ethics. The new attorney general also said that department employees should `` close ranks'' following internal debate so that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> speaks `` with one voice.'' To do otherwise, he said, would only give `` aid and comfort to our adversaries.'' In addition, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said that his management style is `` no surprises,'' that he wants to hear bad news directly from employees and that `` I do n't want to find out about it first by the backdoor or from our friends in the news media.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> telephoned syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> on Friday to offer congratulations on the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to drop its weapons-possession case against him, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said. `` The president said it was an outrage that they prosecuted me,'' said <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who had lashed out on Thursday at city officials, calling their case against him a `` malicious, political prosecution.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made the call because he considers <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> a friend and was concerned about him, according to a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The 63-year-old columnist had been charged with using an unregistered weapon and ammunition to wound a teen-ager who intruded in his back yard in June. If he had been convicted on the misdemeanor charges, he would have faced a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a $ 2,000 fine. When a jury hearing the case remained deadlocked after more than eight hours, <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sr. </ORGANIZATION> declared a mistrial. The city decided Wednesday not to retry the case. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who has advocated strict handgun control in columns and speeches, has stressed that he also had the right to take whatever means necessary to protect himself and his family. The columnist said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- reiterated his stance that he's in favor of a waiting period so that criminals and nuts can not buy guns,'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said. `` But he does not favor a situation where robbers and rapists can sit assured that they can have a gun.'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who has dined privately with the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, said he and the president talked about his legal ordeal and other matters for four or five minutes. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were guests of <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> for last Sunday's contest against the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>, where Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> delivered an anti-drug message. When <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> mentioned that he had seen Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the football contest, the president responded, `` You know, that lady had a lot to do with my calling,'' according to <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>. More than 200 other well-wishers have telephoned him in the last two days, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it will quiet down for another 200 calls,'' he said.

 The Atomic Safety and <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> vacated on Friday another <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> panel's decision to go forward with a full-power license for the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, N.Y The appeal board found that the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> did not have the authority to remove state and local governments as intevenors in a case before a different panel, said <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopeck </PERSON>. Friday's ruling `` reverses that and at the same time, says all outstanding emergency planning issues have not been resolved,'' <PERSON> Kopeck </PERSON> said. `` Thus, the full-power license authorization does not exist and that authorization must be vacated,'' he said. In a 20-page decision, the three-judge appeals panel agreed with <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON>'s owners that the state and local governments had `` obstructed the discovery process and failed to obey certain -LRB- licensing -RRB- board orders ... and that the only appropriate sanction is dismissal ...'' However, the licensing board only had authority to dismiss the governments in the case it was hearing, according to the appeals board. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the embattled $ 5.3 billion plant, said the company will fight Friday's ruling. `` Today's decision by the appeals board did not overrule the ... licensing board decision on the merits of emergency planning, nor did the appeals court overrule the findings that the intervening <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governments had indeed acted willfully and in bad faith by obstructing the judicial process,'' <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> said. `` We will appeal today's decision directly to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, said the governor was studying the decision and would have no immediate comment. The Atomic Safety and <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, in a ruling Sept. 23, elimiminated <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and the Town of <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> as intervenors in a case involving an emergency evacuation drill conducted earlier this year. The panel also found that there was reasonable assurance that the public's safety could be protected in the event of an accident at the reactor. By a 2-1 decision, the panel agreed with <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION>'s argument that `` realism'' dictated that in case of an actual accident, state and local authorities would, in fact, cooperate with emergency measures planned by the company even if they did n't have their own Current federal regulation prevents the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> from issuing a full-power license to a nuclear plant unless there is an emergency plan that gives reasonable assurance the public will be safe if an accident occurs.

The commission, which sponsored the first debate, took over sponsorship, but could not reach agreement with the League to obtain use of Shrine Auditorium which was to have been the site. <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said final arrangements still were being made between the commission, the university and the city. The debate will be Thursday or Friday, depending on whether the American League baseball play-offs go to a seventh game. <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said the debate would begin at 9 p.m. EDT and would follow the format of the first debate in which the candidates responded to questions from a panel of four reporters. The first debate was Sept. 25, in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, on the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attacked the Republicans Friday for standing by while foreigners are `` buying up <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' but he mistakenly told workers at a plant owned by Italians that they were `` survivors'' in the international trade battles. The Democratic presidential nominee used the <ORGANIZATION> Moog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant as the backdrop for a speech blasting <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s statement Wednesday that he welcomed foreign investment in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, business and real estate. `` If anyone asks you what's at stake in this election, just remind them of that moment in the debate Wednesday night when Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he's happy that foreign owners are buying up <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Maybe the Republican ticket wants our children to work for foreign owners, pay rent to foreign owners, and owe their future to foreign owners _ but that's not the kind of future <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I and -LRB- Missouri Rep. -RRB- <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> want for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he continued. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' comments caused one executive at the plant to ask another whether the Democratic presidential candidate realized who the plant's owners were. The <PERSON> Moog </PERSON> family sold the company more than 10 years ago to <ORGANIZATION> IFINT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the American subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> IFI </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IFI </ORGANIZATION> is owned by the <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON> family, which also owns the automaker <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said that officials at the campaign headquarters were aware of the ownership prior to the event. Another adviser, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself was not aware of the company's Italian owners. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign took delight in what spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' gaffe. `` It occurs to me that that tank ride he took a few weeks ago may have done more damage than I first suspected, even with his protective head gear,'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' ride in an army tank during a campaign visit to a defense plant. `` The bottom line is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is competing better overseas, we are opening access to foreign markets, we are better controlling the foreign trade deficit while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy continues to expand. As usual, the governor is out in left field somewhere,'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> and other <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides moved quickly in an effort to convince reporters that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not criticizing <PERSON> Moog </PERSON> or its owners but was opposed to the growing `` trend'' of foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` If you're going to talk about foreign invesment, that's the kind of place to do it,'' <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. But in his speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> referred to the company as one of the `` few survivors'' of the auto parts industry's battle with foreign competitors. `` Here at <ORGANIZATION> Moog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION>, you know as well as anyone that American businesses and American products and American jobs are fighting for survival in the world marketplace,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in the speech. `` Whether or not we win that battle will determine whether our children and grandchildren and generations to come continue to enjoy an American standard of living.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> then departed from the text of his speech to tell the workers he realized that they understood that message, telling the workers, `` You are one of the few survivors.'' <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not outrightly opposed to foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and noted that the company had American management and was an exporter. In the speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the union workers that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is `` happy to hand a ` For Sale' sign on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has spent the last eight years with a ` Do Not Disturb' sign on his office door.'' In constrast, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he and running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> work aggressively to win access for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products to foreign markets and would offer protection to certain American industries provided those companies agreed to modernize their plants and retrain their workers to become more competitive. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials he said had sought foreign help in fighting the recently passed trade bill and also chided a former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official who was seeking a loobying job with Japanese auto parts manufactuers at the same time he was representing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in trade negotiations with Japanese auto parts makers. `` While -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has -RRB- been a summer soldier in the battle for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic future, some of his colleagues in this adminstration have been trying to enlist on the other side,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` In a <ORGANIZATION> Dukakis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, my friends, we're going to fight for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic future. And we'll pledge allegiance to only one flag _ Old Glory.'' From <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was headed to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, another key swing state where the Democratic ticket believes it has a good chance to defeat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. On Saturday the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was campaigning in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A felony court acquitted a Greek businessman of espionage Friday, although he admitted giving details of the U.S.-built Stinger anti-aircraft missile to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The three-member court said <PERSON> Michalis </PERSON> <PERSON> Megaloconomou </PERSON> was innocent on the ground the material handed over was not secret. `` Megaloconomou took unclassified materials for a well-known weapons system. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was n't going to build anything from material it already had obtained from other people,'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Constantinos </PERSON> <PERSON> Androulikakis </PERSON> said in his summing up. The 40-year-old businessman told the court he gave 400 microfiche cards to a Soviet intelligence agent in April 1984 but did n't know they contained information on the shoulder-fired Stinger's trigger system. `` I thought they contained information on a telephone system,'' he said. <PERSON> Megaloconomou </PERSON> also told the court he traveled to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1984 on a false passport and was given a miniature camera, decoding pads and a radio receiver by a Soviet agent. The case was linked with the May 1985 defection in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> of Soviet agent <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Bokhane </PERSON>, whose revelations cast doubts on <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s capacity to safeguard <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secrets and delayed the sale of 40 U.S.-made jet fighters to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Brig. <PERSON> Ioannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexakis </PERSON>, a former head of counter-intelligence for the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, told the court Wednesday <PERSON> Megaloconomou </PERSON> had been a Soviet spy for 10 years when he was arrested in September 1985. But the prosecutor, addressing only the Stinger case, said, `` We ca n't say he gave secrets to a foreign power and endangered the security of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> or its allies. Espionage is taking state secrets with the intent of harming the nation.'' <PERSON> Megaloconomou </PERSON> is a former deputy director at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hellas </ORGANIZATION>, or SEH, a Greek company affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION>. Also acquitted were two SEH employees, commercial director <PERSON> Constantinos </PERSON> <PERSON> Libousakis </PERSON> and secretary <PERSON> Artmenis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzirozidou </PERSON>, who were tried on misdemeanor charges in the same court for violating state secrets through negligence. SEH was among firms in six Western European countries that manufactured Stinger components under license. <PERSON> Megaloconomou </PERSON> was arrested on the basis of information given to the American <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Bokhane </PERSON>, who served as deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GRU </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bokhane </PERSON> said <PERSON> Megaloconomou </PERSON> was recruited by the <ORGANIZATION> GRU </ORGANIZATION> in 1975 and began selling them information in 1977, according to <PERSON> Alexakis </PERSON>. In a 1986 trial, a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> navy officer and a Greek businessman accused of selling information and telecommunications equipment to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> were acquitted on the ground that <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> intelligence services could n't confirm <PERSON> Bokhane </PERSON>'s allegations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> delayed approving the sale of the F-16 jetfighters to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> until Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s socialist government signed an agreement in 1986 pledging to prevent advanced Western technology from reaching the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Friday urged <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to begin trade and said it would drop trade barriers to promote ties with its communist rival. If <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> agrees, the trade will be treated as domestic commerce with no tariffs, <PERSON> Rha </PERSON> <PERSON> Woong-bae </PERSON>, the deputy prime minister and economic planning minister, told a news conference. He said the trade will not include military products. <PERSON> Rha </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s top economic official, called for a quick start to trade both directly and through third nations. He also called for talks on working out details of the commerce, which he said would benefit both sides. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, has improved its trade and other relations with other communist nations, such as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rha </PERSON> listed coal, iron ore and corn as probable import items from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and steel and textiles as likely South Korean exports to the North. Any trade, either direct or through third nations, would depend on North Korean consent. There are no indications the North would accept trade with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, and past efforts at improving relations have had little success. The countries do not have any contacts or ties beyond a single hotline. The border is sealed and both nations have been locked in a bitter confrontation for 40 years. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo this week called for a major effort to end the confrontation and work toward reunifying the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. Radical students have held violent demonstrations to press demands for reunification. The countries were split at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean War, which ended with an armistice in 1953. Talks on improving relations are to resume Oct. 13 after deadlocking in August. The sides held five rounds of talks on economic cooperation in 1985, but the North stopped contacts in January 1986 to protest U.S.-South Korean military training exercises.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> magazine said Friday the captors of Anglican church envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> will free him `` very soon'' and American hostages will be released before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election Nov. 8. <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said two other British hostages will be freed with <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, who has been missing since January 1987. Al-Anwar, a conservative daily newspaper based in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> would be freed within 72 hours. An Israeli newpaper said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> made a deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to free American hostages in exchange for delivery of arms and spare parts through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials denied the report. Lebanese police said two unidentified foreigners kidnapped in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> 21 months ago were Czechoslovak businessmen held only a few days. That leaves 14 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans. The Anglican church and British government said they had no information about <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. Both <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> publications have been inaccurate in recent reports about hostages. But Ash-Shiraa, based in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, correctly revealed in November 1986 that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had secretly delivered arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The report about arms in The Nation, a new English-language Israeli weekly, was not attributed. It said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government also agreed to pay $ 7 million ransom to Shiite Moslem extremists holding the hostages but refused their demand for immunity from prosecution. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> denied the report but said there were `` a lot of free-lancers, independent operators in the region.'' On Thursday, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was not dealing with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and that `` Anyone who tries to cut across our policies should butt out.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> refused questions about the reports as he left for a speaking engagement in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, traveling with him, said there was `` nothing new'' on any hostages. The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said of the <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> story: `` We have nothing that would indicate this is anything different from all the hundreds of previous reports.'' Lambeth Palace, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> headquarters of the archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We have not heard anything here and in view of the sort of relationships we have established, we would be likely to hear something.'' <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, personal emissary of Archbishop <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, disappeared after leaving his west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> hotel to meet with a group holding hostages, including American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and is the foreigner held longest. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s recent decision to restore full diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` provided efforts currently under way to release <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and his countrymen with a strong impetus,'' Ash-Shiraa reported. The other British hostages are journalist <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>, kidnapped March 25, 1985, and television news producer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, seized April 17, 1986. Hostage <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, held since April 11, 1986, is <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> but also holds a British passport. On April 23, 1986, a group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslems </ORGANIZATION> said it had killed <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>. A videotape purporting to show him hanged was made public, but no body was found. <ORGANIZATION> Ash-Shiraa </ORGANIZATION> quoted a security source it did not name as saying the release Monday of <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, an Indian who is a resident <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> alien, marked `` the beginning of the release of more American hostages.'' `` The source said American hostages would be released before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential elections,'' it said without further elaboration. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was involved in negotiations or deals for <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s release, replied: `` That's not true.'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, by a pro-Iranian group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. Taken with him from the campus of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-affiliated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> were American teachers <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. The Nation report said that two weeks before <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s release, South Korean Oil Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bong </PERSON> signed an agreement in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to sell to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> millions of dollars in spare parts for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s U.S.-made armaments It also said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to provide the $ 7 million ransom demanded by the kidnappers because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not want to appear to be purchasing their freedom. The money would be paid indirectly to the kidnappers by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the form of commissions for Iranian purchases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to The Nation. It said the deal was struck after a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who hold Iranian and Lebanese passports were permitted to visit <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and one other American hostage in January. <PERSON> Giora </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamis </PERSON>, owner of the news service that sold the story to The Nation, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the report was based on interviews with three of about 15 dual-passport holders involved in the contacts as well as South Korean sources. <PERSON> Shamis </PERSON>'s news service, Depth, is based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Al-Anwar quoted two sources it did not identify in the report on <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. It said one reported <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> `` has been moved from the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern suburbs and predicted he will be released in 72 hours,'' but the other said he would be freed when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> restores diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> severed relations in November 1986, accusing <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> of involvement in a plot to blow up an Israeli airliner. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is an ally of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and has said it was working for release of all hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Most are in the hands of Shiite Moslems loyal to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist revolution <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has an estimated 40,000 soldiers stationed in Moslem sectors of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and northern and eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley. Police said the freed Czechoslovaks were taken to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> in a convoy of evacuees from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> a week after their abduction Jan. 26, 1987. `` The kidnappers must have mistaken the blond pair for Westerners and released them after discovering the error,'' a spokesman said privately.

<HEAD>Government Denies Amnesty International Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has denied <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s reports of political assassinations and political prisoners in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, saying they `` deform reality.'' The London-based human rights organization said Wednesday in its annual report that it continued to receive complaints from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of arbitrary arrests and assassinations of members of groups frequently related to land disputes. `` Many assassinations were attributed to civilian gunmen linked to landowners but seemed to have the consent of the authorities,'' the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> released a communique Thursday saying the government expressed its `` absolute rejection'' of the allegations. `` Amnesty International's mention of the existence of political prisoners in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is unfounded,'' it said. It also said the government made a detailed check of cases mentioned by Amnesty and found the cases were properly described by Mexican police and judicial authorities as involving common crimes `` without the influence of any kind of political situation.'' The ministry said <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> `` distributes reports without checking the facts and without an opportune presentation to the government of our country.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it was in communication with the government by letter and visits by government representatives to the organization. Its annual report said at least 23 people adopted as `` prisoners of conscience'' by the organization remain in jail. Some of the prisoners have been sentenced for crimes such as robbery, assault and homicide the report said but it added `` it seems these charges were imposed for political motives, for legal, peaceful activities as campesino or community leaders.''

 Four Americans sailed into Laotian waters Friday and floated dollar bills stamped with a $ 2.4 million reward offer for missing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen. <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> navy boats waved the group back to shore and retrieved the money, but the Americans said they threw it back into the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The Americans tossed sealed plastic envelopes containing a total of about $ 1,000 into the river after their two rented fishing boats moved about 220 yards into Laotian waters. The Mekong forms a boundary between <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and flows to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. They also stuffed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet currency into a toy boat guided by remote control toward <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. `` We are really encouraged. We had a great day,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and the other three belong to a private lobbying group called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION>. They believe Americans taken prisoner during the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war are still held in communist <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Those three governments deny holding any Americans. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> is convinced his brother <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> remains captive in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> since he was reported missing 22 years ago. Laotian authorities captured two other members of the group Sunday after they sailed into the same general area, tossed the same reward offers into the river, then apparently landed at a Laotian village. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Vientiene </PERSON> said it has received no response to its inquiry about the Americans _ <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hampstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, D-Ind., was quoted by The <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> -LRB- Ind. <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> newspaper as saying Friday the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told him the two are held in a compound in <LOCATION> Vientiene </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is confident they will be out in a short time,'' <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` I'm very optimistic they will be released in a short time.'' The <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> navy boat asked the Americans to stop tossing the packets, waved them back to <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> shores, then began retrieving the money. `` It wo n't work. It's incredibly stupid,'' one Thai officer told reporters. The navy boat then escorted <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON>, the group leader, to a navy station where he was told the group's actions were not allowed. An officer returned 90 packets of dollar bills to <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON>, and the former <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beret </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said he would have to toss them back into the river. `` So we tossed them into the river from the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> side and all the kids enjoyed plunging into the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> to get them,'' said <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> of Winter Haven, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, handed out balloons and reward stickers to youngsters. Ms. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> was a nurse during the Vietnam War. The other member of the group, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, was in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> during the war. The $ 2.4 million is being offered to any <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> or Vietnamese who brings out an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> war prisoner. The money was pledged by 21 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen and citizens. About 58,000 Americans died before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces withdrew from the Vietnam War in 1973, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government still lists 2,393 Americans as missing in action in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Thai navy officials said the group's entry into Laotian waters could jeopardize Thai-Laotian relations. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government also has criticized the reward offer as an impediment to official contacts with the Indochinese governments to account for the missing servicemen.

 Friday was the last day on the air for radio station <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION>, for 62 years the flagship of the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> radio network that was home to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> conducted by <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Toscanini </PERSON>. Its spot at 660 on the AM dial, a clear-channel signal that could be picked up in as many as 35 states at night, is going to an all-sports station. <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> was descended from the station that was the first to broadcast a World Series, the first to run a commercial, the first with a coast-to-coast hookup and the first to broadcast a national political convention. At the end of the show, everyone in the studio counted down from 10, but the power was turned off before <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s distinctive three-gong chime could sound for the last time. The switch was thrown at 5:30 p.m. The end of an era came as a result of the $ 6 billion deal in 1985 in which <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulation prevents a new owner from keeping both a TV and radio station in the same market, so <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> decided to sell its new radio properties and keep the more profitable <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> radio network went to Westwood One for $ 55 million, and five stations, including <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION>, were sold to <ORGANIZATION> Emmis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 121.5 million. GE has one station left, <ORGANIZATION> KNBR </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which is for sale. <ORGANIZATION> Emmis </ORGANIZATION> decided to ditch <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION>'s call letters and format and move in its <ORGANIZATION> WFAN </ORGANIZATION>, a local all-sports station that held the less desirable frequency of 1050. The new station signed on from its studios in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> at 5:30 p.m., with the words, `` Sports radio 66 W-F-A-N.'' About 50 <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> employees, including its on-air personalities, have known since February they would be out of jobs, but none jumped ship ahead of time, said general manager <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> `` People sort of want to be here for the end,'' she said. `` No one's thrilled about it; no one even likes it. But it's kind of a piece of history, and people want to be here for it.'' <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> said goodbye with a 90-minute retrospective program Friday featuring clips from programs with <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fibber </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Molly </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> also had such classic shows as `` Amos' n' <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>,'' `` Your Hit Parade'' and `` Information, Please.'' There were also the original soap operas, like `` Ma Perkins'' and `` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, Backstage Wife.'' The station, then owned by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, went on the air in April 1922 as W2XY. It became WBAY in July that year and was changed to <ORGANIZATION> WEAF </ORGANIZATION> the next month. RCA bought the station from <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T for $ 1 million in 1926 when it formed <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> to help sell the radios it was making, but it did n't change the call letters to <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> until 1946 The first radio commercial was broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> WEAF </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 28, 1922, when a real estate developer paid $ 100 for a 10-minute announcement to advertise apartments. `` Up to that point radio was for experimenters and people were still thinking of ways to make money with it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> program director <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, one of those losing a job. <ORGANIZATION> WEAF </ORGANIZATION>'s other firsts included the first World Series broadcast, <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> vs. Giants, in 1923; the first coast-to-coast hookup, in 1924, and the first broadcast of the national political conventions, in 1924. In 1925, it broadcast a presidential inaugural address _ <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON>'s _ for the first time.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came to <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s defense on Friday, portraying the embattled vice presidential candidate as a man who shares <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s conservative beliefs and should help carry on his policies. In a series of speeches designed to win support for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate among middle-class and blue-collar voters, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mentioned <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> more than he usually does on campaign trips. He praised <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance in his face-off against the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` One thing's even clearer to me after watching the debate Wednesday night _ the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> ticket will continue the policies of peace and prosperity that have, as <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> said, made this great nation ` the envy of the world,''' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a cheering group of several hundred business leaders. To a screaming, flag-waving crowd of 10,000 students and residents in nearby <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> earlier in the day, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said with a grin, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economy is a Grand Prix racer, and the way to keep it on track is to give <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a checkered flag in their race in November.'' Late Friday, the president spoke at a $ 1,000-per-plate <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser and attempted to counter the idea that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance had cost votes `` The other night ... the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> establishment was betting against him,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` But I tell you, the smart money was riding on a great senator, by the name of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. He got my vote. How about yours?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> then predicted that in November, `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will be investing in a new option for the American engine _ I call it the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turbocharger. And when that happens, all I can say is, Put the pedal to the metal and watch <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> go.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s references to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> came amid an apparent Republican damage-control effort to blunt criticism of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance in the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, debate. Instant polls conducted after the event showed the public, by a wide margin, believed <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had handily beaten <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in the debate. The president said, `` The liberals are saying they want to help the American middle class. And what they're planning to do ... is to tax them and tax them and tax them some more. If you ask me, the liberals are selling the middle class short.'' He said the nation had enjoyed economic good times during his eight years in office and suggested that the economic hardship the state endured as the auto industry suffered might return under a Democratic administration. `` And you may have heard that I kind of like what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said about this election _ ` when you have to change horses in <LOCATION> midstream </LOCATION>, does n't it make sense to switch to one who's going the same way,''' he said. After <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ended his speech, a man claiming he had been the subject of government mind control experiments disrupted the event, making a long and rambling argument that he had been mistreated. <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents, apparently determining that he was not a physical threat to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, made no attempt to approach the man, who identified himself as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, 58. He gave no address or hometown. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, angered by what he called an `` unfair'' disruption of the dinner guests, finally shouted into the microphone that if the man had a complaint, he should `` put it in a letter and send it to me.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit was a homecoming of sorts, since it was in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> in July 1980 that the former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> governor accepted his party's nomination for the first time _ and chose <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be his running mate. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recalled the time as `` a magical moment'' and `` one of the proudest moments of my life.'' Most experts rate <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> a tossup, though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign adviser <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said earlier this week that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign figures showed the vice president ahead in the state by seven to eight points. The state went to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 59 percent to 40 percent, in 1984.

 An outboard-motor manufacturer has agreed to pay for a $ 20 million cleanup of toxic PCBs in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, ending years of bitter haggling over the Superfund site, officials announced Friday. Under a consent decree signed by <ORGANIZATION> Outboard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and federal and state officials, thousands of pounds of toxic polychlorinated biphenyls will be removed, treated and safely stored, state Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said. `` This is a major environmental victory,'' <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said, noting that no taxpayer dollars will be used in the cleanup. <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, an important <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> port at <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION>, 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, has been listed on the federal Superfund list of environmental hazards and at one time was considered Illinois' worst pollution problem. Contamination of the harbor began in 1961, when hydraulic fluid containing PCBs leaked from the hydraulic systems at the company's <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION> plant into waste waters, which were dumped into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and onto plant property Public health officials have advised against eating fish from the harbor. PCBs have been shown to cause tumors in laboratory animals and are suspected to cause cancer in humans. `` We obviously believe that it's time to get this matter resolved,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Laurin </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in a telephone interview from <ORGANIZATION> Outboard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION> headquarters. While saying it is `` hard to be happy over spending $ 20 million in company assets,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called the decree `` the best settlement possible.'' The case became entangled in the legal system as company officials first argued PCBs posed no threat to humans, then barred from their facilities federal environmental officials seeking to determine the extent of the pollution, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrecone </PERSON>. After changes in the federal Superfund law in 1986 allowed the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> such access, the company agreed to negotiate with state and federal authorities, <PERSON> Perrecone </PERSON> said. Under terms of Friday's consent decree, <ORGANIZATION> Outboard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> will begin cleaning up the PCBs next spring and should complete the task by 1992. The company will remove and treat contaminated material from both the harbor and its property. `` The agreement called for us to remove and treat sediments and soils that have the highest levels of contamination and encapsulate the remaining low-level soils and sediments in three areas,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Outboard Marine is a $ 1.3 billion manufacturer of recreational marine products and other recreational materials.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Friday of being soft on criminals while displaying `` an astounding lack of insensitivity, a lack of human compassion'' for the victims of crime. He assailed the prisoner-furlough program in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> as a `` stupid law'' and charged that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as governor, had presided over a criminal-justice system `` completely out of whack and certainly out of touch with, I'd say, what are the grass-roots values of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, a ` Twilight Zone' world where prisoners' right of privacy has more weight than citizens' right to safety.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in his first year as governor, vetoed a bill to repeal furloughs for first-degree murderers. Moreover, he said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` has never apologized'' to a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple that was terrorized in 1987 by a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prisoner, a convicted murderer, who was released on a weekend leave. Lending weight to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attack, the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> man who was assaulted, <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Friday taping radio ads for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign. With three dozen uniformed police officers on stage with him, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his charge in a speech before a supportive audience of nearly 1,000 people. A large spillover crowd waited outside and cheered <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he departed. The attack was part of a determined strategy to win the support of undecided, swing voters _ mostly blue-collar, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, Democrats _ by accentuating issues such as crime, the death penalty, abortion and taxes, while portraying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal who is out of step with mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advisers believe the swing voters could tilt the balance in a close election. Campaigning in a key battleground state where 23 electoral votes are at stake, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke first in <LOCATION> Xenia </LOCATION> and then flew to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> for a courthouse rally in nearby <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, where he got a tumultuous welcome from a crowd of thousands. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't mention his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in any of his three speeches, but in answer to a question from a reporter expressed renewed confidence in <LOCATION> Quayle </LOCATION>. Closing out a week of appearances, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke at a rally in <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s Summit, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and then went to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, where he received the endorsement of former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, a fellow Republican. While saying he did not know <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> told reporters `` I'm tired of reading accounts of the inadequacies or derogatory statements made about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had served as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> while he was head of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and that `` on many occasions he took a very firm stand, regardless of what the consequences might be to him personally.'' While sharpening his assault on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended himself against charges he is waging a negative campaign. `` I do n't believe it is negative to try to clarify honestly and hopefully fairly the distinctions with one's opponents. That is the business of political campaigns.'' In great detail, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recounted the story of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, a convicted murderer who went on a crime spree in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> after he escaped during a weekend prison furlough from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has talked about <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> before, but never before in as much depth. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, `` a cold-blooded killer, broke into the home of a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple, <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Angi </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, sadistically torturing the man, raping and torturing his fiancee and repeatedly threatening to kill them both. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> responded to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He said, `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not going to play politics with the victims of crime. He said it was a tragedy and the law has been changed.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that when people tried to look into the furlough program `` the governor's administration stonewalled, citing _ and this is no joke _ the prisoner's right to privacy.'' Moreover, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` though he had met with the families of prisoners, he now refused to meet the victims and their families.'' Families of crime victims collected more than 52,000 signatures in a petition drive to put a repeal referendum on the ballot. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` under the bright spotlight of the presidential campaign, the governor finally relented'' and signed the repeal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` in all this time, as far as I know, the governor has never acknowledged that his furlough program was a tragic mistake.'' He said, `` while the governor has shown great compassion for the difficulties of prisoners and their families _ and no doubt their hardships are severe _ when it comes to the plights of the victims and their families, there is what one can only describe as an astounding lack of sensitivity, a lack of human compassion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I hope I'm wrong about this but I do n't think so, in the year since it happened, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has never aplogized to the Barnes for their ordeal In <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the federal government does not furlough murderers who have not served enough time to be eligible for a parole. Even so, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said the vice president feels the federal furlough program `` should be reviewed'' for possible changes. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was satisfied it was `` fundamentally different'' than the former Massachussetts program.

<HEAD>Oliver North Lecture Draws Criticism at Boston College</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students say <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is n't worth the $ 25,000 the student government is paying him to speak at the school and stepped up a petition drive Friday to get the invitation withdrawn. The disgruntled students, who gathered 550 signatures by Friday afternoon, say <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s fee for the Nov. 2 appearance is too steep and the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel wo n't inspire discussion worth the price. `` It's a mistake that brings profound embarrassment to the entire <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> community,'' said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkie </PERSON>, 22, a senior English major from <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, who helped organize the petition drive. `` This whole episode shows that crime kind of does pay.'' But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuley </PERSON>, executive vice president of the student government board, called North one of the most popular figures of the decade and said the 90-minute lecture will attract a broad range of students. `` Overall, this is a great opportunity to listen to a man responsible for one of the great shake-ups in our government's history,'' <PERSON> McAuley </PERSON> said North faces trial on 16 charges of conspiracy to defraud the government in the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scheme. He has given more than 25 speeches in the last year to raise money for his defense. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION>, an independent student weekly newspaper at the school, said many students were dissatified about not being included in the decision. The decision `` without the approval of anyone else other than the cabinet members is unfair,'' she said. She wrote an editorial against the choice of North. The money for the lecture would come from a student activities fund for the school's 8,500 undergraduates through a mandatory $ 41 student assessment, said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON>, the college's director of communications. The money can be spent at the discretion of the student government board. <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> said that in the past, the fund had been used for several lectures, but this year, the board voted to spend most of it for North's appearance. Last year, former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> lectured at at the school for a combined charge of less than $ 30,000, <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Underground Coal Fire Is Extinguished</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NELSONVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An underground coal fire discovered by children when sticks they poked into the ground caught fire has been extinguished by firefighters with water and synthetic foam into holes bored into the earth. No houses in the southeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city of 5,000 people were damaged by the fire, which had covered a 40-by-40-foot area, but it had threatened as many as 30 homes. `` We were lucky to get to it in its infancy,'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> said Friday. The burning material, waste coal believed to have come from an unmapped mine abandoned in the 1920s, was 4 feet deep. It was discovered Sept. 30. On Wednesday and Thursday, firefighters drilled holes about the size of fire extinguishers into the ground to determine the area of the fire, <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> said. Once isolated, additional holes were dug throughout the area and water was poured into them. `` That is a quenching effect. The quenching essentially would take away the heat,'' the chief said. After another dousing of water, firefighters capped the holes with a synthetic material, which <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> described as a type of firefighting foam used to fight oil fires by smothering them. `` What that essentially does is knock out the oxygen. That way we keep all the oxygen out of it,'' <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> said. Officials determined after additional core samples taken Friday that the fire died out. <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> said the fire entered a coal seam and could have burned indefinitely had it not been extinguished immediately.

<HEAD>City's West Side Takes Off The Wraps After Aerial Pesticide
Spraying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Residents removed wraps of plastic Friday from their cars but found little goo from an overnight aerial spraying of pesticide, the first step in an attack against the crop-threatening Mediterranean fruit fly. Three helicopters dropped 1,400 gallons of the pesticide Malathion over a 35-square-mile area where about 100,000 people live, brightening the night sky with floodlights and causing commotion as they buzzed over houses. `` It was like Rambo,'' said resident <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerwin </PERSON>. `` It was fun. I took pictures.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, chief deputy to the county agriculture commissioner, said the spraying was critical in eradicting the destructive Medfly. Officials also plan a quarantine of fruits and vegetables from leaving the area and the release of 40 million sterile Medflies to mate with the surviving Medflies to forestall breeding. The fly threatens 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables and is considered a serious threat to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s $ 15.5 billion farm economy. Residents worried about the effect of the gooey spray on their health and cars had jammed a county spraying hot line with hundreds of calls, but police and county health officials reported no complaints Friday. Citizens kept pets inside and covered cars or parked them inside garages and shopping malls to prepare for the five-hour attack, which ended 1:30 a.m. Friday. The area sprayed included the cities of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and two of the area's most popular shopping districts, posh <LOCATION> Rodeo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION> and trendy Melrose Avenue. `` There's no smell. The bags looked clean,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Paulee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION>, which spent $ 500 on plastic bags to cover up its fleet of 180 high-priced autos. Business tripled at the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Car </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> on </LOCATION> <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cienega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION> `` Car Wash of the Stars'' on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>. County and state agricultural officials ordered the spraying after 48 Medflies were found in traps in the Palms area since Sept. 26. But the plan to spray the pesticide and corn syrup mixture worried residents. Agriculture officials insisted the pesticide is harmless to humans, and said it should immediately begin killing Medflies who will feed on the sweetened potion that clings to produce, trees and bushes.

<TEXT>
 The curtain has come down on <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>'s fashion runways with audiences confident that spring-summer 1989 will be a good year for <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s designers. After the shock treatment of last year's miniskirts, intended to revive exports that slipped about 2 percent from 1986 to 1987, it appeared time to relax. For the moment, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> fashion seems to have the lead on creativity, riding in the wake of <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCroix </PERSON>'s vivid imagination, but buyers still look to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for well-tailored clothes. `` These collections are very saleable,'' said <PERSON> Elin </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltzman </PERSON>, fashion director at <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION>, of the five-day Italian ready-to-wear showings that ended Thursday. The look for next summer is soft and serene. Gone is the aggressiveness of a bold hemline, a hugged hip or a bulky padded shoulder. Instead the accent is on a rounded silhouette with small shoulders, tapered waistline and long loose hemlines. There is frequent use of rose and cream-colored shades. Pants, out during the miniskirt craze but reinstated in March as the dominant winter look, continued their popularity. Mainly they are ample and often cropped at the calf. Another favorite is the high-waisted sailor pant. Nautical themes pop up throughout the collections from the profuse use of navy blue and blue and white striping to sailor-suit collars on white blouses and jackets. The lore of the exotic influenced the collections with low-waisted sarong skirts and pants, bolero jackets, Chinese prints and Indian embroidery. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Biagiotti </PERSON> brought 20 Chinese models to <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for her collection. Following in alphabetical order are glimpses of who offers what for spring and summer: <ORGANIZATION> Armani </ORGANIZATION> _ Soft daytime suits in silk tweeds and evening wear in diaphanous chiffon and embroidered silk. <PERSON> Basile </PERSON> _ Feminine blazers and long pants or skirts by day, strapless chiffon gowns by night. Byblos _ <LOCATION> Carioca </LOCATION> skirts, calypso pants and tropical wrap around skirts. Fendi _ A schoolgirl look in pleated linen carried into the night by demure touches such as lace collars and floral embroidery. <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> _ Nautical in an almost exclusive preference for navy blue or blue and white stripes. <PERSON> Genny </PERSON> _ Tightest and shortest look on the runway with toreador pants and short-skirted black suits. <PERSON> Gigli </PERSON> _ Waif-like with knotted hemlines and long sleeves. <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> _ Sporty jackets and jumpers for daytime and <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s prettiest evening gown in tea rose silk organza <LOCATION> Missoni </LOCATION> _ Back to his artistry in Murano glass and <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Klimt </PERSON> designs for sumptuous knitwear. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> _ Leather patchworked or embroidered to look like fabric in bright citrus shades or muted tones. Versace _ High waists on pants and skirts with a preference for black and white, a night-look in transparent chiffon tops.

<HEAD>Parliament Adopts Report To Continue Controversial Dam Project</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> adopted a government report Friday recommending continuation of a controversial dam project on the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, following a heated eight-hour debate broadcast live on Hungarian television. The vote to adopt was 317 for, 19 against, with 31 abstaining. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is building the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric power plant and dam jointly with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> financing part of the Hungarian side of the project in return for electric power. The project has run into heavy opposition in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Dozens of independent environmental interest groups and others are demanding construction be halted, claiming it will cause irreparable ecological damage to wetland and wildlife along the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> and pollute large drinking water reserves. Environment Minister <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marothy </PERSON> argued Thursday that halting the project would put a burden of $ 140 million to $ 200 milliion a year on the economy until the mid-1990s. He said that would include investing in substitute energy sources, restoring the landscape, and compensation payments to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Officials estimated this year that the cost of completing the dam would be about $ 1.08 billion while stopping construction would cost about $ 1.1 billion. Environmentalists contend inflation will push costs to $ 2.6 billion. <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Szentagothai </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, on Friday told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> the academy adopted a unanimous decision in 1983 proposing the government halt work on the project but this was never made public. The deputies argued at length over conflicting motions _ one for a roll-call vote and the other for a vote behind closed doors. <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Avar </PERSON>, a prominent actor and member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, broke the deadlock finally by proposing that both groups withdraw their motions and that the vote be taken by standing up. A roll-call vote is rare in Communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s legislature, traditionally accustomed to giving rubber-stamp approval to government decisions by a show of hands. The public wrangle was another indication of the increasing openness in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.

Completed in 1955, it is officially named the <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> Palace of Culture and Science. <PERSON> Konwicki </PERSON> said a neon sign that partially obstructs the name of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> etched into the facade of the 772-foot-tall building should be taken down so <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s name can be seen clearly. `` That would be a symbol of the whole matter,'' <PERSON> Konwicki </PERSON> said. A Konwicki novel, `` A Minor Apocalypse,'' published in 1979, used the image of the building deteriorating to symbolize corrosion of the communist system. Other Poles interviewed suggested erecting monuments to Stalinist victims. A history teacher said publishing a history book `` with no blank spots'' would be a fitting tribute.

 Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, reacting to television ads aimed at him by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, said Friday his new role was to `` take all the heat and the criticism'' from the Democrats and he would do it `` very energetically.'' `` We're delighted to be the lightning rod for the campaign,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` instead of have the heat and the target be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` I've taken heat before and I'll stay in the kitchen, as they say,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator spoke with reporters as he left fund-raisers in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and a rally at a high school in <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. He then traveled to <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> for a rally. Since his debate with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has shrugged off polls suggesting many voters still doubt his qualifications and think he lost the confrontation with the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator. At one point Friday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked to justify his post-debate assertions this week that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, `` looks down on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` He does look down on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; he's got an idea that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> somehow is not a growth-oriented country,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` The governor himself looks down and takes a very liberal viewpoint towards <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and that is looking down on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> earlier said he was not concerned about the new <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ads, one of which notes that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had chosen <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to replace him should tragedy occur and says, `` Hopefully we will never know how great a lapse of judgment that really was.'' `` I have n't seen them. I've heard about them. They obviously do n't have anything bad to say about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and that's fine with me,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters as he toured a <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, technical school. When he was asked at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> appearance to elaborate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` I think that is the new role _ that I'm going to take all the heat and the criticism.'' `` That is my new assignment and I am willing to take it on very energetically,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. Later, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters on his campaign plane that it was his decision to take on the role of `` lightning rod.'' `` I assigned the role to myself. ... I'm going to be taking all the heat and that's just fine. We'll let <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have a free ride,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> asserted that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was pulling much of his organization out of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> because `` they've lost the South.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign officials have denied any such pullout. At <ORGANIZATION> Etowah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was greeted by students waving small <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags and cheering. The school presented him with a ceramic quail. He took questions from the students, who wanted to know how he would safeguard women's rights, <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> and care for the elderly. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a Spanish teacher, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` a real charismatic type of person.'' However, his comments, all from his stump campaign speeches, did n't satisfy everybody. `` He avoided the questions, all of them,'' said <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON>, 17. Another student, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, 15, also thought he went `` around the questions.'' At the tour of the <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION> technical school, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> helped demonstrate a computer-controlled robot paint sprayer. The sprayer doused a blackboard with water and then <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> aimed it in the direction of the press corps. `` That's for all those articles you've written about me,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Officials in a small town clashed with citizens demanding their ouster and a soldier guarding the officials shot and killed one of the demonstrators, an independent radio station reported Friday. Some Haitians said Thursday's confrontation in <LOCATION> Desdunes </LOCATION>, 150 miles north of the capital, was one of several indicating the military government is clamping down on the reform movement launched by a Sept. 17 soldiers' rebellion. In unrelated fighting about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Desdunes </LOCATION>, two people were killed Friday in a feud between members of two families over land and hundreds of people fled their homes fearing a massacre, according to Radio Haiti-Inter. Radio Haiti-Inter said the fight in <LOCATION> Desdunes </LOCATION> began after groups representing youths, peasants and planters met to formulate demands for disarming members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION> and repressive government officials. The Tonton Macoutes were the private militia that supported the 29-year dictatorship of the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family. The demonstrators took to the streets intending to shut down government offices, the broadcast said. Before they got to the courthouse they were blocked by `` The Steamroller,'' a group of henchmen and city officials led by Mayor <PERSON> Anthenor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercius </PERSON>, the radio said. The mayor's group, guarded by soldiers, threw rocks at the protesters, and four soldiers protecting the demonstrators withdrew to their barracks, the broadcast said. It said a soldier in the mayor's group, Sgt. <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valco </ORGANIZATION>, killed a youth identified as <ORGANIZATION> Evarol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racine </ORGANIZATION> and wounded another man in the foot. Four other demonstrators were injured by rocks, the radio said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON>, an economist who ran for the region's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in November's violently aborted national elections, said the town is a stronghold of the <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON> noted that on Sunday, the government said it was temporarily suspending the search for <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday, soldiers killed a squatter in the capital, and on Thursday they dispersed a demonstration in the town of <LOCATION> Port-de-Paix </LOCATION>, he said. The government believes `` the social potential of the soldiers' reform movement is too high, it must be reduced and checked,'' <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON> said The enlisted men of the Presidential Guard overthrew the military government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> in a bloodless coup on Sept. 17 and named Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to replace him. The soldiers demanded an improvement in living conditions for themselves, the ouster of unpopular military and government officials, and a return to the 1987 Constitution, which <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> suspended. In the initial reaction to the coup, people across the country chased down, killed and burned several <LOCATION> Tonton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macoutes </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON> said <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has consolidated his power and promoted non-commissioned officers to bring them into line. `` Avril is successfully bringing off a vast seduction campaign on behalf of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid,'' <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON> said. `` But the fist in the velvet glove is iron.'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio-Metropole </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that Haitian employees of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> petitioned for immediate resumption of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. Two-thirds of the $ 90 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid package was cut off last year when November's elections were canceled. Thugs supported by the army attacked and killed 34 people at the polls. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> took over after dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in February 1986. <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> ruled after the 1971 death of his father, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, who took over in 1957. Radio Haiti-Inter said its reporter in <LOCATION> Estere </LOCATION>, 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, said one person was was shot to death, another was killed by machete blows and `` many people'' were clubbed or stoned in fighting Friday in the fertile <LOCATION> Artibonite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. It said the feud involves members of the Hatier and <PERSON> Bercourt </PERSON> families who have had violent disputes for years over land ownership. The report said that after a fatal shooting, <PERSON> Hatier </PERSON> property near <LOCATION> Estere </LOCATION> was invaded by members of the Desdunes-based <PERSON> Bercourt </PERSON> and in the fighting, hundreds of residents fled the area in panic. It said police made one arrest and called for reinforcements to help restore calm. In July 1987, more than 250 people were killed near the town of <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabel </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Artibonite </LOCATION> province in battles involving a dispute between an association of landless peasants and a coalition of landowners and sharecroppers.

 Anti-abortion demonstrators besieging women's clinics here called in reinforcements to continue their week of protests, saying Friday's 53 arrests had nearly exhausted their pool of people willing to go to jail More than 400 people have been arrested since Tuesday for trying to block clinics as part of a campaign by <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, the group that organized protests during the Democratic National Convention in July. About 500 people attended Operation Rescue's nightly rally Friday night at a suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> church. Rally leaders said that in addition to the usual activity at abortion clinics, a demonstration would be held Saturday outside the city jail where the arrested protesters are being held. Operation Rescue spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON> predicted Saturday could be the biggest day of the `` Siege of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' Those arrested Friday had blocked two driveway entrances to the Midtown Clinic. Police appeared to treat them more gently than those arrested earlier this week. On previous days, police roughly dragged demonstrators who refused to walk to waiting vans and buses bound for jail. They also dragged those arrested Friday, but more carefully, with only the demonstrators' feet touching the ground. `` I believe the public would rather see us take more time and be more gentle,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON>. During the arrests of one group, <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON> asked demonstrators leaning against a clinic gate in the early morning chill if they would walk to the buses `` like gentlemen and ladies.'' Few did. The picketing followed what demonstrators called an `` end run'' by clinic operators the day before, in which patients were whisked inside before demonstrators arrived. Midtown administrator <PERSON> Ignatius </PERSON> <PERSON> deBlasi </PERSON> said about 80 percent of the patients with appointments Friday showed up; the clinic usually handles 25-30 women daily. As one woman was escorted through protesters trying to block the back gate, they said to her, `` Have mercy on your son or daughter.'' After the arrests, small groups held hands during Bible readings or sang hymns on the sidewalk outside the clinic. Pro-choice advocates, who say the decision on abortion should be the mother's, not the state's, have escorted patients to clinics but decided against counterdemonstrations to avoid making the situation more difficult, they said. Some pro-choice supporters were on hand at Midtown, one carrying a sign denouncing `` coat-hanger therapy,'' a reference to often-fatal `` back-alley'' abortions that they say women would be forced into if abortion were outlawed. `` It's like this rail here,'' said an abortion opponent to a pro-choice advocate. `` You are on one side or the other.'' As of Friday afternoon, 38 of the 421 people arrested this week had been released on bail, usually set at $ 650. Operation Rescue officials complained that their sympathizers were being denied release on bail. `` There's no truth to it at all,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotton </PERSON> at the jail where many of the protesters are being held. `` They may have requested bond, but they have n't finished the processing.''

 A fire at a rural gun factory Friday killed four people, destroyed the building and forced firefighters to retreat as bullets whizzed by them, authorities said. The bodies of four people were recovered from the rubble of the Buffalo Rock Shooters Supply, which makes ammunition and machine guns for police departments around the country, authorities said. `` It was a big ball of fire with a couple of explosions. There were a lot of bullets flying,'' said <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Dettore </PERSON>, fire chief of <PERSON> Naplate </PERSON>, a town about four miles east of the factory. <PERSON> Dettore </PERSON> said workers were believed to have been making bullets when the first explosion hit about 11:30 a.m. in the main building, which also housed the company's general offices and gun shop. The official cause was unknown, but fire investigators suspect a spark may have ignited gunpowder used to make bullets, he said. <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> is about 70 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It started in the main bulding where they make ammunition and sell guns,'' <PERSON> Dettore </PERSON> said. `` A place like that with all that black powder _ just the dust, if you get a spark in there that's all it's going to take They had cases and cases and cases of all kinds of ammunition, all kinds of guns.'' The victims had not been positively identified Friday night and <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> said through a spokesman that the process would n't be finished until Saturday. <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON>, the coroner's secretary, said a forensic dentist was summoned to help identify the bodies. When firefighters arrived at the company's complex, they began battling the blaze as bullets whizzed through the air, <PERSON> Dettore </PERSON> said. `` It's not as dangerous as if it was shot out of a gun itself,'' the fire chief said. `` It gets a little scary when you get a big explosion.'' But <PERSON> Dettore </PERSON> said that when he found out the buildings contained substantial amounts of gunpowder, he ordered the 40 firefighters to retreat about a half mile. They stayed away for about 45 minutes and resumed fighting the fire about 1 p.m., <PERSON> Dettore </PERSON> said. They had most of the fire put out in about an hour, though small fires still flared. More than 120 firefighters battled the blaze.

<HEAD>Electric Boat Strike Negotiations End Without Contract Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three days of marathon contract negotiations ended Friday night without a resolution to the 3-month-old strike at the Electric Boat shipyard in <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, a manufacturer of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> nuclear submarines. Labor and company negotiators met with federal mediators in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for about 30 hours since Wednesday, but could not reach an accord to end the wage dispute. Friday was day 99 of the strike. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said they would be in contact with both parties, but no further negotiating sessions were set. Representatives from the sub-building division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said they reoffered their previous proposal, a four-year contract with bonuses and a one-time 3 percent wage increase. The <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group representing all the striking unions, had said it wanted a three-year contract with 4 percent raises in at least the second and third years. In a prepared statement, the company said, `` It appears that this unnecessary and illegal strike will continue indefinitely as will the hiring of permanent replacements.'' The bargaining sessions with the mediation service were the first major negotiations since another round of federally mediated talks broke off in August without an agreement. Hopes were high that the strike would be settled this week as pressure mounted on the union. More than 1,500 of the original 10,000 striking workers have crossed picket lines and returned to work. And a key union, the <ORGANIZATION> Boilermakers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that it wanted the strike settled immediately, fearing the job action may be declared illegal. Electric Boat could fire striking workers if the strike is found to be illegal. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> official has questioned the strike's legality because it did not receive a strike notification 30 days in advance from the <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> as required by law. The union sent the notification to the wrong address. MTC officials have said they believe the strike is legal because they notified federal officials orally of the strike plan. Electric Boat is the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s sole producer of the giant Trident nuclear submarines and competes annually with the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> -RRB- Shipbuilding & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Drydock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for contracts to build the smaller, SSN-688 fast attack subs. The company said it needs to hold down labor costs to remain competitive for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> submarine contracts. Electric Boat, one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s largest employers, normally has 18,000 workers at the <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION> plant and another 6,000 at its <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, facility. The <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> workers did not strike.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, for only the second time in its history, publicly reprimanded a judge Friday, rebuking him for 14 judicial indiscretions that included waving a gun from the bench. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was summoned before the court and accused by Chief Justice <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON> of sullying his reputation and his family name. `` This is probably one of the most distateful chores that I have had to perform,'' <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON> told <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> and a courtroom audience of about 50 people. The <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Qualifications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> found <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> guilty of the 14 counts of misconduct. The commission said that besides waving a handgun twice in hearings, <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> failed for 19 years to keep adequate records of a $ 20,000 estate he managed for a blind and incompetent family friend. It said he should have transferred the account when he became a judge in 1973. <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>, whose father, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>, was <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president in 1951-53 and an appeals judge, listened with downcast eyes to the reprimand. `` For more than 15 years you in the exercise of your judicial duties have stood in judgment of others. Today, you are the one being judged,'' said <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>, adding that it was a `` lack of corrupt motives and the absence of moral turpitude'' that kept the commission from recommending <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>' removal. <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> said nothing to the court and left without comment. In earlier hearings, an attorney for <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> said he pulled the gun because of a `` startle reflex.'' He said the judge had been the victim of an attack and was nervous about courthouse security. The last judge ordered to appear before the court for reprimand was Circuit Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, who was rebuked two years ago for violating legal ethics before he joined the bench, said <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, clerk of the court. Usually, the court issues reprimands in writing.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> couple, caught in the 1985 terrorist hijacking of the <LOCATION> Mediteranean </LOCATION> cruise ship <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON>, sued the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> on Friday for more than $ 11 million. The lawsuit, filed at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, accused the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of false imprisonment, assault and battery and intentionally inflicting emotional distress on <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodes </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON>, a 24,000-ton Italian liner, was seized Oct. 7, 1983, off <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> by terrorists identifying themselves as members of a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> splinter group, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The terrorists demanded the release of 50 Palestinians held in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. One wheelchair-bound American passenger, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON>, 69, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was killed by the terrorists before they left the vessel Oct. 9. The lawsuit described the Hodeses as `` long-standing friends'' of <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>. After the hijackers left the ship, the lawsuit said, Mrs. <PERSON> Hodes </PERSON> learned `` from the captain that she was to be the next victim,'' if the ordeal had continued. According to the lawsuit, the acts of terrorism on the <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> were directed by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` to terrorize <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens, especially those such as the Hodeses of Jewish faith.'' According to the lawsuit, <PERSON> Hodes </PERSON> was off the vessel with 600 other passengers for a one-day excursion to see the Egyptian pyramids when the terrorists seized the ship, and the remaining passengers _ including his wife and 11 other Americans.

 Opposition leaders said Friday that they want President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> out of office before 1990, despite his vow to complete his term after losing a referendum. Hundreds of thousands celebrated the `` no'' vote. Ten people were wounded, two seriously, when soldiers fired on celebrants in passing cars, a radio station reported. Six journalists in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> to cover the referendum also were slightly injured when they were caught between riot police and demonstrators Friday night near the national palace. Four of the injured required treatment at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clinic </LOCATION> for head wounds. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a moderate Socialist prominent in the 16-party opposition alliance, said the president, who is also army commander, has `` too great an ambition for power'' and should heed the message this week by voters `` who said ` No more.''' Hundreds of thousands of Chileans swayed and sang along with some of the country's most popular music groups in a park Friday in an opposition celebration. No politicians spoke and the music was pointedly non-political, but people chanted on their own: `` <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON>, Get Out Pinochet!'' and `` He's Going to Fall!'' People bound for the park in buses and packed automobiles chanted anti-government slogans and waved anti-Pinochet banners. Police estimated the crowd at up to 350,000. A free presidential election is to be held late next year because of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s loss in the yes-or-no referendum Wednesday on whether he should remain in office until 1997. He can run in that election if he chooses. The winner takes office in March 1990 and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said Thursday night he will not permit changes in the election schedule and he vowed not to leave office early. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> took power in a September 1973 coup that ousted Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. While there was a peaceful gathering in the capital's biggest park on a warm hazy afternoon, there was violence elsewhere later. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperativa </ORGANIZATION>, an independent news station, reported soldiers outside an army barracks near the park fired buckshot and pellets at people in passing cars who flashed the V sign for victory. It said two people were seriously wounded and eight were treated at <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> Central Emergency Hospital. A hospital spokesman told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> nine people were treated for gunshot wounds and a 10th was taken to a neurological hospital. Several hundred youths leaving the rally behind the national palace tried to stage a demonstration. Police, anticipating trouble, blocked the street off to traffic, then scattered the youths with water cannon and tear gas. The demonstrators regrouped, however. During the charge, riot police kicked and lashed with nightsticks at newsmen. `` We were crouched behind a fruit stand _ not in the way and trying to get out of the way,'' <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> said. `` It happened so quick, nobody flashed -LRB- photographed -RRB- them. We did nothing to draw attention to us.'' Opposition leaders have requested talks with the government on amending the constitution and speeding <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s departure. <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> said the administration might become more flexible later. `` You have to give the defeated a couple of days to recover from the shock,'' he said. `` Let's talk more seriously about it next week.'' He said the opposition should unify in its bid for an earlier election, declaring: `` If we join together with more force, I think the situation will change.'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said the government would negotiate with the opposition only `` if it was necessary.'' <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Plata </PERSON>, the labor minister, said: `` These people participated in the referendum and have to abide by the rules of the game.'' <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> spoke to reporters outside a federal prison where he visited a more radical Socialist, <PERSON> Clodomiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylmeda </PERSON>, who is serving a 541-day term on charges of promoting political violence through public anti-government statements. Whether <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> can resist opposition pressure is expected to depend on support from his army, and no splits in the ranks were evident Friday. Gen. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibanez </PERSON>, governor of the southern <ORGANIZATION> Eighth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted Friday by <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Epoca </PERSON>, a moderate <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> daily, as saying: `` We have lost a battle, but not the war. This is an electoral defeat for the governent, but from the military point of view it's no more than a battle. He accused voters of `` ingratitude,'' the report said. The navy, air force and national police are generally seen as more willing to negotiate with the opposition but lack the army's size and political clout <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s 1980 constitution gives the military autonomy and an influential role in national policy under a democratic government.

 Actress <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> filed for divorce Friday from heavyweight boxing champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> after a turbulent eight-month marriage she called `` a continuous horror story'' of destruction, drinking and domestic violence. In filing for the divorce, the actress also won a court order to keep him away from her and the <ORGANIZATION> Burbank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> set where her ABC series, `` Head of the Class'' is taped. The divorce petition filed in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> cited irreconcilable differences as Miss <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>' reason to end the marriage to <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, 22, whose wealth is estimated at $ 40 million. In an attached declaration, Miss <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, 23, recounts an alleged attack last Sunday in the couple's mansion in <LOCATION> Bernardsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` I was awakened by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s hitting about my body and my head with his closed fist and open hand. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> appeared, by his actions and by his breath, to be intoxicated and I discovered that he had been drinking champagne early in the morning,'' the declaration continued. `` I was frightened for my life and terrorized.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> retained high-powered local attorney <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> for the divorce battle. <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> successfully defended automaker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON> against cocaine trafficking charges. `` I think <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is disappointed, given the circumstances, that the relationship has resolved itself in the manner it has. In a sense he is relieved that he could put his life back in order and could go on with his life,'' <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> said. He declined comment on the divorce action until he and <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> see it. `` I think there has been a lot of press about <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and his relationship with <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>. I think <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> would just like to go back to being the champion of the world,'' <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, who is in town working on the TV series, did n't appear at a courthouse news conference at which <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelson </PERSON>, the celebrity divorce lawyer, announced the divorce action <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON>, who filed the petition for Miss <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacBeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> issued a restraining order barring the fighter from approaching the actress. Other orders require him to move from Miss <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home without removing any possessions, and to to stay at least 1,000 feet from the actress, her home and her work place. <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> said he was n't ready to say how much of <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s fortune the actress would seek <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s community property law entitles a spouse to 50 percent of a couple's earnings during their marriage. Referring to the alleged attack Sunday, Miss <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> said in her declaration: `` The above described incident was the latest in a continuous horror story for me. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> has repeatedly hit me, threw things at me, threatened to kill me'' and also threatened to kill her mother, her sister, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, and an employee. <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> still cared about her husband, despite the alleged violence, which the actress has previously described in a televised interview. `` She loves <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>. She tried to protect <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and nurture him. She wishes him every good thing in life,'' <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- there's continued violence and she fears for her safety.'' <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> has also represented actress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and was the lawyer in a landmark `` palimony'' decision against the late actor <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>. In an interview with <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20-20'' a week ago, Miss <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> said her husband has an `` extremely volatile temper'' and that life with him was `` torture ... pure hell.'' She said she's become very afraid of him, but gave no indication she wanted to end the marriage. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, the youngest heavyweight champion ever, told <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> that he loves his wife and would not stand in her way if she chose to leave. `` My wife would just have to ask for it and she has every penny I have,'' said <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> told Miss <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> is a manic-depressive, but a doctor who examined the heavyweight champ said this week he is not. Friends of Tyson have accused Miss <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> and her mother, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, of manipulating <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> in order to gain control of his $ 40 million fortune. Days after the interview, police went to the couple's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> mansion to try to calm <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, at the request of Miss <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> and her mother, because the champ reportedly had flown into a rage and hurled furniture through the windows. It was another incident in a stormy year for Tyson. He gave away a $ 100,000 automobile after a minor accident, cracked a bone in his hand in a late-night fight on a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> street and was reported to have threatened suicide before slamming his car into a tree last month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A newspaper report also said <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had several violent episodes and chased Miss <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> and her mother in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> hotel when the actress was there filming an episode of the series last month. The couple was married Feb. 7 in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> All-Star </ORGANIZATION> game, which <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> attended. But because the couple did not have an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> license, they were remarried two days later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 A woman whose brother's killer escaped from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' prison furlough program and attacked a couple in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> took her criticism of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Friday in a trip financed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters. `` I think it's at a point in this country where the prisoners' rights have superseded and taken over,'' said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Fournier </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, whose 17-year-old brother, <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Fournier </PERSON>, was murdered in 1974 by <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> `` The victims are not heard,'' she added, saying, `` Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, I do n't feel, would address this issue.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> endorsed Republican Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the presidency, but the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> man who was attacked by <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> after his escape, refused to endorse anyone at the news conference. `` This is n't political to my wife and I,'' said <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a former resident of <LOCATION> Oxon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, explaining his non-partisan position. Both <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said their expenses for their trip to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> on Friday and to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> next week were being paid by the Committee for the Presidency, a group formed to support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy. But <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said he wanted to address only the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' furlough program, saying, `` It's not a successful program. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> had been serving a life sentence without parole in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Fournier </PERSON>'s murder when he walked away from his 10th release on weekend furlough. He broke into the <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' home in April 1987. <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> was slashed 22 times and then tied up by <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>. His then-fiancee and now wife, <PERSON> Angi </PERSON>, was beaten and raped twice. The Democrats' response to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> attacks on the program have consisted of `` a bunch of misleading statistics that hide the faces and the lives of the real victims,'' said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. `` I will never understand it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said of a program allowing the weekend furlough of a first-degree murderer. `` To me, it does not make sense.'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> also said that as governor, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has refused to meet with them about crimes committed by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> convicts while on weekend furloughs or work-release programs. They also asserted that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> resisted efforts to prohibit first-degree murderers from participating in the state furlough program. In April, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> signed legislation to enact just such a change in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> program. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began pressing the furlough issue, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign fired back with statistics showing that the furlough escape rate in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has been below the national average. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> officials also contend that more than 40 states have furlough programs for convicted felons, and at least 23 states make first-degree murderers eligible for furloughs. The Democrats also invoked the record of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who supported the furlough program in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ even after two convicts killed people while on furlough in late 1971 and early 1972. At the time of the murders in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, former <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, now a Republican state senator, complained to then-Gov. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that `` about 40 percent of our serious and violent offenders are on active parole from your <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>.'' Both <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> inherited their respective state furlough programs, and both defended the programs from political attacks that arose following crimes committed by convicts on furlough.

<HEAD>Cypriot President Calls For Demilitarization Of Island Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> on Thursday called for demilitarization of his <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island nation, where a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force separates the hostile Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities. `` We propose to dismantle the military forces of the Republic -LRB- of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> -RRB- if all Turkish troops and settlers withdraw and if the armed elements they have fostered are disbanded,'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> told delegates to the 43rd General Assembly. In 1974, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s military junta sponsored a coup on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> that failed. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority, and still occupies about 40 percent of the northern part of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The northern part of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> declared itself to be the `` <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>'' in 1975, a breakaway state recognized only by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. About 200,000 Greek Cypriots fled the northern section during the invasion and tens of thousands of Turks have since come to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to settle there. `` We undertake to use the funds which will be saved through demilitarization for the development of areas of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> which have fallen behind economically and primarily for projects which will benefit mainly the Turkish Cypriots,'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> proposed. `` Part of the savings could also be used for financing the international peace force to be established,'' he added. The current 2,300-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peacekeeping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> is funded by voluntary contributions of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> first suggested this plan in June at the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s Special Session on Disarmament. He said the solution of the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem is defined in <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions that call for all foreign troops and settlers to leave the island; that call for respect for human rights; and that say no other nation has a right to intervene in Cypriot internal affairs. `` We believe that in the future federal Republic of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> that we envision all Cypriots, whether <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> or Turkish, should enjoy equality of opportunity and fundamental freedoms including the right to develop their distinctive cultural heritages,'' he said. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> has met with <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>, president of the breakaway Turkish republic on northen <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, to discuss reunification of the island. The talks were held at the invitation of Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. `` The target is to achieve a just and lasting solution of the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem by June 1989,'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said. In his speech to the General Asssembly, <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> also called for worldwide military cutbacks, with the major lending nations using the savings to establish national funds to buy at the present discounted market rates the outstanding loans owed to their commercial banks by developing nations. `` The cost of these national debt relief programs would be minimal if they are coupled with an imaginative use of tax credits,'' he said.

<HEAD>Official Admits Errors But Still Backs Dam Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The environment minister said Thursday that government failure to consult the public about a planned dam project generated opposition to the project, but he still backed construction of the dam. `` We can now see clearly that the absence of openness ... has done a lot of damage,'' <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marothy </PERSON> said in Parliament of a government report on the dam and hydroelectric power plant communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are building on the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION>. `` Leaving out of consideration indications of public opinion has produced mistrust and in fact raised antipathy.'' Dozens of parliamentarians have asked to speak on the report and several are likely to vote against it. However, government officials and parliamentarians say it will probably be adopted Friday. The joint Gabcikovo-Nagymaros project has met considerable opposition in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and dozens of independent environmental and other interest groups have publicly called for a halt in construction. The groups claim it will cause irreparable ecological damage to wetland and wildlife along the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> and pollute large drinking water reserves. <PERSON> Marothy </PERSON>, however, told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> the barrage system `` must be built in keeping with the original concept.'' `` The government must take responsibility for society as a whole, even if the price of this is that it must act against the opinions of some groups,'' <PERSON> Marothy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marothy </PERSON> argued the issue has become largely symbolic in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for other social problems. `` What has become superimposed on these disputes is the sum of tensions, social problems and contradictions emerging, ... including claims for remedying grievances that have nothing to do with the dam,'' he said. On Sept. 12, about 20,000 people gathered in front of Parliament to protest the project, calling for democracy, a multiparty system and a referendum. <PERSON> Marothy </PERSON> rejected the conclusions of an ad hoc committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> which presented its findings to the government Oct. 1, charging they were `` inaccurate.'' The Academy report, as quoted by <PERSON> Marothy </PERSON>, said stopping or delaying construction posed a `` realistic alternative'' and postponing work could reduce economic burdens and entail fewer environmental risks.

 The nation's top business leaders today offered an optimistic view of economic prospects, predicting growth will slow enough next year to avoid a severe acceleration of inflation. The Business Council, composed of 62 chief executives of the country's largest corporations, predicted that the economy, as measured by the gross national product, will grow 4 percent in 1988, the best in four years. `` We are living in a continued strong economy,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest bank. `` We are very close to full employment, and the inflation numbers ... are generally felt to be in pretty good shape.'' The new GNP prediction, reflecting the consensus of the chief economists of about 20 member corporations, is 1.6 percentage points better than the prediction last May when the executives last gathered for their semiannual retreat at this resort town in the mountains of western <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

 `` The Mind,'' an ambitious and emotionally charged PBS series starting Wednesday, is in many ways the ultimate `` behind-the-scenes'' television program. Aided by computers and X-ray scanners, the nine-part series goes inside the brain to see the formation of thoughts and feelings that surge behind human acts, whether mundane or deeply disturbing. The shows popularize theories that have emerged in the brain and mind sciences in two decades when the cost of direct treatment of severe mental illness is estimated to have reached $ 25 billion a year. The most eloquent moments come in vivid interviews with people who try to explain, sometimes in tears, anger, or bewilderment, what was happening in their mind when mental disease devasted their lives and families. These case studies go a long way toward helping the series achieve one of its goals: to erase the stigma of mental illness. Lurking in the back of `` The Mind'' are controversial questions which the series implies but does not answer: Should brain and mind be probed chemically or by computer to find out how people will act? When and how much should chemicals, cells or genes in humans be altered to change the functions of the mind? And who should make those decisions? But the shows, six years in the making at the cost of $ 8 million, do not shirk controversy. `` The series starts with a controversial statement: The mind is what the brain does. A lot of people do n't necessarily think that. Even today there are still dualists who think that the mind and the brain may be separate,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, who created the series and is executive editor. `` In our ` aging' show, I'm very optimistic about the newest work that indicates that aging is less of a deterioration than was thought. I think there is controversy also in our ` addiction' show which really debunks the notion ` Just say no;' and in our ` pain and healing' show which I think is a responsible report on where we stand in looking at how the mind heals the body,'' <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said in an interview. Other one-hour segments examine consciousness, development, depression, language, and thought; 90 minutes is devoted to the violent mind. Each has interviews with about a dozen specialists mostly from medical schools in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad. The program follows the 1984 series `` The Brain'' and has an advisory board of 10 experts. One of the more dramatic `` behind-the-scenes'' techniques displays how groups of brain cells are activated while a volunteer with a mild radioactive injection is strapped in a scanner and speaks or reads. Such experiments help researchers understand language development and offer hope for the treatment of complex mental diseases. The shows use computer-generated visual effects to detail mechanisms behind the spark of an idea or the shift of a mood. PacMan-like graphics which trace chemical paths that transmit pain or pleasure also illustrate theories on how the mind can be derailed by drugs, chemicals in the workplace, stress or illness. The series also asks why one person becomes a genius musician, another a psychopathic murderer. Are states of mind influenced more by environment, biochemicals or genes? Is the brain `` hard-wired'' to sway moods or patterns of thought? Narrator <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, exuding rational optimism, points to some answers that hint at possible profound changes in the treatment of mental disease and the handling of criminals. Some changes, he cautions, may be decades away. While `` The Mind'' is encyclopedic, it has shortcomings. Chief among these is its avoidance of some darker implications of research: mind control, brainwashing or mass media manipulation. And although one show has an interview with a survivor of a Soviet prison camp, the series does not examine abuses of psychiatric treatment on political dissidents. `` We did n't go into brainwashing. It's something I'm kind of interested in, and it did n't happen,'' <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said. `` We thought about it a lot. We decided for a lot of reasons not to do it, but we certainly considered that notion.'' The TV version also suffers from some historical absent-mindedness. There's a brief clip of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and cheering masses, but the only identification of one of history's most brutal madmen is in a caption in the companion book by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Restak </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> comes up in radiation studies on fetal brain cells. But the only explanation that it was the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing that hastened the end of World War II is in the series' educational supplement produced with funding from <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and distributed to 7,000 high schools.

 Producer <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Noxon </PERSON> acknowledges that telling the story of 100 years of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> presented a few sticky problems. First of all, how do you get a century of exploration around the world, and in recent years out of this world, into a 90-minute documentary? `` We adopted a pretty pragmatic attitude,'' said <PERSON> Noxon </PERSON>, whose production of `` The Explorers: A Century of Discovery'' is his latest for National Geographic. `` The formula I worked out was that we would put in film on all the important things from the past 100 years and leave everything else out. `` Once I resigned myself to the coffee-table concept, once we got comfortable with that, it worked out pretty well. If we applied too rigid a test we'd leave out things we wanted in. We came up with ` The Explorers' for the title. If we strayed too far from that we were n't true to the theme.'' <PERSON> Noxon </PERSON> also faced the problem of keeping it from becoming just a cut-and-paste job. `` One of our dilemmas was that after all the musts we did n't have much time for electives,'' he said `` Certain things just had to go in. We wanted to add some new film, but it was very limiting.'' New film for the 100th anniversary documentary includes a sequence on mapping the sky at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palomar </LOCATION> and a look at the <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> home of Geographic founder <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. Appropriately, `` The Explorers'' will be telecast on Columbus Day, Wednesday, on PBS. The show is largely told with archival photographs and film, much of it never before seen on television. Associate editor <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON>, an Emmy winner for `` Secrets of the Titanic,'' worked closely with <PERSON> Noxon </PERSON> in putting the film together. Among the highlights: _ Conquest of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s flight over the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION>; _ Exploration of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Valley of 10,000 Smokes in 1917, the first Geographic expedition to be documented in motion pictures; _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON>'s descent a half-mile into the ocean depths in a bathysphere; _ Harrowing exploration of the stratosphere in a hydrogen-filled balloon by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> officers in 1934; and _ A 1931 French motor expedition from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to Peking, including an attempt `` I came here in 1960 after doing some educational and institutional films in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Noxon </PERSON> said. `` I went to work for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolper </PERSON> in 1965, when he was doing documentaries. I fancied myself a documentarian, and <PERSON> Wolper </PERSON> was like a rocket then. I started doing the Geographic specials with <PERSON> Wolper </PERSON>. The first one I did was ` Voyage of the <ORGANIZATION> Brigantine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>.' The next one I did was ` Dr. <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> and the Dawn of Man.''' <PERSON> Noxon </PERSON> left <PERSON> Wolper </PERSON> after six years, but then returned to do more Geographic specials. In later years, he produced the specials for WQED-TV in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noxon </PERSON> recently joined ABC-Kane Productions, founded by <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, former head of television for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, in association with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. He has made documentaries on wildlife, early <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, diving for Spanish treasure, transatlantic liners and many other subjects. `` It's amazing what television's been willing to deal with,'' he said. `` Those of us in the West have rarely succeeded in placing news-oriented shows with the networks. We were able to get in with the wildlife shows. In 1966, I was able to talk about ecology, which was certainly an unknown word then, in a show about the grizzly bear. We were able to offer the hard idea that the grizzlies were disappearing and were worth saving. `` I got thrown out of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> for a show on the vanishing elephant. That was another unpopular idea. Elephants eat the same food as people, and people kill the elephants. What can we do? I do n't think we've answered that yet. `` But I think by protecting their monopoly on documentaries the networks have missed a lot. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>' company is the first semiautonomous documentary production group started by a network in many years.''

<HEAD>The Best Investment of All</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Whenever homeowners feel frustrated by tales of huge profits in the stock market they should remind themselves that they have the best investment of all. Securities prices collapse every now and then, but housing prices generally hold their own. You store stocks in a safe-deposit box but you can live in a house. You pay big taxes on securities gains; on houses, you can defer them. The advantages do n't end there. You may pay for your house in easy monthly installments, but payments for stocks are up front. You can fix up your house and increase the value, but you have little say in a corporate investment. But perhaps the greatest security of a housing investment _ after providing shelter for a family _ is the stability of the investment. Year in and year out, houses generally appreciate, even when you think they're not. In 1981, the median sale price of existing single-family homes, measured by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, was $ 66,400. In 1987, the figure was $ 85,400, and through August of this year it had risen to $ 91,300. National figures can hide regional discrepancies, of course, but all four sections of the country participated in the the housing-price advance. From 1981 through August, prices in the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> jumped from $ 63,700 to $ 144,800. In spite of a manufacturing recession and various farm problems, they rose in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> from $ 54,300 to $ 70,500; in the South from $ 64,400 to $ 84,300, and in the West, from $ 96,200 to $ 122,000. In no year since 1981 has the median price failed to gain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The price did fall in the Northeast from 1981 to 1982, but by only $ 200. In the West it declined in both 1982 and 1985 _ but quickly recovered. Such stability is unknown in most other markets. True, the stock market may have risen at a sharper rate, but the comparison is n't entirely valid You can have 50 percent margin in stocks _ but in housing you might have 90 percent. In effect, a homeowner who puts up 10 percent of a home's price _ the rest coming from the bank _ participates in any price increase as if he or she owned 100 percent. It is a degree of leverage almost unknown in securities. Leverage and compounding produce financial miracles. An owner who makes a $ 10,000 downpayment on a $ 100,000 house earns 50 percent if that house rises 5 percent to $ 105,000 in one year. As with the purchase of anything, there may be drawbacks in owning a house. Generally, housing is less liquid than stocks. While prices might not collapse, markets become inactive every few years. Selling means legal expenses too. But if you do sell and buy a more expensive dwelling you generally can defer capital gains taxes. Your entire housing equity can be protected from any taxes so long as the more recently acquired house remains your property. If you attempt to do that with your stock profits you'll invite the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> into your affairs. When you sell stocks you pay taxes on the profits; even if you reinvest in other stocks there is no deferment. Whenever you have the feeling that your pals are making a killing in the securities markets, therefore, you should sit back and count your blessings. And dwell on the very real probability that their latest winning effort in the market did n't even offset their losses.

<HEAD>Mixed Reviews for Market `Circuit Breakers' Plan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If all goes as expected, the nation's stock markets will soon embark on an experiment they hope never gets put to the test. The plan, now awaiting approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, calls for `` circuit breakers'' that would halt all trading for set periods of time if stock prices fall by specified amounts on any given day. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> would stop trading for one hour if the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 250 points. After that, if the Dow fell 150 points more in the same session, trading would be halted for two hours. The system, developed by the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, would also provide that the prices of stock index futures traded on the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> would be effectively frozen for 30 minutes if they declined by an amount roughly equivalent to 100 Dow points. The proposal was made `` contingent on adoption by all domestic markets.'' <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the plan might hit a snag because of opposition from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the over-the-counter market. The <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> does indeed regard the plan as `` a bad solution'' to the issues raised by the market crash last October, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON>, the organization's president, said in an interview. But he indicated his group would go along with whatever the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> decides, and said he would be surprised if the commission did not approve the circuit-breaker plan in some form soon. The circuit breakers, along with a series of other measures proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, are designed to supersede the `` collar'' adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> early this year. The collar closed the exchange's main computer trading facilities to orders from professionals engaged in multiple transactions known as index arbitrage whenever the Dow rose or fell 50 points in a day. Other trading, including `` manual'' index arbitrage, was not affected by the collar. In its brief existence, the collar has drawn mixed reviews. And the circuit breaker system has attracted divergent comments as well. To its proponents, it provides a system for everyone involved in the trading process to stop and evaluate the situation if a selling panic hits. Also, they say, it helps answer the call from the presidential commission headed by <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, now secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, for a recognition that activity in stocks and stock-index options and futures be recognized as `` one market.'' Of course, the hope is that the system will help restore investor confidence to the extent that the circuit breakers never actually have to be activated. On the other side of the debate, <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON> says: `` Circuit breakers are likely to increase market volatility rather than curb it. The closer a market gets to a circuit breaker level, the more likely it is to reach it as sellers rush to execute orders under the wire.'' A similar contention, that the limit would tend to become a magnet, was made when the collar was adopted. Experience with the collar has neither proved nor refuted that point. <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON> also cites academic studies that show markets as most volatile when a security is opening or reopening after a trading halt. Industry organizations `` should be striving to keep the markets open,'' he maintains. If the circuit breakers as proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> had been in effect for 50 years, they never would have been activated until last fall. So the statistical chances are not great that the system will be tested during the one-year `` pilot program'' the exchange is calling for. Presumably, the plan's workability would be demonstrated by a healthier performance by stock prices and increases in measures of investor confidence such as price-earnings ratios. But some Wall Streeters do not buy that idea. `` The proposed circuit breakers are no protection at all,'' says <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Legg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Stopping trading for an hour when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> industrials are down 250 points means you've done nothing until the market's plunged 12 percent. Thanks a lot.''

<HEAD>Is $3 Million `Chicken Feed'? All's Relative as Lotto Jackpots

 For the past few months, the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lottery </LOCATION> has been flashing an ad on the scoreboard of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> reminding fans that a $ 3 million lottery jackpot is n't `` chicken feed'' or `` chopped liver.'' During an era when jackpots around the country are regularly topping $ 20 million, the stadium ad is part of a campaign to stir up interest in `` Super Lotto'' prizes that a decade ago would have made newspaper front pages. `` We are looking for an expanded base of players,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lottery </LOCATION> spokeswoman. `` We want the players to understand that $ 3 million is a lot of money. While the giant jackpots get a lot of focus, $ 150,000 -LRB- annual earnings for 20 years in a $ 3 million prize -RRB- is a lot of money.'' The explosion in the size of lottery jackpots may hinder play around the country on games with relatively smaller prizes by dampening enthusiasm about winning a few million dollars, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dworin </PERSON>, publisher of Gaming and <ORGANIZATION> Wagering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> magazine in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> awards a $ 55 million jackpot, and a lot of people are not going to get excited by lower numbers,'' <PERSON> Dworin </PERSON> said. `` Why play when it's $ 10 million if it could be $ 50 million?'' <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s $ 55 million prize, awarded after a Sept. 3 drawing, is the nation's largest lottery jackpot to date. Six of the 10 largest jackpots have been awarded this year, records show. Many state lotteries say it takes a bigger jackpot today to trigger `` lotto mania,'' described as the point when sales increase dramatically and the news media become interested in a prize. In most `` lotto'' contests, participants try to guess a series of numbers to be drawn, and the prize grows if nobody gets the correct match. In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the attitude of players has changed since the state started its lottery in 1974 and introduced a high-payoff lotto game in 1983, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rem </PERSON>, lottery communication director. `` After a lottery has been around a number of years, people get used to it. Our players have gotten more sophisticated,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rem </PERSON> said. Asked when `` lotto mania'' begins, she added, `` If you wanted a number, I'd say $ 20 million.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> recently changed its lottery advertising strategy to attract upscale, casual players, said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Gladieux </PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've completely restructured our advertising to get the person who would n't play for $ 4 million but would play for $ 20 million,'' <PERSON> Gladieux </PERSON> said. `` We've begun featuring well-dressed, well-educated, real people who share their dream of winning, on television.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> operate a tri-state lotto, but with a combined population of less than 3 million and a top jackpot of $ 9.6 million, the contest may never generate `` lotto mania,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisler </PERSON>, games manager for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sweepstakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Provincial Lotteries, said newspaper coverage illustrates how interest has waned in jackpots of a few million dollars. `` In 1983, with a $ 1.4 million winner in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, we got a front page story in The Hartford Courant,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who tracks lotteries in 28 states, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and five Canadian provinces. He said the same lottery story in 1988 probably would n't make the front section of the newspaper. `` People and the press are getting jaded, but most people still realize a million dollars is a lot of money,'' he said. <PERSON> Dworin </PERSON> said one way to increase ticket sales and jackpots is for lotteries to increase the odds of winning. `` If you increase the -LRB- choice of numbers -RRB-, the odds are much longer and therefore even if more people play, there's a higher chance of rollover and a higher chance of larger jackpots,'' <PERSON> Dworin </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where buyers select six numbers from a pool of 44, the odds are one in 7 million and the largest prize to date has been $ 32 million. Ms. <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON> said there are several points when sales increase. `` Ten million dollars is the first breaking point where some casual players come in,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON>. `` At $ 13 million to $ 15 million, about 80 percent come in.'' She said once the jackpot exceeds $ 15 billion, just about everyone in the state starts to play except lottery officials who ca n't by law. `` When we get the big jackpots, the attention heightens visibility, which heightens sales, which heightens the jackpot and it just keeps going,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 During 11 years as vice president to <PERSON> Jomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> says, his job was to `` sing the tune'' of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s first president. A decade after <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON>'s death and <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>'s emergence from an understudy to the `` Mzee'' -LRB- Old Man -RRB- to the starring role in Kenyan politics, the schoolteacher-turned-president has taught all would-be challengers to dance to his drums. Through shrewd political maneuvering, the church-going, teetotaling <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>, a member of the minority <LOCATION> Kalengin </LOCATION> tribe, has amassed power that rivals even the lionized <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON>'s. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> is by law a one-party state and <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> is boss of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Kenyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a body he says is supreme to the government. Parliament is essentially a rubber stamp to the president's wishes, and recent constitutional changes have brought the judiciary more under the executive's control <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON>, too, ran <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> with a tight rein and tolerated no dissent. So pervasive was his rule that many doomsayers predicted <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> would be torn apart by tribal warfare after the death of <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON>, who was a member of the predominant Kikuyu tribe. But when the <PERSON> Mzee </PERSON> died on Aug. 22, 1978, <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>, the third and longest-serving of <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON>'s vice presidents, peacefully succeeded him. Within 90 days, as specified by the constitution, <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> called a presidential election. He won it unopposed and was sworn in as <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s second president Oct. 14, 1978, the date he observes as the beginning of his presidency. In the following months, government officials released details of what they said had been a plot during <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON>'s waning days to kill <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> rather than allow the presidency to fall into the hands of a non-Kikuyu. Though there were no arrests, officials privately linked the plot to unidentified <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON> aides and relatives who months before had tried unsuccessfully to thwart the constitutional transfer of power to <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> retained many of <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON>'s political allies, although some were his political enemies. It was only in September that he succeeded in ridding the party of the last vestiges of <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON>'s power clique In a week of party elections _ beginning with grassroots balloting and ending with selection of national officers _ <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> retained the party presidency, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s supreme political job, but the eight officers under him changed, cementing <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>'s power base. During his 15 years of rule after independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON> would wave a flywisk, his symbol of office, and lead cheering crowds in <LOCATION> Kiswahili </LOCATION> chants of `` Harambee'' -LRB- Let's pull together -RRB-. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>, saying he and the nation would be guided by the course <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON> had charted, adopted as his symbol of office and <PERSON> Poer </PERSON> a gold and ivory baton and proclaimed a new slogan: `` Nayo'' -LRB- FootstEp -RRB-. In his first days in office, <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> emptied the jails of political detainees, but began his own detentions after junior officers of the air force unsuccessfully tried to overthrow him on Aug. 1, 1982. Five people are now detained under a security law that allows the government to jail people indefinitely without trial. About 100 other people _ including journalists, lawyers, academics and civil servants _ have been jailed in the past 30 months after confessing links with several groups accused of plotting to overthrow <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>. The campaign against purported dissidents brought unaccustomed criticism of <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> from human rights groups and others who charged confessions were coerced and that civil liberties were being trampled. `` President <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> has presided over a steady deteroriation of the rule of law,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Styron </PERSON>, chairwoman of the judge's panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Award </ORGANIZATION>, said in September when announcing that the Kenyan lawyer and former political detainee <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamau </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuria </PERSON> was the 1988 winner. `` <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> today is a land where only the animals are truly free,'' she said. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> is popular with <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s masses and enjoys the reputaton with Western governments as a moderate. He has cordial ties with most of his African peers, but is cool to military rulers. He has made <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>'s best friend in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Western governments, in turn, hold <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> up to other African nations as an example, citing its robust capitalist economy and cooperation among the races. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> remains a mecca for tourists. It's able to feed itself, a rarity in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and is one of the few countries in the region not troubled with civil war. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s economy is one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s success stories, but has started to stagger under the burden of the world's fastest-growning population _ a nearly 4 percent pace that is expected to double the 22 million population by the beginning of the century. The population includes 300,000 non-blacks, most of them `` Asians,'' the collective name for people from the Indian subcontinent. There are about 60,000 `` Europeans,'' the name Africans assign to all whites. On the eve of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s independence in 1963 and despite his armed Mau-Mau revolt in 1952-56 against British rule, <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON> appealed to whites and other non-Africans to stay put and to help build black-led <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. Most did and many continue to prosper under <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>. Minorities, especially the Asians, still control a disproportionate amount of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s economy _ from groceries and clothing stores to major factories. But whites have no political clout. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, son of anthropologists <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, is the only non-black member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and serves as an assistant minister of tourism and wildlife. His brother, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, is director of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s museums. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>, 64 years old and divorced, is a private person. He does not give interviews. Most of his comments are gleaned from his frequent appearances at public rallies where he staunchly defends <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and his government. `` We are a sovereign state and can stand on our feet,'' he said recently in at attack on foreign critics. `` We are not under anyone's feet.'' The Kenyan press, one of the most sophisticated in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, is assailed by a chorus of protests, often led by <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>, when it publishes stories that are not to the government's liking. A church-run magazine, Beyond, was banned earlier this year after publishing an article alleging fraud during primary elections. Nowadays, clergymen and the Law Society of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> are the only public critics of government and even their protests are presented so as not to offend or even mention the head of state. `` We are conscious of a certain inadequacy of dialogue in the country,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> said in a letter to <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> in November 1986. `` At present, discussion is precluded by allegation of powerful party officials that any questioning of the system is tantamout to disloyalty,'' the bishops added. `` Already the party is assuming a totalitarian role.''

 Watching the new movie, `` Imagine: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>,'' was very painful for the late Beatle's wife, <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>. `` The only reason why I did watch it to the end is because I'm responsible for it, even though somebody else made it,'' she said Cassettes, film footage and other elements of the acclaimed movie were collected by <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>. She also took cassettes of interviews by <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, which were edited in such a way that he narrates the picture. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Solt </PERSON> -LRB- `` This Is Elvis'' -RRB- directed, <PERSON> Solt </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolper </PERSON> produced and <PERSON> Solt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> wrote it. `` I think this is really the definitive documentary of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s life,'' <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> said in an interview. `` What <PERSON> John </PERSON> was really about is depicted in this film, very accurately and without whitewashing. `` I did view it. I did n't have them take any footage out. `` I wanted the truth. In the sense you had to put a 40-year life into an hour and a half; balance is a very serious consideration. I think they did a remarkable job and very tastefully so.'' There is a soundtrack album and a coffeetable book with comments primarily by <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, tied in with the film and using the same title.

 `` Imagine'' is more than a Lennon elegy. Though it fails to delve too deeply into the darker side of <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> and the Beatles -LRB- drug use, abusive tempers, manager <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>'s death -RRB-, it does capture the music and the times in which <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> lived. One intriguing episode in `` Imagine'' shows cartoonist <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capp </PERSON> -LRB- `` L'il Abner'' -RRB- being antagonistic toward the <ORGANIZATION> Lennons </ORGANIZATION> during their bed-in, when they stayed in bed for a week to publicize their concern for peace. `` We were naive,'' <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> said. `` A lot of things happened because we were naive. Maybe that was our strength. To us, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capp </PERSON> was just a cartoonist and you naturally assume a cartoonist is liberal, with a sense of humor. We did n't expect hostility. `` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capp </PERSON> is one incident that was filmed. In those days we did numerous interviews because of our stand for world peace. ... There were some very rough interviews. The hostility that was shown to us bluntly by reporters in those days was incredible. Each time, I think we were hurt.'' <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> wrote the song `` Imagine'' in 1969 or'70. `` We did the bed-in, the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> Peace Festival, the ` War's Over' billboard He was saying we need an anthem for this whole concept of world peace. I think it's one of the songs that will really go on forever in people's minds.''

 <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> was born Oct. 9, 1940. He was shot and killed outside his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment on Dec. 8, 1980. <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> was a painter when <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> met her. She later joined him in music and in public demonstrations for peace. `` I think that for somebody like me, because I feel that I'm an artist and a creative artist, that it is a very strange turn of events that I'm known as a widow,'' she said. `` But it is stranger to me that I'm not that disturbed by it. I think that <PERSON> John </PERSON> promoted my work a lot in his lifetime and somehow it seems like it is a pleasure for me to sort of still work in a context of a partnership with him. ... I think it is my turn to promote him. He promoted me.'' When <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>'s `` The Lives of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'' was published in September, depicting the former Beatle as riddled with vices, faults and neuroses, <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> called it `` totally fiction.'' Since then she's received a tremendous amount of support from friends and fans. `` I was very touched and thankful that people sent letters to me and extended hands at this time, very warmly. I really appreciate that. I was also surprised that so many people stood up against it -LRB- the Goldman book -RRB-. I did n't expect that,'' <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s half sister, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, also has written a new book, `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, My Brother.'' She has no idea how many books have been written about <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>; she's been sent some of them but has n't read them `` I know the life and it is too painful to read somebody else's version.'' There's still enough footage, <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> said, for another movie _ perhaps a music or political or art film. And there's another big <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> project on her horizon. `` It's from unpublished songs which were written for a Broadway musical. I do n't know if it would have gotten to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. You aim for the stars, you know. The songs might be strung together. They might become a record, might eventually become a musical. There are enough finished songs. They were never recorded in the studio. They're on cassettes.'' Their son <PERSON> Sean </PERSON>, 13, like his older half-brother, <PERSON> Julian </PERSON>, has become interested in music and started playing guitar. `` I had reservations about <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> going into the music field. I still do. But I kind of gave up on it,'' <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> said. `` He is into guitar now. A session musician, a very good one, was teaching him. According to this teacher, it seems like he is very good. He is just totally involved in it, listening to <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Clapton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, his dad's songs _ only for guitar playing, I think. `` He is into it so much, good luck to him.''

 Building products giant <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, nearly brought to ruin in 1982 by billions of dollars in asbestos-related lawsuits, is a changed company on the verge of shedding its Chapter 11 protection. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection this past week of the last challenge to <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization plan virtually assures its emergence from `` the wind tunnel,'' as <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, chief executive officer, describes the company's six-year Chapter 11 odyssey. Without explanation, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> turned down the challenge by <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> company that for years distributed <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> asbestos products. <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> has 25 days to seek a second <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review, but has not indicated whether it will. If the company waives a second review, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> would have just 30 days of legal requirements before it could emerge from Chapter 11 reorganization. `` It's a day we've worked for for a long, long time,'' said <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, who has guided <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> through the last two years of reorganization. When <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> filed for Chapter 11 protection on Aug. 26, 1982, it was being deluged with asbestos injury and property-damage lawsuits at a rate of 400 a month. By 1986, property damage claims alone had come to a staggering $ 85 billion, or about 40 times the company's total assets. The company also faced more than 17,000 personal injury claims in the billions of dollars. The Chapter 11 filing allowed <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> to operate in an interest-free environment safe from the mounting injury and damage claims and to draft a more than $ 2.5 billion trust-fund plan to pay asbestos victims. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> approved <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization claims payment plan in December 1986, but challenges have delayed its implementation. Now, with the last hurdle nearly behind it, a refitted <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> is poised to begin operation free of court protection and supervision. The reorganization plan has been praised and pilloried. <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, a bankruptcy specialist with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Cowen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, described it as `` a work of art, a stunningly magnificent document.'' <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crary </PERSON>, a litigation analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simpson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment research firm, said <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> shareholders will be big losers. They will see their stake diluted, winding up with one share of new <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> stock for every eight shares they hold today. `` Basically, they wiped out their shareholders,'' said <PERSON> Crary </PERSON>. `` I'm disgusted with the way <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> conducted itself. It's been guilty of a gross abdication of fiduciary responsibility to shareholders.'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, however, said the plan protects shareholders while at the same time addressing the asbestos claims problem. `` To all those who said the filing was inappropriate, I think the $ 2.6 billion is testimony to the fact that <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> has dealt effectively with the problem,'' he said following the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> said the plan will help <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> remain a financially and operationally healthy company. `` Even assuming a mild recession, the recent cost-cutting measures that <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> has undertaken _ the elimination of low-profit or no-profit businesses and the acquisition of high-profit businesses _ will allow <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> significant cash flow and profitability in the future,'' he said. The reorganization plan calls for establishment of a Personal Injury Settlement Trust, to settle claims of asbestos health victims for the next 25 years. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> already has paid $ 150 million into the trust, and its insurers will pay another $ 615 million immediately. Beginning in 1991, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> will make annual payments to the trust of $ 75 million until 2012. A second trust, called the <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Damage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Settlement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, would settle asbestos-related property claims. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> is obligated to pay $ 100 million cash immediately to this trust, and the company's insurance carriers also will contribute millions of dollars. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> faces immediate cash obligations of $ 247.5 million to commercial creditors once it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling brings the plan closer to implementation for thousands of asbestos victims around the nation. `` I am praying that this is the end of the road for us,'' said <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Asbestos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Soquel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The group has more than 13,000 members across the country. While some analysts question whether the trust payments will drain the company's cash flow and profits over the next quarter century, others say the payments are arranged so that <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> may juggle its trust-payment obligations while continuing to expand. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION>, which made a $ 164 million profit on $ 2.06 billion in sales last year, today consists of three parts: a <ORGANIZATION> Fiber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which produces insulation products and glass fibers; a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, producing wood and paper products, and a <ORGANIZATION> Specialty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, making diverse goods ranging from commercial-industrial lighting to filter materials for the beer and wine industries. `` The fascinating part of the bankruptcy is that we've designed a $ 2 billion company from scratch,'' said <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. He said the reorganized <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> is a blend of mature businesses, such as fiberglass and forest products, and growth businesses, in its Specialty Products Group. `` To optimize the value for shareholders, what you like to do is have growth and maturity,'' he said. `` If you just have growth with no cash flow, then you tend to leverage. And then when things go bad, negative leverage will kill you. `` So, it's like a sonata. It's a carefully orchestrated balance.''

 No matter how good the statistics on the economy get these days, they do n't seem to be good enough to quell fears on Wall Street of an approaching recession. By most standards, the figures on the pace of business activity and growth have been very upbeat of late. The latest case in point: The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report Friday of a drop in the unemployment rate from 5.6 percent in August to 5.4 percent in September. While job growth continued, it occurred at a relatively subdued rate, which suggested that the economy was neither getting too hot nor catching a chill. Analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> probably would like the figures enough to decide against any further credit-tightening in its battle against inflation. Meanwhile, the passage of time has made it increasingly apparent that last year's stock market crash was not the immediate precursor of a corresponding plunge for the economy. The stock market has been holding its ground lately because of `` a total absence of any sign of a recession,'' in the words of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailliot </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counseling </ORGANIZATION>, a Pittsburgh-based money management firm. Yet Gailliot, like a good many other observers, believes the gains recorded by stock prices this year have represented nothing more than a `` bear market rally,'' and argues that a recession is likely by next year. `` If this business cycle is to move toward recession in the standard sequence, which involves capacity strains in finance, industrial output and employment, the recession will occur in 1989,'' he maintains. `` The overextended consumer will stop in a not very different fashion from the overextended stock market, which stopped in August of 1987.'' Not everyone shares this view, of course. For the nearly six years since the current period expansion began, the optimists have been right and the frequent warnings from the pessimists have proved wrong. `` We do not anticipate a recession soon,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McCamant </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION>, in the latest issue of that investment advisory publication. `` It is important to look at the economy sector by sector, rather than always concentrating on the aggregate numbers. `` During this long period of prosperity, we have had some serious recessions in a number of different industries. The oil supply industry is still in its recession. `` The ` Rust Belt' companies are now in the early stages of an economic recovery, helped by strong exports. In this sector the recovery is still very young and is far short of previous cyclical peaks.'' The optimistic camp got a lift late in the past week when the stock and bond markets responded enthusiastically to the employment report. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks closed Friday at 2,150.25, up 37.34 points from the week before and not far from the post-crash closing high of 2,158.61 it reached on July 5. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index rose 3.24 to 156.81, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index gained 2.19 to 303.82. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market, weighed down by selling in high-technology issues, dropped 2.04 to 385.67. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 166.65 million shares a day, against 134.94 million the week before. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, argues that forecasting a recession based on traditional economic-cycle reasoning is misguided because economic circumstances have changed. He says `` market capitalism'' and intense global competition now exert forces of discipline on the economy that, in effect, regulate activity much more effectively than government policymakers used to. `` Severe busts will no longer be necessary to unwind the excesses caused by booms,'' he contends. `` Excesses wo n't be allowed to build in the first place.''

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> should be freed of bureaucratic red tape and made an independent government corporation, similar to <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Transportation <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said regulation of aviation safety should remain in the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. But he told the <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> needs independence to `` do a much better job of modernizing air traffic control and keeping pace with growth.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AOPA </ORGANIZATION> represents private aircraft owners and pilots. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is a unique federal agency because it combines three distinct and somewhat contradictory missions,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is charged with establishing and enforcing aviation safety regulations, providing air traffic control service and encouraging development of civil aeronautics and air commerce. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said he wanted to retain control of aircraft safety because `` aviation will do much better in the annual budget battles with the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with a cabinet secretary as its spokesman.'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> also called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act on a `` tort liability crisis in general aviation manufacturing'' that has resulted in insurance costs rising fivefold since 1981, while sales have dropped from 17,000 planes in 1979 to 1,500 in 1986. `` While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> procrastinates on the resolution of this urgent issue, general aviation manufacturers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are poised to invade <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> also said: _ He was concerned by alcohol and drug abuse among pilots, noting that indictments were handed down in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, last week `` against some two dozen pilots for failing to disclose convictions for drug and alcohol related offenses on the Airman Medical Certificates they provided to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. _ Nationally, there is `` a dire need for airport expansion and improvement A major airport has not been constructed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> opened in the mid-70s,'' although he noted that <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, residents voted in May to permit <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to annex land for a new hub airport.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Prices Unable To Sustain Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil futures prices have wilted following a technical rally that failed to shake off market concerns about <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s threats to overproduce crude. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> rose 6 cents to settle at $ 12.66 a barrel on Thursday, but other contract months settled as much as 15 cents lower. The near-term contract had been up as much as 30 cents during the session. Among refined products traded on the exchange, the November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose .06 cent to settle at 39.50 cents a gallon, while home heating oil slipped 0.52 cent to 37.24 cents a gallon. Other contract months finished lower. Traders said a technical rally gripped the market, pushing prices higher by midday, but broke down shortly thereafter on a dearth of encouraging news. `` The market still looks sick,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said participants were continuing to focus on <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s production levels. Earlier this week <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest oil exporter, threatened not to restrain its own production if other members of the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cartel continued to pump beyond their quotas. `` That's old news, but it's still the focus of the market, and there's a feeling that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has not yet achieved its goals and will continue to pressure prices,'' <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> said. The Saudis have indicated they want to punish other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for overproducing and driving down the price of oil. Traders also remained concerned about a report that surfaced Wednesday that said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chartered a number of tankers to transport a substantial amount of oil out of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, presumably from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>.

Ms. <PERSON> Sack </PERSON> agreed, saying, `` We're not going to see the kind of pressure on their margins,'' as in recent quarters `` I think it's safe to say the worst is over for retailers,'' she said. The analysts said softness in retail sales was not necessarily a sign of weakness in consumer spending, which is watched closely as an economic indicator because it accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product. `` Consumers are spending at a very high rate _ they've just been moving to other areas like durables,'' said <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc.. Ms. <PERSON> Sack </PERSON> noted consumers also have been spending more for services _ such as utilities and medical care _ leaving them less money for general merchandise and Apparel sales, which have been in a year-long slump of their own, improved slightly last month, but analysts still described them as weak. Several retailers recorded sales increases of 3 percent or less _ meaning they continued to lose ground to inflation, which has run at an annual rate of 4.6 percent so far this year. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest retailer, said its overall sales rose 6.6 percent in September and 5.7 percent for the first 35 weeks of the fiscal year. Sales from <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stores open at least a year _ known in the trade as same-store or comparable sales _ were up 1.6 percent last month and 2 percent for the year to date. Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are a more accurate yardstick of a company's performance than figures which include sales from new stores. But not all retailers report both overall and same-store results. K mart <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 7.1 percent last month and 5.6 percent for the cumulative 35-week period. Same-store sales were up 3 percent for September and 2 percent for the year to date. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its sales were up 25 percent overall last month, while climbing 30 percent so far this year. Same-store sales, meanwhile, were up 10 percent in September and 11 percent for the year to date. <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 1.3 percent in September, and 1.7 percent for the year to date <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s same-store sales were up 0.7 percent for the month and 0.6 percent so far this year <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 15.1 percent last month, and 16.9 percent for the year to date. Same-store sales picked up 2.9 percent in September and 1.7 percent so far this year. May <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 21 percent in September while picking up 14.6 percent so far this year. Same-store sales were up 3 percent for the month and 1.6 percent for the year to date. F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its September sales rose 13.7 percent, while year-to-date sales rose 12.2 percent. Same-store sales rose 7.2 percent for the month and 5.9 percent for the first 35 weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its sales were up 3.5 percent in September and 3.1 percent so far this year. <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer, said its overall sales rose 11 percent last month and 6 percent for the year to date. Limited's same-store sales were up 7 percent in September _ an improvement over the company's performance in recent months _ while falling 1 percent over the cumulative 35-week period. Apparel sales began slumping in August 1987, when many women turned away from shorter skirts and fashions they considered boring. The results reported Thursday were from general merchandise and apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released by the federal government, they do not include sales at auto dealers, supermarkets or restaurants.

 <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> struck out the first time it tried to manufacture personal computers, so in its second venture into the market it is relying on a specialist. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will make personal computers to <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s specifications, which <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> will market and sell under its brand, <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> group manager for strategic relations, said Thursday `` The personal computer market has moved more and more into a commodity orientation. Digital does n't feel that we -LRB- should be -RRB- using our resources to try and compete in manufacturing that kind of product,'' <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said. `` So we cut out and made an agreement with a company which is.'' The agreement comes two days after <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> announced its first licensing agreement ever to allow an outside firm to manufacture its computers. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Allen-Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> announced an alliance designed to strengthen <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s hold in the manufacturing automation market `` It's desirable for DEC to be able to provide the complete computing needs to any major customer from the personal level to the super-minicomputer level,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, an analyst and managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Most analysts would agree that <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION> is making the right decision in augmenting their product line through outside suppliers,'' <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> missed the boat with its first attempt at a personal computer line five or six years ago. `` DEC had a major false start in personal computers when they introduced a number of products, including a product called Rainbow -LRB- and -RRB- ... they did n't meet with a great deal of success,'' <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> said. `` For one reason or another the personal computer was not their focus at that time.'' <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said the arrangement with <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> was in response to customer demand. `` Digital has been asked to provide support for a range of different vendors and we have concluded agreements with several of those companies to provide full service and support,'' he said. Digital agreed to service and certify certain <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> personal computers to operate in Digital networks. Company officials refused to describe the computers in detail. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Burran </PERSON>, the marketing manager for <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s personal computer group, said the new machines would differ from <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>'s own line in extra features that will make them fit easily into <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s networking system. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamagata </PERSON> said he was not able to reveal a product line. `` We're their manufacturing source. We will work to develop the computers to their specifications,'' he said. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Monosson </PERSON>, an independent analyst who has followed <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> for 20 years, said <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> has created systems in the past to interface with software from other companies. But he said this was <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s first marketing agreement with another company. `` I wonder how Apple, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> are going to feel about this new arrangement,'' <PERSON> Monosson </PERSON> said. `` This is the first product that they are offering to distribute through their sales operation.''

<HEAD>Renew Steel Import Quotas, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new study provides ammunition for companies that want the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to extend soon-to-expire steel import quotas with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other nations, according to one steel-state senator. The study, released Thursday by three <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorneys and economist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Noellert </PERSON>, says conditions that led to negotiation of steel import barriers by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1984 _ namely, intervention by foreign governments to help their steelmakers compete in world markets _ have not changed. The study will help steel makers convince the public the five-year quotas, which expire in the fall of 1989, should be continued, said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public will have the facts about the extent to which foreign governments have rigged the world's steel supply, and about the failure of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to do anything about it until the eleventh hour,'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said Noellert and attorneys <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wm </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> all work for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> firm of <LOCATION> Dewey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ballantine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bushby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. Their research was financed partly by six <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> steel companies that are on record as favoring continuation of the quotas. In conjunction with the release of the study, those six companies released their own statement on import ceilings during a press conference Thursday. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not dismantle this system until the international distortions which give rise to the policy in the first place have been eliminated,'' said the statement by <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Congressional pressure and a finding by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that the steel industry was being harmed by imports led the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to negotiate five-year import agreements with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and other leading steel exporters in 1984 The agreements placed product-by-product caps on the amount of steel than can be imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year. Since the quotas took effect, the foreign share of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> steel market has dropped from 26.4 percent in 1984 to 21.3 percent in 1987, according to Thursday's study, called `` Steel and the State.'' The steel industry, which cut its workforce from 500,000 in 1973 to 163,000 in 1987, was profitable last year for the first time since 1981. Given continuing government subsidies of foreign steel operations, the study said it would be `` imprudent, if not foolhardy, to permit completely open access to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market ...'' The study said that even with the quotas, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has permitted a much higher level of steel imports than <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would consider acceptable.

<HEAD>Kroger Axes 300 Workers In Anti-Takeover Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has announced a round of layoffs under a $ 4.6 billion restructuring aimed at thwarting an unwanted takeover, with 300 corporate headquarters workers from vice presidents to secretaries getting their walking papers. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday that the firings of 300 of its 800 corporate employees would enable it to save $ 13 million a year and defend the company from takeover attempts. The workers were told only hours earlier that they would be let go, although rumors of mass layoffs had circulated all week. All were covered by severance packages that provided up to nine months' pay, plus insurance and other benefits, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said `` They're not finished yet,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, who still has his job in the management information systems department. `` It's like watching a horror film and knowing it's coming, but you do n't know when `` Seeing your friends go is the hardest part. There are a lot of depressed people right now,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillenbrand </PERSON>, who was fired from her job in the transportation department. `` It was not a surprise.'' As part of the restructuring, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> also plans to pay shareholders a special $ 48 a share dividend _ $ 40 in cash and a bond it values at $ 8. The supermarket company also has plans to sell certain businesses in order to help cut costs and streamline operations. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> last month proposed the restructuring to fend off unwanted takeover offers from <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm, and the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family, which controls retailer <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlbeg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday raised its offer to $ 5.03 billion, or $ 64 a share in cash and securities, and proposed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> whether or not it restructured <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> had not responded publicly to <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s offer by late Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which last month began the bidding competition for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, stated Wednesday it was interested in working with <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> to enhance the restructuring by providing more equity _ a statement some analysts interpreted as an offer of assistance to help <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> fend off <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>. The Hafts, of <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, opened the <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> bidding Sept. 19 with an unsolicited offer of $ 55 per share, or $ 4.32 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> have not increased their offer.

<TEXT>
 The European Economic Community will not oppose <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s request for a special international trade panel to resolve their dispute over the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> anti-dumping policy, an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said Friday. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the spokeswoman said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> was confident its policy conformed with international trade rules. `` We are utterly serene'' about the formation of the panel, said the official. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has contended that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s imposition of anti-dumping duties on locally-assembled Japanese electronic typewriters and other products violates international trade rules. Specifically, the Japanese government believes that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is violating a rule of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that requires locally based foreign manufacturers to be treated in the same manner as their domestic counterparts. A decision to form the panel likely will be made at a meeting on Oct. 19 of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> council, the international trade body, the spokeswoman said. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> rejected a complaint by a number of Japanese companies that the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> used faulty accounting methods in anti-dumping cases.

 The stock market rallied today on news of smaller-than-expected employment growth last month. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.27 to 2,120.02 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 3 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 682 up, 234 down and 452 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 25.91 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Before the opening the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 percent in September from 5.6 percent the month before. But at the same time the agency said nonfarm payroll employment grew by 255,000 jobs, a bit less than the consensus estimate on Wall Street. The employment growth figure for August was revised downward. Wall Street took the news as an indication that a widely discussed resurgence of strong economic growth might not be taking place, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in a position to hold off on any further tightening of credit. Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government bonds rose by nearly $ 10 for each $ 1,000 in face value, putting their yields as low as 8.85 percent. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -LRB- to 115 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> -LCB- to 74 |; <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> -RCB- to 56 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> 1 \ to 98 The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained .67 to 154.60.

But he joined an attorney for the Soviets in arguing that the case should not be tried in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts. <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, businessman, sued the Soviets after they revoked his license to do business in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where he had been selling medical equipment for 14 years. He was expelled and branded a spy in an article in the official Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. His attorney, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>, told a panel of the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in the one-day hearing that <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> deserves a trial. However, Letter argued: `` We have been working very closely with the Soviets and we have made wonderful progress. It's important that this progress not be set back. `` It is our position that under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, you can not sue a foreign entity for libel,'' Letter said. `` And even if you can, you ca n't do it on the facts of this case.'' <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> ridiculed Letter's contention that the fate of U.S.-Soviet relations depends on Gregorian. `` I personally think they have bigger people to fry than my client,'' he told the court. Reached by telephone, <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> expressed amazement at the statements about his role in international affairs. `` If being fair to me affects our relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, then we do n't have any relations,'' he said. `` The question is why have they -LRB- the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government -RRB- turned against me? I'm really too small a guy ... We're talking about two superpowers. This is infantile, sophomoric and unfair.'' One of the appellate judges, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON>, bristled at the mention of foreign relations, saying, `` Is n't that something we're supposed to ignore _ the political considerations _ in reaching our decision? <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mage </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney representing the Soviets, insisted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts do not have jurisdiction because the incidents in question did not occur in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He also said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is immune from a lawsuit as a foreign sovereign. <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> argued that the Soviets libeled <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> in connection with a commercial enterprise and that such an action is exempt from the immunities act. <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>'s problems date back to 1984 when the Soviets said he could no longer sell medical equipment such as kidney dialysis and heart-lung machines. The Soviet newspaper then printed a story denouncing <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> as a `` duplicitous negotiator,'' accusing him of bribery and smuggling and intimating that he was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy. <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>, adamant about his innocence, sued for libel and demanded payment for medical equipment still in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Soviets dispute his contention that he still has equipment there. The Soviet defendants ignored the suit until 1985, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> entered a default judgment against them, awarding Gregorian total damages of $ 413,000. Of that amount, $ 250,000 was for libel. The Soviets refused to pay. <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> said he would seize Soviet assets and even took custody of a typewriter at an <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> correspondent's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> home as partial payment. The Soviets and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> went to court and asserted immunity from suit under the immunities act. Last year <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> reversed his own libel judgment, ruling that he did not have jurisdiction because of immunity considerations. But he let stand his ruling the Soviets should pay for the medical supplies. <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> appealed the libel ruling to the 9th Circuit. The Soviets appealed the contractual award as well as disputing the libel claim.

 Civilian unemployment fell 0.2 percentage point to 5.4 percent last month as payrolls grew by 255,000 jobs, 100,000 of them in education with the opening of the fall school term, the government said today. The decline erased an August gain and returned joblessness to July's level. With only one more jobless rate to come before the Nov. 8 election, economists said they did not expect the reports for September and October to help Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The October jobless figures will be reported only four days before the election. Across private industry, the job gain was just 142,000. It was the second straight month of little expansion after average monthly increases of 300,000 over the first seven months of 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Assembly-line manufacturing jobs fell by 19,000 atop a loss of 18,000 jobs in August. That reversed an upward trend that had persisted for 1 -LCB- years. Oil and gas industry employment also fell for the second month in a row after edging up gradually across the previous 12 months. Together, those industries had averaged a monthly job gain of 65,000 from January through July. Adult men accounted for nearly all of the decline in the overall rate last month, with joblessness falling from 4.9 percent in August to 4.5 percent last month. Except for Hispanics, whose rate fell from 8.4 percent to 7.4 percent, there was little change among the various population groups tracked. The September figures show that the number of unemployed Americans fell by 255,000 to 6.6 million. The number of `` discouraged workers,'' those who have given up the hunt for a job in the belief that they could not find one, rose from 910,000 to 930,000 in the third quarter of 1988. More than half of the discouraged workers were women and one-third were blacks. `` Monthly increases in total payroll employment have slowed in the third quarter, averaging only a little more than 200,000 per month compared with 340,000 in the first half of the year,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, the commissioner of labor statistics, in congressional testimony. Excluding teachers and other government workers, health services was the biggest source of new jobs last month, with such payrolls growing by 62,000. In contrast, the government said, business services, one of the strongest job sources across the six-year expansion, showed little growth. Wholesale trade added 25,000 jobs in September, continuing a pattern of consistent growth brought about largely through rising exports caused by the fallen value of the dollar. On the eve of today's report, economists said they had expected the rate to decline last month. `` Even if the unemployment rate went up, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would not get any help because the financial markets would react positively,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a private consulting house. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm based in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, predicted that employment, inflation and trade figures between now and the election all will paint a rosy economy. `` He's not going to get any help from the raw employment figures,'' <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` If he's going to win on economics, it's going to have to come from convincing people there's a problem ahead of us.'' Vice President and Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly focused on the creation of some 15 million new jobs under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration since the end of the 1981-82 recession, which had sent the jobless rate into double digits. Making much the same point, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters this morning: `` We talk about the record 70 months of economic expansion but these figures tell the real story that people can understand. They mean paychecks, school clothes and families that can plan a brighter future. `` That's what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stand for and that's what the administration has worked for in the last eight years. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has countered that the issue is not the number of new jobs being created, but the quality of those jobs, saying hourly wages after adjustments for inflation have fallen since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> assumed office in 1981. August figures on inflation and average wages bolstered that argument. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that real hourly earnings in terms of purchasing power dropped 1.3 percent during the month, the worst decline since the government began collecting figures on them in 1964. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today that average hourly wages rose 0.5 percentage point last month to $ 9.37 after declining by two cents an hour from May through August. <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said private surveys show wages beginning to accelerate, `` but very, very slowly'' at an annual rate of between 3.5 percent to 4 percent. `` There have be some large increases for entry-level jobs, but they have not spread throughout the society,'' he said. `` Large companies, in particular, have been successful in resisting them.'' An alternate jobless rate, including the 1.7 million members of the armed forces stationed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, also fell 0.2 percentage point last month _ to 5.3 percent.

 Talks about <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s possible sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary to rival <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bring together two former bitter adversaries. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> apparently has put Eastern on the auction block, just a few months after Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> vowed to shareholders that the ailing unit was not for sale. Sources said Thursday that takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, was talking with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> about acquiring Miami-based Eastern That report came a day after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> confirmed he was negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> about a possible purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s air shuttle operation and said a contract could be signed by next week. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was in contact Thursday with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, exploring ways in which the two might buy separate pieces of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, according to a report in today's editions of the Wall Street Journal. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> `` wants to divest himself of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> one way or another,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, an airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> reportedly would pay more than $ 300 million cash for the shuttle, which serves <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and is <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s most profitable operation. Some analysts said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> might use the shuttle to help draw people to his hotel and casino properties in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. Airline analysts suggested <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> might be willing to acquire all of Eastern except the shuttle. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> are wily and tenacious executives who dueled over control of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> three years ago. A lot has changed since then, for both men and for the deregulated airline business. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> empire went on to acquire Eastern for $ 676 million after his <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> bid failed, apparently has decided that running an unwieldy and fractious airline company is too much trouble. Eastern has been fraught with labor agitation and staggering financial losses before and since <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> took over. Eastern lost $ 120 million in the first half of the year and recently laid off about 3,000 union employees. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> also owns Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a non-union carrier that recently has started to stem its losses. For <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who has chased giant companies ranging from <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in recent years, the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would make <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline in terms of revenue passenger miles, an industry measurement of capacity. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is said to be interested in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s north-south routes, especially between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, as possible feeders into <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s trans-Atlantic routes. Eastern's Latin American and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> routes also reportedly piqued <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s interest. Eastern's militant workers, who characterize <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> as a union buster, have been included in talks with <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> on the possible sale of the airline to him, sources familiar with the situation said. Such a situation recalls the move by <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s workers in 1985 to talk with <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> about possibly buying that airline, which <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was seeking in order to strengthen the operations of his other carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. At that time, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and machinists promised <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> hundreds of millions of dollars in labor concessions if he took control, largely because they feared <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> would gut <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and replace them with lower-paid workers, a strategy <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> had used earlier at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. Now, the Eastern unions favor a sale of the entire airline as a going concern to a friendly acquirer, while they are opposed to the sale of individual assets such as the shuttle. At a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> shareholders meeting in early June, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said `` <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is not for sale.'' He said a study estimated Eastern's net-asset value at more than $ 2 billion, or nearly $ 50 for each <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> share. But financial analysts have put <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s value at closer to $ 500 million. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> might be willing to pay more if <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions agreed to labor concessions as part of the deal, analysts and union sources said. Since the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> takeover, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has faced his own labor problems, beginning with a bitter strike by flight attendants in 1986. The strike failed, but the flight attendants union has continued challenging <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. It petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportion </ORGANIZATION> to review his fitness to run the airline earlier this year. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> also has incurred the wrath of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots, who claim he broke promises to them when he initially acquired control of the airline. The pilots have sued him on grounds he is borrowing against the airline's properties without making crucial long-term investments in equipment. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has denied the charges of both unions.

 The stock market gained ground today on news of smaller-than-expected employment growth last month. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.38 to 2,119.13 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 756 up, 406 down and 521 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 52.79 million shares at midmorning. Before the opening the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 percent in September from 5.6 percent the month before. But at the same time the agency said nonfarm payroll employment grew by 255,000 jobs, a bit less than the consensus estimate on Wall Street. The employment growth figure for August was revised downward. Wall Street took the news as an indication that a widely discussed resurgence of strong economic growth might not be taking place, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in a position to hold off on any further tightening of credit. Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government bonds rose by nearly $ 10 for each $ 1,000 in face value, putting their yields as low as 8.85 percent.

 While <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has not rejected <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5.2 billion takeover offer, it has become increasingly hostile toward the British company, warning shareholders not to be fooled by its `` blitz campaign.'' In his first major public response to the unsolicited $ 60-a-share bid launched Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Grand </PERSON> <PERSON> Met </PERSON> was trying to `` stampede'' shareholders and others into believing the offer was `` good for all our constituents.'' `` We should not accept Grand Met's words at face value,'' he said Thursday. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also told <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> employees to treat the British food and liquor conglomerate with skepticism when it claims that a successful takeover would not result in major job cuts. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said late Thursday that a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state judge had upheld a restraining order barring Grand Metropolitan from buying any <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> stock because of questions over whether a buyout would violate liquor laws in a number of states. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and two other <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> officials met privately late in the day with Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> at the Capitol to brief the governor on the takeover `` in terms of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s perspective,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>'s communications director, confirmed today. <PERSON> Bohn </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> officials requested the meeting and spent between 30 and 45 minutes with the governor. `` They know that, in terms of legislative prerogatives, there's not much that can be done because they're a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> corporation,'' <PERSON> Bohn </PERSON> said He said the <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> officials asked the governor to check whether Grand Metropolitan may be violating an old state law prohibiting companies which produce or distill liquor from owning retail liquor outlets such as <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s Steak and Ale restaurants. <PERSON> Bohn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> agreed to check with the attorney general's office and with state Public Safety Commissioner <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tschida </PERSON> and expects to have a response within a few days The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, in its editions today, quoted <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> as saying Thursday, `` We're not going to be taken over'' by Grand Metropolitan. The newspaper said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> made the comment to the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> `` after a hastily arranged meeting'' with <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> made his remarks in a letter to employees of the Minneapolis-based food and restaurant business. The letter also was distributed to the news media. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors is studying the $ 5.23 billion buyout offer to shareholders and will make a recommendation `` in due course,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Haeg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> has not discussed the takeover bid with Grand Met, a major wine and spirits maker which also owns hotels, betting offices in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alpo </PERSON> pet food and Pearle vision centers. Grand Met officials have indicated they would not engage in wholesale job reductions at <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, but `` Grand Met's history is filled with just the opposite kind of corporate behavior,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said in his letter, which did not cite examples. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, a spokesman for Grand Met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, disputed <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s remark about job reductions. `` The letter is what it is,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. `` It has a purpose. You figure it out.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also disputed assertions by security analysts, Grand Met and some newspapers that <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> has few choices in dealing with the takeover bid. `` ... They have no idea what programs I've been working on to add value to this company,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` But I think there are significant opportunities to improve the value.'' Some analysts have said <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> shareholders might have a hard time rejecting the all-cash offer. Before Grand Met offered $ 60 a share, the stock was trading in the range of $ 39. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed down 25 cents to $ 57.87 -LCB- Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> court ruling stemmed from <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to block Grand met by suing the company in 14 states on the grounds a takeover would violate `` tied-house'' statutes prohibiting liquor manufacturers from owning retail liquor outlets. The decision by Judge <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeim </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> marked the second time that such a restraining order has withstood a challenge by Grand Met, said <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Of the 14 lawsuits filed, seven have resulted in restraining orders against Grand Met, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Grand Met wants an exemption from the statutes, saying it would sell the <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s retail liquor outlets if it bought the company. Grand Met also announced Thursday that it had lined up an additional $ 2.25 billion in financing for the proposed buyout. Combined with $ 3.75 billion in financing already in place, the revolving line of credit supplied by six European banks gives Grand Met $ 6 billion in available funds, <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said.

 Grain and soybean futures prices dipped in early trading today at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, pressured by expectations of bearish crop production reports and good harvesting weather. Updated estimates on grain and soybean harvest yields to be released by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> next Wednesday are expected to show larger amounts than previous figures, and that led traders to sell, analysts said. Dry weather forecast for much of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> over the weekend was expected to allow active harvesting in both corn and soybeans, which helped keep the lid on prices. In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2 -RCB- cents lower, with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.30 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 -RCB- cents lower, with December at $ 2.96 \ a bushel; oats were 3 \ cents lower to -LCB- cent higher, with December at $ 2.44 a bushel; and soybeans were 4 -RCB- cents lower to 2 \ cents higher, with November at $ 8.08 Cattle and hog futures prices opened mixed at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In early trading, live cattle were .12 cent to .32 cent lower, with the contract for delivery in October at 72.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .32 cent higher, with October at 81.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .28 cent lower to .20 cent higher, with October at 40.05 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .0 cent to .65 cent lower, with February at 8.60 cents a pound. Cattle prices were mostly higher, hog prices were mostly lower and pork bellies declined in trading Thursday.

<HEAD>Chinese Government to Clamp Down on Capital Investment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chinese officials have announced tough new measures to halt construction projects targeted in an upcoming nationwide crackdown on what the government considers excessive capital investment, which officials blame for high inflation. After Dec. 1, authorities will withhold bank loans, energy and building supplies and construction licenses from targeted projects to force them to close down, the official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. The newspaper quoted senior official <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Guangjian </PERSON>, newly appointed by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> to spearhead efforts to curb capital construction. He said projects slated for cancellation include those that rely on imported or scarce domestic raw materials, are underfinanced, will produce high-energy-consuming goods or goods that are already made in excess. Aside from a handful of projects already approved by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, construction will be halted on all office buildings, auditoriums and hotels begun this year. No new building will be allowed for two to three years, he said. According to a <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> report, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said projects which use imported technology and foreign funding are expected to escape cutting. Capital investment has grown at a rate of 18.8 percent over the past three years, far outstripping the 16.4 percent rate of increase in national income during the same period. The too-rapid rate of investment has helped fuel an inflation rate currently about 20 percent. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said blind emphasis on short-term profits in enterprises as well as the failure of local banks to abide by state loan quotas and policies were responsible for `` investment inflation.'' The Central Committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> launched an attack on inflation and confusion in the economy in its plenary session last week, criticizing party members and local officials for lax discipline in carrying out its economic policies. The central government has led repeated drives with little success against excessive capital investment, including a partial halt on hotel and theater construction earlier this year. Leaders intend the current campaign to be all-inclusive in scope, subjecting all capital investment nationwide to close scrutiny.

<HEAD>Corn, Hog Markets Keep Watchful Eye On Aflatoxin Spread</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers across the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> are examining their corn while traders keep a watchful eye on the market as the discovery of a cancer-causing toxic mold _ a by-product of this summer's drought _ threatens to curb an already reduced crop. Early indications are that aflatoxin, though found already in several states, will not pose a serious problem, experts say. But concerns that the progressing harvest will reveal the mold is widespread have lent support to corn prices at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, analysts say. And aflatoxin is in the back of the minds of traders at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where prices of hogs _ a major corn consumer and especially vulnerable to the toxin _ would feel the effects of an outbreak. `` One thought is that it's going to reduce the corn supply,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a livestock analyst and president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` The other concern is that if the contamination becomes too widespread it will hurt our exports _ countries would not want to buy'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn out of fear of contamination. `` So it could have a bullish or bearish impact,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. But with only about one-third of the nation's corn crop in the bin, it's too soon to tell, he said. The toxin is a metabolic by-product of the fungus Aspergillus flavus, which primarily affects corn and peanut crops, said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, a plant pathologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. The fungus appears on corn kernels in hot, dry weather and thrives in conditions like this past summer's drought, followed by the wet fall. Ordinarily, the fungus can only be detected through a series of tests. But on a severely affected ear of corn, it shows up as an olive-green colored mold, visible to the naked eye, he said. After tainted corn is harvested, the fungus will spread in storage unless the crop is kept cool and dry, <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said. Neither heat treatment nor fungicides destroy the toxin. Animals generally begin showing symptoms such as loss of appetite and weight if fed corn tainted with about 200 to 300 parts per billion for a period of two months or more, <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said. In extremely large doses, the toxin can cause liver cancer in humans. But it is `` highly unlikely'' that humans will be affected by the outbreak, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>, an animal sciences professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. This year _ like the last aflatoxin outbreak in 1983, another drought year _ the toxin has been discovered in corn crops throughout the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. A statewide survey in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> of 327 corn samples has found 35.8 percent contained toxin levels of above 20 parts per billion, the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> said. Under <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> guidelines, corn destined for humans or dairy cattle must contain less than 20 parts per billion of the toxin. Corn for breeding cattle or swine must contain below 100 parts per billion. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> this past week revised its standards for corn shipped interstate, allowing up to 100 parts per billion if the feed is given only to mature animals. The Board of Trade recently announced that `` no corn could be delivered on our contracts that contained more than the 20 parts-per-billion limit from the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> guidelines,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Prout </PERSON>. Despite the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> revision, `` Our limit stays the same, to assure the users of our markets of the quality of the grain being traded,'' <PERSON> Prout </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> officials estimate that 10 percent to 14 percent of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> corn contains some amounts of the toxin. Milk containing unacceptable levels of aflatoxin has been traced to several <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> dairies. The toxin has appeared in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, and testing is being done in those states as well as in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` If we find out that a lot of the corn is affected and is toxic ... it will affect our costs of production down the road,'' said livestock analyst <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We're not feeding a lot of the new crop corn yet, we're still feeding a lot of the old crop corn. But if it really cuts into the availabilty of corn supplies next year ... it could stimulate some liquidation of hogs,'' <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. The near-term effect would likely be a decline in hog futures prices, but the long-term impact of a diminished corn supply would be bullish. `` Tight corn supplies will eventually lead to tighter meat supplies, you can bet your bottom dollar,'' <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. Since the 1983 drought, rapid screening tests have been devised that can detect the toxin in minutes, <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said. At grain elevators, inspectors first put corn samples under an ultra-violet light. If kernels glow, the fungus is present, and a rapid antibody-antigen test is then performed to determine presence and amount of toxin. `` The elevators tell me they're turning away about 5 to 10 percent average corn for having more than 20 parts per billion,'' <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said. `` If I were a farmer,'' he said, `` I would be sampling my grain, purchasing a rapid-screening test kit ... I would screen my grain and I would also be sure that I was storing my grain at a low-moisture level'' at lower than 70 degrees. `` I would definitely be concerned,'' <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said, `` but not be overly concerned. It's a management problem that can be dealt with.''

 The stock market put together a brisk rally today on news of smaller-than-expected employment growth last month. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 31.47 to 2,139.22 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 5 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 998 up, 407 down and 487 unchanged. Before the opening the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 percent in September from 5.6 percent the month before. But at the same time the agency said nonfarm payroll employment grew by 255,000 jobs, a bit less than the consensus estimate on Wall Street. The employment growth figure for August was revised downward. Wall Street took the news as an indication that a widely discussed resurgence of strong economic growth might not be taking place, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in a position to hold off on any further tightening of credit.

<HEAD>Chinese Delegation Learns Management At Geneva Steel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OREM, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 43-member Chinese delegation came away from its tour of <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> this week so impressed that members said they intend to borrow some of the management ideas they found at the central <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> plant. `` I think we have already learned valuable management practices,'' said <PERSON> Cai </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Liaoning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Provincial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metallurgical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are some steel factories in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> whose production is not good. We are very interested in how to effectively manage factories.'' The delegation, made up of steel industry and government officials from the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, were in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> for management and operational training at <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>. The group plans to spend two months in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to take a closer look at American steel operations. On Saturday, the delegation was scheduled to fly to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> _ originally built during World War II to supplement military steel production _ was of special interest to the Chinese. `` <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> has a unique distinction of being an older integrated steel mill that is continually upgraded with new technology,'' <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said. `` The Chinese have a similar situation with older steel plants and older manufacturing that they need to upgrade rather than replace. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said the Chinese are interested in learning how to stay competitive without investing in brand new technology. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shihuan </PERSON>, senior engineer and vice chief of the works at <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> Iron and Steel Works in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> plant is similar to those in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We have learned more here about how to use modernization in the controls of a plant, which allows a plant that is relatively old with out-of-date equipment to be very productive,'' he explained. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> operates a steel plant in the southwest region of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with 7,000 employees who produce 300,000 tons of steel a year. All steel plants in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are government-owned. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> stands to benefit from the visit as well. `` Exporting to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is certainly another possible outcome in this interaction. In some regions there is a deficit of the steel industry,'' <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Hua-Yang Technology and <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is the delegation's sponsoring agency host from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>

 <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s radio flagship for 62 years and once home to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> conducted by <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Toscanini </PERSON>, goes off the air today as a result of a corporate takeover. The new owner is changing the talk and music station, a clear-channel spot on the dial at 660 that can be heard in 35 states at night, to an all-sports format. The station's forerunner was a pioneer with a string of firsts including such things as the first broadcast of a World Series and the first broadcast of the national political conventions. It also had the first broadcast commercial. <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION>'s signoff, announced Feb. 18, is the result of a $ 6 billion deal in 1985 in which <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulation prevents a new owner from keeping both a television and a radio station in the same market. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> decided to sell its new radio properties and keep the more profitable <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. GE sold the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> radio network to Westwood One for $ 55 million and sold five stations to <ORGANIZATION> Emmis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 121.5 million. One station is still up for sale, <ORGANIZATION> KNBR </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> signs off at 5:30 p.m. today and turns into <ORGANIZATION> WFAN </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Emmis </ORGANIZATION>' sports format station, previously heard at 1050 on the dial <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION>'s frequency, 660, is more desirable from an engineering standpoint The change means about 50 <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> employees are out of jobs. The station went on the air in April 1922 as W2XY, then owned by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T. It became <ORGANIZATION> WBAY </ORGANIZATION> in July that year and changed to <ORGANIZATION> WEAF </ORGANIZATION> in August. RCA bought the station from <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T for $ 1 million in 1926 when it formed <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> to help sell the radios it was building. But the call letters were n't changed to <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> until 1946. `` The format has changed, the personalities have changed, the call letters have changed, change is inevitable,'' said <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> program director <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, one of those losing a job. <ORGANIZATION> WEAF </ORGANIZATION> had the first World Series broadcast, <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> vs. Giants, in 1923; the first coast-to-coast hookup in 1924; and the first broadcast of the national political conventions in 1924. In 1925, it broadcast a presidential inaugural address _ by <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> _ for the first time. The first radio commercial was aired on <ORGANIZATION> WEAF </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 28, 1922, when a real estate developer from across the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> paid $ 100 for a 10-minute announcement to advertise apartments. `` Up to that point radio was for experimenters and people were still thinking of ways to make money with it,'' <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> said.

The merger will nearly double <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s size, vaulting it close to the top 10 of the nation's largest banking companies. The two had a combined $ 47.8 billion in assets as of June 30. The board vote Friday came two days after Irving Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> announced he would abandon his year-long resistance to the proposed acquisition and drop all pending lawsuits and anti-takeover defenses aimed at stopping Bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> also promised to move up his retirement plans and leave after the deal was completed. In return, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> sweetened its previous hostile offer by about $ 200 million by slightly increasing the stock portion of the bid and adding stock warrants. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> has a tender offer, scheduled to expire Oct. 21, under way for <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> shares. As of Sept. 30, nearly 10.46 million of Irving's 18.9 million outstanding shares had been tendered to <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Neither side has commented publicly on the turn of events leading to the tentative pact. But banking analysts agreed <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> was forced to negotiate in the absence of any `` white knight'' takeover partner and after an appeals court invalidated <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s anti-takeover `` poison pill'' defense The Appellate Division of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday struck down a provision allowing all <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> shareholders _ except a hostile suitor _ to buy $ 400 worth of Irving shares for $ 200 if any suitor bought more than 20 percent of Irving stock without <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> management support. Such devices are intended to make unsolicited takeover bids prohibitively expensive. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> had vowed to appeal the ruling to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals. But some legal experts questioned whether that court would have considered the case since the Appellate Division's decision was unanimous. Last spring, Milan-based <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, offered to merge with <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> as part of a major restructuring of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank. But it recently withdrew the bid after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> ruled the Italian government agency that owned most of <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> had to supply separate financial imformation. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> already has given conditional approval for an Irving-Bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> merger. Under its revised bid, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 4.9 percent of <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, would pay $ 15 in cash and 1.675 shares of its own stock for each of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s common shares outstanding. It also included warrants valued at $ 5 toward the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> stock. The entire deal was worth about $ 78.42 a share, or about $ 1.48 billion, according to <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> figures. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> stock was trading at $ 74.75 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Friday afternoon, up $ 1.12 -LCB- from late Thursday. All present directors of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> would be invited to join <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors under the proposed plan, and all key personnel decisions would be made by a committee of directors made up of three directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and two current <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> directors. When <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> first made its bid on Sept. 25, 1987, it had the distinction of being the first-ever hostile takeover fight between two big American banks. It then became the lengthiest such battle among major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations.

 Soybean futures prices plunged Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, pressured by a lack of export business and expections of higher government crop estimates. The negative sentiment spilled over into the corn pit, sparking a selling wave that kept prices down, analysts said.

Anticipation that updated <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> estimates to be released next Wednesday will show higher soybean harvest yields helped trigger the sell-off in beans, he said. Good harvesting weather forecast for the weekend also added a negative tone to corn and soybean prices, analysts said. At the close, wheat was unchanged to 2 \ cents higher, with the contract for delivery in December $ 4.35; corn was 1 cent to 3 -RCB- cents lower, with December at $ 2.94 \ a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 3 cents lower, with December at $ 2.43 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent to 23 -RCB- cents lower, with November at $ 7.89 a

 News of slower-than-expected employment growth last month provided the spark for a rally in the stock market today. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 36.10 to 2,143.85 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 5 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,037 up, 426 down and 456 unchanged. Before the opening the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 percent in September from 5.6 percent the month before. But at the same time the agency said nonfarm payroll employment grew by 255,000 jobs, a bit less than the consensus estimate on Wall Street. The employment growth figure for August was revised downward. Wall Street took the news as an indication that a widely discussed resurgence of strong economic growth might not be taking place, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in a position to hold off on any further tightening of credit. Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government bonds rose by about $ 10 for each $ 1,000 in face value, putting their yields as low as 8.85 percent. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 | to 115 |; <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> 1 -LRB- to 47 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> | to 40 -LRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> ~ to 43 <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> dropped 1 | to 25 in heavy over-the-counter trading, registering disappointment among investors over the size of the third-quarter earnings gain reported by the company Also, <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> said it was anticipating a slight decline in profits for the fourth quarter from the July-September period.

 <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON> is busy dodging swarms of forklifts around Snokist Growers' apple warehouses. The company president is trying to stay out of the way of 1,400 employees who clean, sort, pack and ship up to 1 million apples per day as the nation's largest apple crop moves into peak harvest. `` The receiving crews are working from 6 in the morning to 9 at night,'' <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON> said this week. `` We had 50,000 cartons packed last week.'' The forklifts are moving 700-pound bins of Red Delicious apples from trucks to sorting lines, or stacking them 11 high in refrigerated warehouses. And so it will go at 300 warehouses across central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the next month as crews move 5.7 billion apples, handpicked by over 40,000 farmworkers, from a crop the industry hopes is a major improvement over 1987. Plagued by a record production, poor quality, weather damage, falling prices, and a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> boycott, the 1987 apple crop was a major disaster for the state's 4,500 growers. Although the 68 million boxes of supermarket apples were 13 million above the previous state record, prices remained below the cost of production nearly the entire year. As a result, the $ 312.4 million growers received for apples was $ 177 million less than the year before. Things were so bad that Snokist, a cooperative with 380 member growers, failed to pay a dividend for only the second time in its 80-year history, <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON> said. The first time was in 1985 when frost wiped out 60 percent of the crop. This year's harvest is projected at only 57.2 million boxes, and quality is looking much better, growers say. `` This crop is a vintage crop,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, an industry trade group. `` It's remarkably good in color, size and inner quality.'' `` There is awfully high confidence this year,'' he said. Part of that optimism is based on national estimates of a crop of just 111 million boxes, 22 million boxes less than last year. That should keep prices up for apples, which trail only potatoes and lettuce in national produce sales. Early market prices of $ 14 to $ 16 per 42-pound box are well above the $ 9.50 per box growers need to break even. Last year, prices dropped as low as $ 5 per box. Although 35 states grow apples commercially, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> produces about half the nation's supermarket apples each year, and accounts for over 80 percent of apple exports. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> ranked second last year with 9.2 million boxes, followed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with 9 million and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with 5.4 million boxes, the commission said. Exports were one of the few bright spots for the 1987 crop, setting a record despite the spring boycott by the EEC. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> growers blamed the boycott on the desire of the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments to protect their local growers from competition. The boycott has been lifted now. This year the industry is taking steps to ensure that consumers will get a crisper apple. For the first time, the industry has instituted a firmness standard that is designed to ensure that top grade apples stay crisp at least two weeks after they are shipped to supermarkets. Apples too soft to meet that requirement will be diverted to juice and applesauce processors. St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said the firmness standard, adopted this summer by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, can not guarantee proper handling by supermarkets, but is designed to ensure a better shelf life for the fruit. `` We lose control once we slam the door on the trucks,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> IC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday filed a registration statement with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> required for the spinoff of the Illinois Central Railroad. The parent company said it expects to distribute approximately 21 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> common stock to shareholders by the end of the year, after a favorable ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> last week. Under the proposed plan, <ORGANIZATION> IC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> shareholders willl receive one share of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> common stock for each five shares of <ORGANIZATION> IC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> common stock they hold. Application is being made to have the new <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> common stock listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, IC said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> IC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> had earlier obtained a ruling from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that the stock dividend will be tax-free to its shareholders. Before the distribution, <ORGANIZATION> IC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> will contribute to the railroad $ 180 million in cash and forgiveness of net advances, plus $ 25 million in real estate.

<TEXT>
 They all hail from <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, and their egos are king-sized. Corporate raider <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, airline cost-slasher <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and glitzy real estate mogul <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> speak the language of the working-class <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> borough. They have made millions from their brash mega-deals. They live in luxury. Now each is keenly interested in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The similarities are startling, but their unyielding tycoon styles raise the question of whether this ego trio ultimately can agree on a way to divvy up financially troubled Eastern, part of <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is believed to be looking to sell parts or all of Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fraught with labor conflict and staggering losses before and since he took over `` The question is whether there's a -LRB- negotiating -RRB- table big enough to get all three around,'' chuckled one Wall Street investment banker who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` It's very difficult to do any three-party deal, and when you have the likes of those three, it increases the degree of difficulty exponentially.'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has met with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> in the past to discuss the possibility of buying some Eastern assets. But he re-emerged this week, reportedly interested in acquiring all of Eastern except for its lucrative shuttle service. Enter <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, hotel and casino fame. He has his eye on the shuttle, which serves <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Despite the trading floor jokes, one Wall Street source noted that `` what you've got is three very sharp deal people, and there's a feeling they can probably come up with something very creative if they want to achieve the end result. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has retained the quick reflexes of his trader days. In typical raider fashion, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> buys into companies whose assets are worth more than their stock price, and then makes money selling the companies later _ whole or in pieces _ unless the companies offer to buy him out at a premium. His target list ranges from <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The only deterrent, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has said, is a company's stock price, a most telling `` report card.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate and medical school dropout, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> resides in a verdant <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suburb and has designed the gardens that skirt his mansion. But he is said to be more intensely interested in business than in indulging in the pleasures of wealth. Posing beside him in a photograph that appeared in Business Week magazine recently was a majestic German shepherd. But his interest in animals does n't stop there. Within his business empire are partnerships that bear the names <ORGANIZATION> Gnu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wolf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> man. His parents emigrated from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and ran a hairdressing salon in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, but their business, he once said, was hit hard by the advent of the do-it-at-home permanent wave. His goal has been to run businesses that are as lean as his distance-runner's frame. He shocked the industry in 1983 by filing to reorganize <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> under federal bankruptcy laws, firing all 12,000 employees in the process. He hired back only 4,000 at tremendous wage cuts. Often projecting a cold, tough-guy persona, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> threatened several times to have beefy security guards eject shareholders from the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> annual meeting in June because they continued their questioning after he had asked them to refrain. Beaming proudly this week when <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> announced a $ 50 million deal with <ORGANIZATION> Scandinavian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> was his neatly coiffed mother, who often attends his business functions. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, a product of military school and the <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, followed in his father's footsteps when he embarked upon a career as a developer. But he made his bailiwick <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, rather than the less tony outer boroughs. Success came before he was even 30, and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was eager to accumulate the riches his money could provide. He seems driven to have his name emblazoned on high-profile properties like skyscrapers, million-dollar condos, casinos and helicopters. In the 1970s he offered to build a $ 170 million convention center for the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> if his father's name could appear on it. The city declined. Among his recent purchases is the Plaza Hotel, a French Renaissance landmark adjacent to Central Park, which he purchased for about $ 400 million. The 808-room hotel is being run by his Czech-born wife, <PERSON> Ivana </PERSON>, for `` $ 1 a year and all the dresses she can buy.'' Under her tutelage, employees have been instructed to regularly stamp the sand in the hotel's ashtrays with the Plaza logo.

 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, seeking to restore order to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s pricing system, is increasing pressure on overproducing cartel members by stepping up its own oil output _ and industry analysts predict the tactic will work. The strategy _ which has forced the price of oil dramatically lower _ will enable the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> and other members of the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to stake out positions prior to key meetings expected to be held this month and next, the analysts said. `` The lower prices get, the better it is,'' said <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` It will force -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations -RRB- to realize they have to take some kind of definite action.'' <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzian </PERSON>, editor of the Paris-based oil publication Petrostrategies, agreed. `` The way things are being done is excellent,'' he said. `` Unless there is enough pressure on ... the market, the cheaters in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will never learn their lesson.'' World oil prices have plunged recently amid reports of burgeoning supplies and persistent discord in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. Prices have been running more than $ 5 a barrel below the cartel's benchmark of $ 18 for a 42-gallon barrel. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading Friday, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, closed at $ 12.94 a 42-gallon barrel, up 28 cents from Thursday. Oil prices took a steep dive early in the week after <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest oil exporter, warned it will continue producing more than its OPEC-set limit unless other cartel members stick to their quotas. Analysts estimated <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has recently pumped some 5.7 million barrels a day, topping its 4.3 million-barrel quota. `` It's an attempt by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to crack the whip,'' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Antill </PERSON>, an oil analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION>. Added <PERSON> Terzian </PERSON>, `` If the Saudis continue the pressure on the market, that's the only way an agreement can be reached.'' <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> warned recently prices could plummet to $ 5 a barrel if the Saudis exploited their production capacity to force other cartel members to observe their quotas. The bickering in the cartel precedes a joint meeting of two <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> committees. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has not yet announced the date or place, but analysts say Oct. 20 is likely, possibly in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. The talks will bring officials of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to their first <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting since an August cease-fire in their nearly 8-year-old war. With the former enemies at the bargaining table, the officials will likely discuss ways to shape a pact on production limits that will bring <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> back into the quota system and discourage cheating among other members. Both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> want to export more oil to pay for enormous projects needed to rebuild their war-damaged economies. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> refused to go along with its quota of 1.5 million barrels a day during the war and demanded a share equal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 2.4 million. But analysts said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been pumping well above that level, averaging about 2.7 million barrels a day, and could reach 3.7 million by mid-1989 with completion of a new pipeline through <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to the Red Sea. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s output has been estimated at less than 2 million barrels a day. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> also has exceeded its ceiling of 948,000 barrels. Oil minister <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> has set the limit at 1.5 million barrels. Analysts said the upcoming discussions will lay the groundwork for a meeting of all 13 oil ministers scheduled to begin Nov. 21 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Antill </PERSON> suggested the oil producers might settle on a production package that would set a cartel ceiling of about 18.5 million barrels a day. The current level is a bit more than 15 million barrels, without <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> estimated in its Monthly Oil Market Report that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production, including <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, soared to 20 million barrels a day in September, up from 19.8 million in August. Under <PERSON> Antill </PERSON>'s scenario, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> each would be assigned a quota of 2.7 million barrels a day and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> would be given several hundred thousand barrels a day more. Ms. <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said the ministers also may consider lowering their benchmark price from $ 18 a barrel to $ 15. The current target, she said, `` is completely impossible.'' But <PERSON> Terzian </PERSON> noted the desire of both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for more money and argued that keeping a fairly high target would help <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> write a new production accord.

<HEAD>Bond Market Cheered by September Employment Report</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 First Fridays are proving to be full of mostly pleasant surprises for the bond market. But some analysts see turbulence ahead. For the past two months, the first Friday has meant reassurance for bondholders worried that the economy may be growing so fast that inflation will accelerate and take a heavy toll on the value of their fixed-income securities. The first Friday of each month is when the government reports on the employment situation in the previous month, providing the most current official glimpse of the state of the economy. The reports for August and September have indicated to many analysts that the economy is growing at a moderate yet still healthy pace. More important, each of the reports was viewed as reducing chances that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would feel compelled to encourage higher interest rates. This past Friday, the government reported that the September unemployment rate slipped to 5.4 percent from 5.6 percent the previous month. Most bond traders focused on payroll employment growth, though, and the September increase of 255,000 jobs fell 45,000 short of expectations. The reaction was immediate. Prices jumped and trading volume swelled after slowing to a trickle in the past few days in anticipation of the report. By midafternoon, the price of the 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond was up more than $ 15 for every $ 1,000 in face value and its yield was at 8.80 percent, its lowest level since mid-April. The rally was not quite as strong as the one that followed the release of the August unemployment figures, which saw the unemployment rate rise to 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent in July and payroll growth of 219,000. Bonds staged one of their biggest advances of the year that day, with some 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues rising more than $ 25 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Some analysts said the latest report confirmed the conclusion suggested by the unemployment report a month ago that the economy was moderating. `` It belied the notion that the August figures were an aberration,'' said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, fixed-income research director for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` It appears they were the beginning of a new moderate growth trend for the economy.'' But other analysts said economy continues to grow at a fairly strong pace and warned that higher interest rates may lie ahead. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Santow </PERSON>, managing director for <ORGANIZATION> Griggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial consulting firm, said, `` The market was so fearful of huge increases that the number was greeted with a sigh of relief.'' He said the market's sharp rise Friday may also have reflected a delayed response to sharp declines in oil prices earlier in the week. Crude oil prices plunged below $ 13 a barrel to two-year lows at midweek, a plus for the inflation outlook, but the bond market barely moved as traders refused to budge before the unemployment report. On the other hand, some economists said the market may have ignored in its euphoria the wage data released with the unemployment report. It said, for instance, that real hourly earnings dropped 1.3 percent during the month while average hourly wages rose 0.5 percentage point. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of money market research for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the wage measurements `` provide a modest hint that there could be some pickup in wage inflation.'' Can the bond market extend Friday's advance? <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Wood, money market economist for <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, noted that the big rally following the August unemployment report lasted only a day. `` It would n't surprise me to see the same kind of reaction this go around,'' he said, noting that the market runs into some important producer price and trade balance reports due to be released in the coming week.

 The stock market rose sharply today, inspired by news of smaller-than-expected employment growth last month. Before the opening the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 percent in September from 5.6 percent the month before. But at the same time the agency said nonfarm payroll employment grew by 255,000 jobs, a bit less than the consensus estimate on Wall Street. The employment growth figure for August was revised downward. Wall Street took the news as an indication that a widely discussed resurgence of strong economic growth might not be taking place, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in a position to hold off on any further tightening of credit. Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government bonds rose by about $ 15 for each $ 1,000 in face value, putting their yields as low as 8.8 percent.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Reinstates USA Antitrust Suit Against ARCO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 USA Petroleum can sue the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly conspiring with retail service stations to fix prices at below-market levels, a federal court ruled Friday. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed a district court ruling that dismissed <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'s lawsuit because the independent gasoline marketer failed to prove `` antitrust injury.'' In its lawsuit, <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> said more than a dozen large independent gasoline companies have sold out, liquidated or drastically curtailed operations and many independent retail stations have closed as a result of <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> price-fixing that involved discontinuing credit cards and offering lower gas prices. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, a direct competitor of <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> at the retail level, also said that it has suffered financial losses because of the price-fixing and is being driven out of the market as a result. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> contended <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'s alleged harm was not an antitrust injury because it resulted only from non-predatory, verticle price competition. But the appeals court disagreed. `` In the present case, plaintiff's injuries result directly from pricing practices that defendants admit -LRB- for the purpose of this appeal -RRB- are forbidden by the antitrust laws and are therefore illegal,'' the circuit court said in its 2-1 decision. The court rejected <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>'s argument that <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'s injuries resulted from increased rather than decreased competition. `` The removal of some elements of price competition distorts the markets and harms all the participants: those retailers which have lost their ability to set prices, the other retailers in the same market who are harmed by the distorted market, and the consumers,'' said the decision written by Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON>. `` Even if we were to analyze the question at the more specific level of maximum resale price fixing, given the longterm consequences of that practice we would reach the same result for similar reasons,'' the opinion said. Judge <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON> dissented and said <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> failed to show it was hurt by antitrust practices. He said the essence of <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'s claim is that `` one of the major oil companies, <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>, intruded upon the independent retailers' market niche by under-pricing the independent retailers The result is lower prices to consumers, but less profit for <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON> concluded that the majority decision `` ignores the fact that consumers are not injured by maximum vertical price-fixing, and retail competitors are not injured and can not complain about minimum verticle price fixing.''

<HEAD>Chemical May Vanish From Dow Company Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chemical may be its middle name, but <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is thinking of dropping the word to reflect the increasing breadth of its business, a company official said Friday. A consultant and a small study group at Dow are reviewing the idea, but have reached no conclusions, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, manager of public communications. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said if there is a change, it will be to show that <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION>'s business has expanded beyond basic chemicals to include products as diverse as insulation and household goods, such as food wrap and bathroom cleaner. The move would follow a trend of several years at <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, chemical industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Their strategy over the last seven years has been focused on diversifying out of commodity chemicals,'' to help lure investors wary of the cyclical nature of the basic chemical industry, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` They want to show that they are not cyclical, they're diversified,'' she said Dow sales comprise about 55 percent basic chemicals and 45 percent specialty goods such as its Styrofoam building insulation and its household products, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. Chemical is part of the name, but to describe the business, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said, `` The word does n't do anybody much good these days. We are trying to tell the public that we are more than just a chemical company.'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said no recommendations have been made to top management. `` If we make a change it's going to be months and months away,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is fighting back from its losses in the retail market with innovations ranging from in-store post offices to `` McKids'' clothing, in hopes of catching up with nimble specialty merchandisers. `` There are all sorts of things that are being offered to <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that are exciting and fun and desirable, and so <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> is trying to get in that ball game,'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s J.L. <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. `` I certainly see them trying to climb away from the all-things-to-all-people retailing situation they've been in for a long time,'' the marketing professor said. But <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said he believes `` <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> is coming in too little, too late. I do feel that they are in reasonably serious trouble.'' `` As someone once said, it's very very difficult to turn a battleship around in a stream,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> on Friday launched a test of post offices within stores at 10 Chicago-area sites and one in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> in a cooperative project with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> also for the first time in its history has opened a handful of in-store appliance and home electronics outlets known as Brand Central, which offer brand-name goods along with <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' privshare, from $ 81 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier Third-quarter revenue increased to $ 785 million from $ 501 million. `` We have been growing at an extraordinary pace over the past two years, due in large part to the widespread use of our microprocessors in the personal computer market,'' <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grove </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Kroger Rejects KKR's Buyout Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday rejected two buyout proposals by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and reaffirmed its intent to go ahead with a $ 4.6 billion corporate restructuring plan. The realignment prompted the firing of 300 headquarters employees announced Thursday. The supermarket giant said its board of directors unanimously rejected both of the latest unsolicited proposals made by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> City-based <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> in an Oct. 4 letter to <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Pachman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> had no comment on <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s response. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s more lucrative buyout offer of $ 5.03 billion, or $ 64-per-share, represented a sweetened offer from a $ 58.50-per-share pitch <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> made after entering the bidding last month. <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, started the bidding Sept. 19 with a $ 4.32 billion, $ 55-per-share offer. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> has not made another buyout offer. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON> said the board again decided that <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring is preferable to selling the company because it gives shareholders immediate cash dividends along with equity in a continuing company, although it would be smaller and more highly leveraged. As envisioned, the restructuring would leave <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> independent and publicly owned. `` Our program will permit shareholders to realize substantial immediate values on their common stock, while retaining the controlling equity interest in a company with a bright future,'' <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> shareholders have filed at least four lawsuits challenging management's decision not to sell <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>' latest proposals included the $ 5.03 billion buyout offer and a separate proposal to buy <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> even after it completes the restructuring. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has said its restructuring would require the layoffs announced Thursday and selling some real estate, supermarkets and convenience stores, as well as distribution and food-processing centers. `` <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s board concluded that both these latest <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> proposals were inadequate and not in the best interests of the company, its shareholders and other constituents,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` In making its determination, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s board considered various factors, including the opinion of the company's financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, that both <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> proposals are inadequate.'' The Kroger board said it also was concerned about possible regulatory antitrust problems and whether <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> could obtain the necessary financing. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> owns other food retailing companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday's mass firing, which gives employees up to nine months' salary and other benefits for up to a year, will save the company at least $ 13 million annually The firing does not affect supermarket employees. Some analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s staff reductions which leave 500 employees at it headquarters, still is n't likely to discourage takeover-minded outsiders. `` This is throwing bleeding hunks of meat over the bow of the boat, hoping the shark will slow down,'' said <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>, senior associate editor of Grocery Marketing, a trade publication. `` The shark wants a whole dinner, not just an appetizer.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Price Plunge Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices plunged for the second consecutive day Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, pressured by a lack of export business, expectations of higher government crop estimates and good harvesting weather. In other markets, wheat prices rallied, corn prices dipped, cocoa prices surged, oil prices advanced, gold declined, silver prices were higher, cattle and hog prices were mixed, and frozen pork bellies were sharply lower, Anticipation that updated <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> estimates to be released next Wednesday will show higher soybean harvest yields helped trigger the sell-off in beans, said analyst <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The November contract fell 22 -RCB- cents and settled at $ 7.90 a bushel, the lowest level since late July. The negative sentiment spilled over into the corn pit, sparking a selling wave that kept prices down, analysts said. Wheat prices rallied on ongoing expectations that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> plan big purchases, Good harvesting weather forecast for the weekend also added a negative tone to corn and soybean prices, analysts said. Wheat settled unchanged to 1 -RCB- cents higher, with December at $ 4.34 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 4 cents lower, with December at $ 2.94 \ a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 3 -LCB- cents lower, with December at $ 2.44 \ a bushel; and soybeans were 7 cents to 22 -RCB- cents lower, with November at $ 7.90 a Cocoa prices advanced at the Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>'s announcement that it will not cut the price it pays cocoa farmers. The news Thursday from the world's largest cocoa producer indicates that the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> likely will try to `` keep prices very highly valued into the season,'' said analyst <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Cocoa prices settled $ 18 to $ 39 higher, with the contract for delivery in December at $ 1,278 a ton. The rally in oil prices after a week-long slide was due mostly to technical factors, as traders squared their positions before the weekend, analysts said. But overproduction, which has sparked strong declines in recent days, remained the underlying influence on the market, they said. Crude oil was 25 cents to 28 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in November at $ 12.94 a barrel; heating oil was .22 cent to .57 cent higher, with November at 37.46 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .21 cent to .80 cent higher, with November at 40.13 cents a gallon. Trading was quiet in the gold and silver pits at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where stronger oil prices and a softer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar encouraged some buying. But gains were offset by strong treasury bond prices, analysts said. Gold prices settled 60 cents to $ 1.80 lower, with the October contract at $ 403.20 a troy ounce; silver was 2.5 cents to 3.7 cents higher, with October at $ 6.325 a troy ounce. Light boxed-beef sales kept the lid on live cattle prices at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, while cheaper corn prices buoyed feeder cattle prices, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Pork belly prices were down on mostly technical factors, and the negative sentiment spilled over into the hog pit, he said Live cattled settled .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher, with the contract for delivery in October at 72.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .55 cent higher, with October at 82.30 cents a pound; live hogs were .25 cent lower to .43 cent higher, with October at 40.45 cents a pound; and pork bellies were 1.35 cents to 1.70 cents lower, with February at 47.52 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls On U.S. Unemployment Report; Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar closed narrowly lower Friday after it skidded and then regained some ground in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s release of September unemployment figures. Gold prices were little changed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid of $ 403.30 for a troy ounce of gold, down 20 cents from late Thursday's $ 403.50. Analysts said the dollar fell after the government report, which included news that the nation's non-farm payroll grew by 255,000 jobs last month. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the unemployment rate fell 0.2 percent to 5.4 percent. Foreign exchange traders had expected a payroll increase of about 300,000, so the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s numbers came as a disappointment. Investors interpreted the payroll figures as a sign of weakness in the economy. But after further consideration, they `` realized the economy is growing steadily,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Frick </PERSON>, foreign exchange economist at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In addition, dollar traders seeing the stock and bond markets improve on the unemployment data were heartened by the demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments, said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, chief dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. As a result, the dollar regained some of the ground it lost earlier. Dealers expected Monday's Columbus Day bank holiday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and a holiday in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to produce quiet trading early next week. The dollar faces another test next Thursday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issues its report on the nation's trade deficit for August. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ended before the unemployment report came out, the dollar edged up to 133.50 Japanese yen Friday from 133.30 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 133.55 yen, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it slipped to 133.37 yen from late Thursday's 133.645 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar slipped against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6985 to buy one pound, more costly than $ 1.6935 late Thursday. Sterling also gained in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where it was quoted at $ 1.69795, compared with late Thursday's $ 1.6927.

<HEAD>Consumer Borrowing Up Sharply in August</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans took out consumer credit at an annual rate of 10.1 percent in August, up substantially from the July borrowing pace, the government reported Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said consumers took out $ 5.44 billion more in credit than they paid off in August, as auto loans and credit card debt grew more rapidly. Consumer debt had risen $ 3.62 billion in July, a 6.7 percent annual rate, as the pace of borrowing slowed momentarily following several months of rapid gains. In August, auto loans grew by $ 2.29 billion, a 9.7 percent rate of increase, following a 4.7 percent pace in July. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Penzer </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said the August increase was somewhat higher than many economists had been looking for and in part represented a reaction to the sluggish July increase. <PERSON> Penzer </PERSON> noted that consumer debt has risen by 9 percent in the last 12 months while personal incomes have gone up by 7.5 percent annual rate, indicating that Americans were still willing to take debt at a faster pace than their incomes were rising. `` Even though a lot of private economists are looking for consumers to moderate their spending, this report does n't suggest they are doing that,'' he said. `` Anybody looking for a slowdown in the economy in the second half of the year wo n't find it in these numbers.'' The Federal Reserve began a series of credit-tightening steps in late March in an effort to dampen demand and cool off inflationary pressures. Many analysts believe the central bank will resume pushing interest rates higher after the Nov. 8 election. The category that includes credit card debt rose by $ 2.62 billion in August, a hefty 18 percent annual rate of gain, following a sizable $ 2.12 billion rise in July. Together, the gains in auto and credit card debt accounted for 90 percent of the overall rise in consumer borrowing. The category that includes bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by $ 498 million, a 3.6 percent rate of increase, while loans for mobile homes rose $ 30 million, a 1.4 percent annual rate. The various changes left total consumer debt at $ 653.43 billion, up 9.2 percent from a year earlier.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise on Job Figures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices surged Friday, bolstered by a government report showing a smaller-than-expected rise in payroll employment in September. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond jumped about 1 11-16 points, or $ 16.87 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price and is an indicator of interest rate trends, tumbled to 8.79 percent from 8.94 percent late Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the September unemployment rate fell 0.2 percentage point to 5.4 percent. But the bond market was more intent on a companion report that said payrolls grew by 255,000 jobs, slightly below the 300,000 that many analysts had expected. The figures were considered fresh evidence of moderation in the economy. `` Basically, they were good for the market,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, a money-market economist at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said the report touched off a buying wave that was `` sort of like a snowball effect.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, money-market economist for <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the data provided `` further evidence that the economy is slowing down from the robust pace of expansion in the first half of the year.'' Payroll employment had been growing at a pace of about 340,000 a month in the first six months of the year, but that has slowed to an average of just over 200,000 in each of the past three months. A slower economy means credit demands may abate somewhat, easing upward pressure on interest rates. It also would reduce inflationary pressures, which erode bond values. In the secondary market, prices of short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues rose to between 9-32 point and 9-16 point, intermediate maturities advanced between 11-16 point and a full point, and 20-year issues gained 1 3-16 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point equals a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> composite Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, jumped 7.92 to 1,155.53. In corporate trading, prices also advanced. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 2.28 to 295.54. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, meanwhile, declined to 7.51 percent and the discount slipped 3 basis points to 7.28 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.83 percent and the discount fell 8 basis points to 7.44 percent. Yields on one-year bills dropped to 8.00 percent and the discount tumbled 12 basis points to 7.46 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 3-16 percent, down from 8 5-16 percent late Thursday.

 An outboard-motor manufacturer has agreed to finance a $ 20 million cleanup of PCBs in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, effectively ending years of bitter haggling over the Superfund site, state and federal officials announced Friday. Under a consent decree signed by <ORGANIZATION> Outboard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and federal and state officials, thousands of pounds of toxic polychlorinated biphenyls will be removed, treated and safely stored, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said. `` This is a major environmental victory,'' <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said, noting that no taxpayer dollars will be used in the clean-up. `` I think it's a sensational day.'' <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, an important <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> port at <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION>, 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, has been listed on the federal Superfund list of environmental hazards and at one time was considered Illinois' worst pollution problem. Public health officials have advised against eating fish from the harbor. PCBs have been shown to cause tumors in laboratory animals and are suspected to cause cancer in humans. `` We obviously believe that it's time to get this matter resolved,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Laurin </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in a telephone interview from <ORGANIZATION> OMC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION> headquarters. While acknowledging it is `` hard to be happy over spending $ 20 million in company assets,'' he said the decree `` is the best settlement possible.'' Contamination of the harbor began in 1961, when hydraulic fluid containing PCBs leaked from the hydraulic systems at the company's <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION> plant into waste waters, which were dumped into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and onto Outboard Marine property The case became entangled in the legal system as company officials first argued PCBs posed no threat to humans, then barred from their facilities federal environmental officials seeking to determine how bad the pollution was, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrecone </PERSON>. After 1986 changes in federal Superfund law allowed the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> such access, the company agreed to negotiate with state and federal authorities, <PERSON> Perrecone </PERSON> said. Under terms of Friday's consent decree, <ORGANIZATION> Outboard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> will begin cleaning up the PCBs next spring and should complete the task by 1992. The company will remove and treat contaminated material from both the harbor and its property. `` The agreement called for us to remove and treat sediments and soils that have the highest levels of contamination and encapsulate the remaining low-level soils and sediments in three areas,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Outboard Marine is a $ 1.3 billion manufacturer of recreational marine products and other recreational materials.

 <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> paid the state nearly $ 172.3 million Friday to settle most of the legal battle over the amount the oil company owes in state income taxes for 1978 through 1981, the state Revenue Department announced. Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> and the department resolved 14 major issues in the case, department spokesman <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> said in a news release. The issues involve the amount of taxable income from the production of oil and natural gas from <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION>, allowable tax deductions for exploration, development and operation of the oil and gas fields, and disagreement over the company's pipeline income, <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> and the state agreed to pursue litigation of two remaining issues involving a potential tax liability of $ 57.3 million, <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> said. Those issues involve the amount of interest the company can deduct in computing taxable income as an owner of the <ORGANIZATION> TransAlaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, and a dispute over how federal entitlement regulations are to be applied under the state's oil and gas corporate income tax, <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 profits will not be affected by the settlement because the company's financial reserves are sufficient to cover the issues in dispute, the news release said. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> was briefed on terms of the settlement and approved it, <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the settlement avoided a costly and protracted legal fight. `` The agreement reached with the state of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> is a reasonable resolution of complex and difficult issues,'' <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaible </PERSON> said the state decided to pursue litigation on the other issues because they involve legal precedents that will affect the entire petroleum industry. `` To the extent the remaining litigation falls in the test-case category, this settlement today marks the end of a long tax dispute,'' she said. `` This settlement reflects a reasonble assessment of what we would have recovered and serves the best interests of the state.'' State Revenue Commissioner <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> termed the settlement `` just and fair.''

 Stock prices rose sharply Friday to some of their highest levels since last year's crash, inspired by news of smaller-than-expected employment growth last month. The pace of trading picked up as the market climbed. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 42.50 points to 2,150.25, falling just short of the 1988 closing high of 2,158.61 it reached on July 5. For the week, the average rose 37.34 points. Some other, broader measures of market trends surpassed their July peaks _ for example, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks, which was up 2.88 at 156.81. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 3 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,140 up, 399 down and 420 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 216.35 million shares, against 153.57 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 248.31 million shares. Before the opening the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 percent in September from 5.6 percent the month before. But at the same time the agency said nonfarm payroll employment grew by 255,000 jobs, a bit less than the consensus estimate on Wall Street. The employment growth figure for August was revised downward. Wall Street took the news as an indication that a widely discussed resurgence of strong economic growth might not be taking place, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in a position to hold off on any further tightening of credit. `` These data are not unambiguously strong or weak, and do not provide a concrete case either way for a change in <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenbaum </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON>, who was told by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> he illegally sentenced a <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> bottling company to prison for price fixing, refused Friday to reconsider his sentence. In a six-page opinion, <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> said he derived his sentence against <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` from the basic principle that, to the extent possible, the law treats all persons _ whether natural or corporate _ equally. `` Any other treatment would belie that basic principle and create a special class of persons which this Court is unwilling to foster,'' he wrote. In a Sept. 30 letter, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> to reconsider his novel sentence because prosecutors would be unable to defend the sentence on appeal. Last month, <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Allegheny </PERSON> to three years in prison and fined the company $ 1 million for fixing its soft drink prices in collusion with <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The scheme cost customers in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> more than $ 10 million. <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> warned attorneys and executives of the <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> bottler that the corporation was treated as an individual under the law, and he would not hesitate to have federal marshals shut down the plant. He then suspended the sentence and $ 50,000 of the fine on the condition that the company provide four high-ranking executives to perform one year each of full-time, free community service in each of the three cities victimized. <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> said a $ 1 million fine, the maximum penalty for antitrust violations, was no deterrent since the scheme netted the company more than $ 10 million. `` It's just considered a cost of doing business,'' he said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney who prosecuted the case, agreed with <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON>'s reasoning, but said in his letter the <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> antitrust law allows only the imprisonment of executives, not corporations. `` We are not persuaded that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended to authorize courts to imprison corporations,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> wrote. `` Indeed, imprisoning a corporation by having a marshal seize its assets or otherwise limit its operations could adversely affect competition and further injure consumers.''

<HEAD>Shippers Say Drought Pulled Plug On Great Lakes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Freight companies hauling iron ore, coal and other heavy cargo through the Great Lakes say the summer drought pulled the plug on their shipping season by lowering water levels. But a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday the firms should n't blame the hot weather for failing to keep up with heavy demands. The Cleveland-based <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> will ask the corps to give them an extra month to haul cargo through locks at <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> Ste. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. The four locks _ which link <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and the industry-lined <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaway </LOCATION> _ normally close from Dec. 15 until April 1, when ice clogs the lakes. Shipping giants such as <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steamship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> say evaporation from the drought lowered water levels, forcing ships to lighten their cargoes. They want to use the <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> Ste. Marie locks until at least Jan. 15, <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nekvasil </PERSON> said Friday. The extension would give <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steamship </ORGANIZATION> and the group's 13 other shipping firms time to make extra trips and catch up with an increasing demand for raw materials, <PERSON> Nekvasil </PERSON> said. `` Fleets have been hard pressed to meet current demand,'' he said, adding that increased steel production has boosted 1988 shipments by more than 13 percent. Freight companies may need more time to keep pace with shipments, but they should n't blame the drought for their problems, corps spokesman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Billmaier </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think they hurt much from the drought. I just think they've got more business,'' said <PERSON> Billmaier </PERSON>, chief of operations and maintenance for the corps' <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> district. <PERSON> Billmaier </PERSON> confirmed that water levels have dropped over the past year, but said shipping companies compensated earlier by hauling heavier loads when the water was deeper. `` They ca n't haul loads as big as they could two years ago, that's true,'' he said. `` Maybe they ca n't make as much money. But they can still work the lakes.'' <PERSON> Billmaier </PERSON> said the corps, which controls the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> locks, also restricts winter shipping in an effort to minimize environmental damage. Ships maneuvering through ice jams cause extra water turbulence that kills fish, damages docks and shoreline and disturbs the bottom of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Billmaier </PERSON> said the corps' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> bureau probably will agree to extend the shipping season by at least two weeks if carriers can prove they need the extra time. He could not predict when a final ruling will be made.

 <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' second-largest bank-holding company and the last of the state's major banks to avoid seeking outside help, said Friday it is seeking a federal bailout in its proposed recapitalization. The bank said it could not predict when or how much aid it would request. `` At this time it is not possible to determine the ultimate likelihood, amount, nature or timing of any <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- assistance for any recapitalization, nor is it possible to predict the impact of the transaction on <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s stockholders and creditors,'' the bank said in a statement attributed to <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cater </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsanos </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the agency would not have any comment on the matter. `` Our standard practice is that we do n't comment on requests for assistance,'' he said. The bank's third-quarter results, due out by Tuesday, are expected to show a bigger jump in non-performing assets than the $ 158 million increase posted in the second quarter, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> also said it expects to have a net loss of $ 525 million for the third period, compared with a net loss of $ 73.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The company said it expects to record a provision for possible loan losses of about $ 370 million, making its allowance for bad loans approximately $ 690 million. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s stock had dropped a half dollar to hit a new low of 75 cents a share Tuesday, but bounced back to $ 1.12 -LCB- on Wednesday and Thursday. Friday's announcement pushed it down to 87 -LCB- cents. The request to be filed with the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> will suggest that <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> raise new capital from private investors, including current stockholders, to accompany the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> assistance, the statement said. `` MCorp continues to maintain adequate funding to meet the needs of its customers even though the recent economic challenges in our region have put enormous pressures on our situation,'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. `` We believe that an early resolution by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> of our assistance proposal will be the most cost-effective alternative for the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> has 26 banks and 86 banking offices throughout the state. The company had assets of $ 20.1 billion as of June 30. Total deposits were $ 16.1 billion and total loans were $ 12.2 billion _ 36 percent of that in real estate loans. It was the only major <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bank not to have resorted to a federal bailout or purchase by an out-of-state banking company. Earlier this year, Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest bank-holding company, sought federal assistance and ultimately was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was rescued by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> banker <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>. A federal review of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s loan portfolio is expected to be made public soon. Observers have been saying the review by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Comptroller of the Currency examiners will force <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> to significantly increase reserves for loan losses in the third quarter. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, a senior deputy comptroller, said the report is complete, but he has declined to elaborate on its findings. The Journal reported that the government's examination discovered worse-than-expected weakness in <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s loan portfolio. Quoting unidentified regulators and officials close to the company, the <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> said the review apparently had turned up more shaky real estate and commercial loans. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter financial results are expected to show a bigger jump in non-performing assets than the $ 158 million increase it posted in the second quarter, the newspaper said. MCorp was formed in October 1984 by the merger of <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> had 69 member banks and total assets of $ 20 billion. Since its formation, it raised $ 247 million of private capital in 1985, has raised $ 653 million in cash and securities through the sale of its MNet and MTech subsidiaries, and has cut costs. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> ranked 35th among the nation's largest banking organizations in terms of total assets on June 30.

 <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 7.1 million in the third quarter in contrast to a loss of $ 70 million in the same period a year earlier. However, results were not as strong as in this year's second quarter, when the company made $ 26.1 million. Revenue in the third quarter was $ 285.5 million, up from $ 261 million a year earlier but down from $ 308 million in this year's second quarter Chairman and Chief Executive Officer W.J. Sanders III blamed the decline from the spring figures on a drop in orders for microprocessors from personal computer manufacturers. He predicted a continued slump. `` We believe that a period of digestion of component inventories on the part of our customers will keep a lid on new orders and hence our sales growth for the next several quarters,'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> continued. <ORGANIZATION> AMD </ORGANIZATION> announced it will continue with plans to close its oldest operating silicon wafer factory in December and reduce its workforce in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> by 1,400.

 Technical market problems incited the panic last October on Wall Street, not nervousness about the economy, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said in defending proposed trading halts to escape another crisis. In a Friday interview with reporters to assess what has happened since the crisis nearly a year ago, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> conceded the `` circuit breakers'' proposal for coordinated trading halts with other exchanges is an artificial restraint on the free-trading system, which he dislikes in theory. `` I think all of us in general do n't like to shut markets down because it ruins liquidity,'' the chairman of the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities market said. `` But there are a few points in time when you need to shut it down.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> jointly proposed the circuit breaker plan in July. The proposal, under review by federal regulatory agencies and contingent on approval by other exchanges, calls for a one-year test in which predetermined price drops would trigger temporary trading halts. <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> trading would stop for an hour if the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 250 points, and for two hours if the average fell an additional 150 points the same day. At the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchange, the nation's largest futures market, trading would stop for an hour if the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock index futures contract fell 30 points and for two hours if it fell a further 20 points the same day. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> markets would coordinate the exact timing of the halts. It was frantic selling of large amounts of stock in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, coupled with plunging stock-index futures in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, that were scrutinized as important catalysts in the Oct. 19-20 panic. Lack of coordination between the two trading centers increased the panic because investors had no idea what prices should be. This market alienation was singled out as an important weakness by government investigations. In the months since, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said, it has become clear that the crash was caused by `` technical reasons within the market, and not because of fundamental shifts in the economy.'' While he said the chances of a similar rout seemed more remote now, `` at some point in time we'll go off through a fundamental shift in the economy and so then, if it -LRB- the Dow average -RRB- does go down 250 points, there's no guarantee that it's not going to go down another 500 points.'' Under the circuit-breaker remedy, he said, `` if you take it down in steps, so that everybody knows what it's doing, you're probably better socially and politically to do it that way than to just let it go through its extremes and then find its equilibrium.'' Critics of the circuit-breaker strategy say it could drive investors overseas to less restrictive markets. Moreover, they say, it could hasten a market panic if investors decide to sell their stocks at the same time, hoping to get out of the market before a trading halt takes effect. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> and other defenders of the proposal argue that such halts can have a calming effect on the market, giving everybody an opportunity to think rationally rather than sell in a blind panic. `` Anyway I think it's worth a try,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said. `` Hopefully you do n't have to use it very much.''

<HEAD>Unemployment Drops; Stock Market Jumps</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>

 The latest government report on the unemployment picture has drawn raves on Wall Street. The nation's jobless rate fell to 5.4 percent in September, nearing its lowest point since the early 1970s. But that was n't the good news for investors. Rather, stockholders and bondholders were encouraged that details of th report indicated the economy and employment are growing more slowly than expected. Too-strong growth raises fears of inflation. The jobless rate's decline from 5.6 percent in August left it at the same level as July and only one tick above the 14-year-low of 5.3 percent in June, when many people feared the economy was growing too quickly. However, there were other signs that the economy's growth was not so fast. The total number of factory jobs was down by 37,000. Out of the total of 255,000 new jobs overall, more than 100,000 were teachers returning to the classroom. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 42.50 points to 2,150.25 on Friday, falling only a few points short of the 1988 closing high of 2,158.61 it reached on July 5. `` If you were -LRB- Republican nominee -RRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, I do n't think you could have written a better set of numbers,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The jobless report also helped the bond market Friday, which is highly sensitive to inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond jumped about 1 11-16 points, or $ 16.87 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price and is an indicator of interest rate trends, tumbled to 8.79 percent from 8.94 percent late Thursday. The dollar finished the day slightly lower. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, money-market economist for <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the data provided `` further evidence that the economy is slowing down from the robust pace of expansion in the first half of the year.'' In another report Friday, the nation's business leaders, enjoying high profits from the strongest economic growth in four years, predicted a slowdown in 1989. Executives ranging from <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said their industries are generating very strong earnings Nevertheless, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, composed of 62 chief executives of large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations, said they would prefer less robust growth and a `` soft landing'' next year to the alternative: higher inflation, rising interest rates and finally a recession, or a `` hard landing.'' One reason for the drop in the jobless rate is that there were fewer people in the labor force, said <PERSON> Mishel </PERSON>, an economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal think tank financed largely by labor unions. `` The whole reason why <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been able to achieve low unemployment rates is that the population growth slowed by a third in the 1980s,'' <PERSON> Mishel </PERSON> said. `` President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had the Baby Boom coming into the labor market and had to create a lot more jobs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has enjoyed the effects of the Baby Bust.''

 Oil futures prices have risen in what analysts said was a technical rally inspired by the expiration of November options and efforts to square trading positions before the weekend. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> rose 28 cents Friday to settle at $ 12.94 a barrel. Among refined products traded on the exchange, the November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.63 cent to settle at 40.13 cents a gallon, while home heating oil rose 0.22 cent to 37.46 cents a gallon. Prices moved erratically in a narrow range during the day, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON> of the oil futures research department at <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. But he said short-covering, in which traders who have sold borrowed contracts buy contracts to square their positions, drove prices higher. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Redoglia </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>, said there was also some buying connected with the expiration of November options. `` The pressure on the market is still there.

Earlier in the week, crude oil prices tumbled below $ 13 a barrel to their lowest level in two years as <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest oil exporter, threatened to produce more than its quota if other members of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries continued to pump beyond their quotas The Saudis have indicated they want to punish other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members for overproducing and driving down the price of oil.
