 <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> wants $ 54 million from the federal government to avoid bankruptcy, but federal officials said Tuesday that bailing out this celebrated tourist mecca would set a bad precedent. Presidential press spokesman <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Henrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> told reporters that if President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> helps <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, `` the next day there will be a line of 4,000 mayors knocking on the door of the presidential palace.'' Rio Mayor <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Saturnino </PERSON> <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> said last week that his city of 5 million people was broke and could not pay its debts or the salaries of 100,000 municipal employees unless <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> received federal aid. <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s second-largest city and a major tourist attraction. But Finance Minister <PERSON> Mailson </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> has refused the city's request to issue $ 54 million in emergency bonds. <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> has been hurt in the last few decades by the transfer of the federal capital to <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> and the flight of industry to <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, the nation's largest city. Today, <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> owes about $ 150 million to Brazilian creditors and another $ 150 million in foreign debts. The city has projected a budget deficit of close to $ 180 million this year. <PERSON> Saturnino </PERSON> <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> warned that the city may have to cut off school lunches and medical supplies to city hospitals unless its credit is extended. The mayor, a former economist who belongs to the fledgling Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, also said the city was considering selling the <ORGANIZATION> Nelson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Piquet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autodrome </ORGANIZATION>, named for its famous race car driver and the site of the annual Brazilian Formula 1 Grand Prix. He predicted financial chaos unless the city received aid. `` There could be a deterioration of the city. Chaos. General strikes, deterioration of public services and the conservation of the city. But we'll do everything possible to avoid bankruptcy'' he said in an interview over the weekend with the Jornal do Brasil newspaper of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>.

 Associated Press Writer = <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ At least 100,000 of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children are homeless on any given night and that does n't include those who have run away from home or been kicked out by their parents, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> estimated Monday While male alcoholics and former mental patients still make up a large portion of the homeless, the fastest growing group of people with no place to live are children under 18, said the academy's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> `` The committee feels strongly that the growing phenomenon of homeless children is nothing short of a national disgrace that must be treated with the urgency that such a situation demands,'' said the report. One recommendation aimed directly at helping children: Federal support for enriched day care and Head Start programs should be expanded and coupled with outreach efforts to make homeless parents aware of help available for their children. A recommendation for the homeless in general: Permit the use of food stamps at restaurants so prepared meals will be available to people who do n't have kitchens. A controversy has erupted over the report, triggered by a majority of the committee formed by the institute to do the study, which was ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Ten of the 13 members of that panel, chaired by <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, endorsed a supplemental statement that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> refused to publish in the report. The only mention of it appears in a footnote on page 136 of the 242-page book. It says, in part, that the committee members `` unanimously wish to express their strong feeling that the recommendations are too limited in addressing the broader issues of homelessness _ especially the supply of low-income housing, income maintenance, the availability of support services, and access to health care for the poor and uninsured.'' <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON>, interviewed Monday night by telephone, said he supports the supplemental statement because the report as published, which focuses on health and human needs of the homeless, `` does n't adequately convey our sense of outrage and dismay at the phenomenon of homelessness. He said the supplementary statement calls for three specifics: `` First, an expansion of federal support of low-income housing to at least the 1981 budget levels from which they've been cut 70 percent since; `` Second, for development of a range of community-based residential treatment services for the mentally ill and substance abusers, and `` Third, for increasing the minimum wage to a level that makes adequate housing affordable.'' Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, blocked publication of the statement. He was quoted in Tuesday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying he did so because `` the language was charged and polemical and emotional. `` The academy has a certain credibility to maintain and must assure <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the executive branch that it will stick to the data and minimize the intrusion of values as much as possible,'' Press said. `` This panel was so repelled by what they saw that they wanted to go beyond their charge and give their views. We told them that was not our process. If they wanted to do it, they had to do it independently.'' He said he was glad the members were issuing their statement but said the main report was `` terrific as it stands.'' In the report, the committee applauded changes that allow use of food stamps at shelters and soup kitchens. But it said operators of those facilities need to be educated in the principles of sound nutrition and the special nutritional needs of the homeless. The committee also sought to dismiss fears of city government officials who might conclude that increasing their efforts to help the homeless would only draw more homeless people to their cities. The great majority of homeless people are long-term residents of the city where they live, the committee said. What's more, it said, what causes homeless people to move to another city is the prospect for work, not the prospect for welfare. If jobs are n't available, they tend not to stay long. As for homeless children, the report said there are no national studies pinning down the numbers, but using `` even the most conservative estimates'' would mean that: _ On any given night, 735,000 people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have no home in which to sleep and must resort to streets, shelters, institutions or other makeshift quarters Citing research by the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a homeless advocacy group, the committee concluded that 1.3 million to 2 million people will be homeless for one night or more in the course of a year. _ Most of the 735,000 homeless on any given night are alone, but at least a quarter of them are members of families and 55 percent of the family members are children Thus, the report concludes, `` a minimum of 100,000 children are homeless on any given night of the year'' and that figure counts only children in intact families and leaves out `` runaway, throwaway or abandoned children.'' The study did not detail how it concluded that `` children under the age of 18, usually as part of a family headed by a mother, are the fastest growing group among the many subpopulations of the homeless.'' All statistics on the homeless are difficult to come up with, the report acknowledged. In that connection, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that it will make a special effort in 1990 to count the homeless. On March 20 of that year, census takers will visit emergency shelters from 6 p.m. to midnight and street locations where the homeless often congregate between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. The report said most homeless children are in families headed by the mother and it found that homeless mothers frequently have no one to call on even in severe emergencies. It cited one <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> study in which 43 percent of the mothers could not name any one person to depend upon in a time of stress `` and almost a quarter named their minor child as their principal source of emotional support.'' During 10 months of research, the committee and its staff visited agencies serving the homeless in 11 cities _ <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ and rural areas in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. `` Those who stay in rural areas remain hidden until some event causes them to lose their housing, at which point they can be found living in, for example, cars, abandoned buildings, and woods,'' the report said. The study says the major causes of homelessness are: _ A decrease in the number of housing units for low-income people _ 2.5 million fewer than in 1980 _ while the number of people who can only affod such units has increased because of skyrocketing housing costs _ A tightening of eligibility for public assistance programs as well as a decline in the value of such assistance _ Policies of state mental hospitals, general hospitals, rehabilitation facilities and some jails and prisons that have fewer people admitted and free some who were previously held `` One result of these factors is that the system for providing temporary shelter for people who are homeless has been burdened beyond its capacity,'' with people staying for months rather than days, the report says. The study says health problems both cause and result from homelessness. Alcoholism, drug abuse, mental illness and the fatal disease AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, often results in people losing jobs and homes, it noted. Many diseases are complicated by homelessness and illnesses such as exposure, hypothermia, skin disorders. In addition, accidents, muggings and rapes are often the result of the victim having no home, the study says.

<TEXT>
 Representatives of the Nicaraguan government and rebel leaders met for the first time in three months Monday but broke off talks after failing to agree on a new location for resuming peace negotiations. The rebel delegation rejected the government's demand that future talks to end the 7-year-old civil war take place in the Nicaraguan capital of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, rebel leader <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said after the meeting. The rebels proposed <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> as alternative sites for high-level negotiations, <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said. Monday's meeting had been called as a preliminary step to resuming the peace talks that collapsed June 9. The four-hour session was the first meeting between the leftist government and the U.S.-backed rebels since talks collapsed. A possible second day of talks on Tuesday was ruled out, and no date for another meeting was announced. <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said rebels were open to considering new proposals on a location for the talks, and the government has said it would keep trying to persuade the rebels to bargain in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said he reiterated a rebel proposal that high-level talks be held Sept. 26-28, but not in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The proposal was contained in a letter he submitted to Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, head of the government delegation, and was made available to reporters. The rebels, known as Contras, also demanded the government release more than 40 opposition demonstrators arrested in July and guarantee freedom of expression as a precondition to further talks. <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said that during previous talks in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, rebel leaders `` felt like prisoners in their own country'' and added, `` our telephone conversations were listened to.'' He did not elaborate. In a separate press conference, <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said the government was sticking by its position that the talks be held in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. A fragile March 21 cease-fire remains in effect in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but each side accuses the other of violating the truce. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> had said before the meeting Monday he expected it to result in `` a cease-fire for 30 or 60 days that could be extended indefinitely.'' There was no announcement on extending the cease-fire. Both sides had agreed on March 23 to seek a negotiated settlement to the conflict the government says has claimed the lives of 28,000 Nicaraguans. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said Monday that that agreement called for <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> as the site of peace negotiations. The agreement called on the rebels to lay down their arms in exchange for democratic reforms. Shortly before peace talks broke off in June, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> proposed a timetable for disarmament and political reforms. But the Contras rejected the plan, saying it did not go far enough. They demanded freedom for political prisoners and democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> before disarming. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> will urge that a cease-fire verification commission funded by $ 10 million from congress be put into operation. Commission members would include the secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, and Nicaraguan Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> also reiterated the government's demand that the Contras free 66 prisoners of war being held in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. He blamed the Contras for ending peace talks on June 9. `` The Contras broke them off to seek military aid in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels ended Feb. 29, and the Contras have few bargaining chips left. Non-lethal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras is distributed only in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. During the past four months, most of the rebel forces fled back to base camps inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to receive new supplies of uniforms and food. Contra sources say only 2,000 fighters remain inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> while more than 9,000 are holed up in isolated camps in eastern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The cease-fire pact in March caused deep divisions within the rebel ranks. Militant Contras, led by <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, a former colonel under the deposed <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> dictatorship, said the agreement was tantamount to surrender.

 The crucial <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> waterway must remain under Iraqi control and can not be used by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as a negotiating tool in peace talks to end their 8-year-old war, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s foreign minister was quoted as saying Monday Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said the waterway, the delta of the <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> rivers and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s sole outlet to the sea, should remain under Iraqi control as `` a historical, logical, legal and a just matter,'' according to the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, speaking at a press conference, said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> rejects what he said was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s use of the waterway as a means to pressure <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the U.N.-mediated peace talks that started in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Aug. 25, the agency reported. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is demanding sovereignty over the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> estuary and that the outlet be cleared of sunken ships and silt. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s first wants to negotiate the withdrawal of both side's troops to internationally recognized borders, the exchange of war prisoners and a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigation to determine who started the war.

<TEXT>
 In the country's agricultural heartland, old ingrained fears tinge the debate over the referendum next month on Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s presidency. For prosperous landowners, frightening memories of farm seizures by leftist peasants in the early 1970s has helped push them solidly into the pro-Pinochet camp. `` This is the fear we have, of returning to the past,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Olea </PERSON>, owner of a 100-acre spread here in the country's fertile <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> But for struggling farm workers, the prospect of reprisal by their bosses or local officials is keeping many from openly voicing dissent. Some say resentment with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s authoritarian rule, and with a hand-to-mouth existence, will find expression in the ballot box. `` At least before there was work, and the worker had the right to express his opinion,'' said laborer <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, as he painted a tractor by the roadside. Two farmhands with him made similar comments, but refused to give their names. Chileans will decide Oct. 5 in a yes or no ballot on a new term for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the right-wing army commander who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup and has already ruled longer than any previous president. If a majority vote for him, he will remain as president until 1997, but the military junta that he has headed as the governing body since 1973 will be disbanded. If he loses, open elections will be held in a year and he must hand over power in 1990, when a new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, two-thirds elected and one-third appointed, will go into place. <PERSON> Farmowner </PERSON> <PERSON> Olea </PERSON> and others like him have benefited from an export-oriented, free-market economic program carried out by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s administration. Foreign sales of grapes and other fruit, much of it grown in the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, have been booming. With government credits and technological assistance, many farm owners are expanding production and making solid profits. But they have not forgotten the chaotic, radical reform programs launched by President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a self-declared Marxist elected in 1970 and toppled in the coup led by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> three years later. <PERSON> Olea </PERSON>'s home and land were illegally seized by peasants. He negotiated with them so he could live in his house, which also had been taken over, while they worked his land as they liked. `` We lived through a savage lack of order,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Aullet </PERSON>, who is partner with his brother <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> in a 70-acre farm. `` There was no respect for your home, your land.'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aullet </PERSON> said the Allende government sent `` experts'' with no knowledge of agriculture to supervise land reform programs. `` What we fear is -LRB- that kind of -RRB- ignorance,'' he said. The landowners said that, with the production boom, conditions for farm workers were improving significantly. `` Manpower is becoming scarce, and there's competition in salaries to attract workers,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aullet </PERSON> said. `` Anyone who wants work can find it.'' The Aullets said that at the height of the harvesting season, workers could not be found for less than 1,000 pesos, about twice the minimum legal daily wage and equivalent to about $ 4. Their positive vision of rural <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> is shared by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s campaign strategists, who predict overwhelming voter support from the heartland Opposition leaders contend that the countryside's poor majority are suffering economically and are eager for a change but wo n't say so publicly because they fear losing their jobs or government benefits, such as pensions and housing subsidies. The opposition's political campaign is aimed at overcoming such fears, while recognizing them as legitimate. One prominent campaign slogan in the countryside is `` Say yes, but vote no.'' Several farm workers said harvesting jobs paid an average 700 pesos, or less than $ 3 a day, and lasted only a few months a year. `` You ca n't live on that,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>, who sells bread from the back of his small, battered truck in the countryside around <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION>, said most of his customers opposed <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s continued rule. `` I travel 50 kilometers -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- a day, and I can tell you there are a lot more people for the ` no' vote than the ` yes' vote,'' he said But he added: `` Lots of people may vote ` yes' because they're afraid. He said that in one remote town on his bread route, <LOCATION> Tinguiririca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, `` people are telling each other that if you vote ` no,' you'll be arrested.'' The government has said the vote will be secret, and the opposition has publicized its plans to have representatives at each polling place to prevent intimidation.

 <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> skips across the stage, bullying subordinates and singing his joy at another war. Commodore <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> orders the beginning of the Battle of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to a Latin jazz accompaniment. `` Manifest Destiny: An Evening of Yankee Panky,'' opening Wednesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a five-show run, is the unlikeliest of musicals _ a bittersweet history of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 1898 takeover of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, written by that nation's foreign secretary, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>. Inspired by the musical `` 1776,'' which ran on Broadway from 1969 to 1971, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> wrote `` Yankee Panky'' 14 years ago, while on a self-imposed exile from the authoritarian rule of President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` He thought a musical would be a painless way to show a neglected part of our nation's history,'' said his son <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, who is producing the play. `` He really researched it. The information that he gained for the play he's really using right now.'' `` Right now'' refers to <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>' protracted negotiations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over the future of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the islands. He was appointed foreign secretary last year by President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. As a negotiator, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> has demanded a steep increase in the amount of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid in exchange for continued use of the bases, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military complex on foreign soil. As a playwright, he provides an insight into why some Filipinos consider the military outposts an odious vestige of American rule. In `` Yankee Panky,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats beguile Philippine rebels, promising them arms, support and independence if they defeat the Spanish colonialists, but offering no written guarantees. Straw-hatted American businessmen plot to wean Filipinos from fruit juices to soft drinks and create new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export markets. The garrulous Roosevelt is portrayed nearly to satiric excess, smoking cigars, grinning and barking: `` I say you ca n't civilize without the use of force.'' With a score that ranges from Tin Pan Alley to bossa nova, `` Yankee Panky'' explores the broken promises, the bloody suppression of a Philippine war of independence in 1899-1901 and the battle for the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> mind that ensued. The nation finally gained independence in 1946. `` The goal of this play is to destroy certain myths that people still cling to,'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said during a rehearsal. `` There's this myth that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a ` special relationship' with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not looking out for our interests; it is looking out for its interests.'' <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> wrote the play while on a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION> to study Philippine-American relations from 1898 to 1902. A musical was a natural vehicle for the 69-year-old <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>. At home on the piano, xylophone and drums, he had written songs to cheer fellow prisoners of the Japanese in World War II. Later he led a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Dixieland band _ The Executives _ that jammed with <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, a part-time jazz clarinetist. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> and director <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Pudenz </PERSON> tried to stage `` Yankee Panky'' in 1980, `` but the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> was n't front-page news then,'' the younger <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said. After <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was toppled, `` Yankee Panky'' became a success in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, and a recent crop of political plays on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> encouraged <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Pudenz </LOCATION> to take a plunge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Its 35-member cast performs traditional Philippine dances and sings lyrics that range from superficial -LRB- `` To spread civilization; To improve sanitation'' -RRB- to savage -LRB- `` They like to play the democrat; And never teach the little brown brat.'' -RRB- <PERSON> Pudenz </PERSON> hopes its run at the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Divine in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is a prelude for another presentation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We would love to do it in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, so that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could see it, and understand a little bit more,'' <PERSON> Pudenz </PERSON> said.

 The race for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> between <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> and Democratic challenger <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> has been disrupted by a third-party candidate, a maverick legislator who was nominated at a convention held in a fast-food restaurant. <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, a former one-term governor who is leading in the polls, boycotted Sunday what was to have been the second of eight campaign debates after organizers agreed to include state Sen. <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, candidate of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> said Monday he would engage in future debates with <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> only if the incumbent barred Chambers and renounced the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> characterized as a fringe group bent on disrupting the political process. `` The issue is whether the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> deserves to be in our debates,'' <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> said. `` I have said no. I have said that a party of 14 members, that holds its nominating convention in Booth No. 2 at <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s Restaurant should not be included.'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> called Chambers a legitimate candidate who had a right to participate in the debates. But on Monday, <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> said he would `` not be debating any further'' and blamed <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> for the breakdown. `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> is the debate-buster in this campaign,'' he said. `` I believe <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> has accomplished his goal of destroying the debate process. I do not believe it will do me any good to continue.'' The first debate certainly did <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> little good. Speaking at the State Fair in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> on Sept. 5, he was booed when he said `` we need fewer farmers.'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, who in one of his commercials picks up a bale of hay and is described as the farmer-senator, said the remark was a slip of the tongue. <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, a lawyer for an <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> grain company, was plucked from political obscurity in 1986 when newly elected GOP Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> chose him to succeed Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON>, who died of a heart attack. Analysts believe <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> stands to gain from Chambers' candidacy. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, who is black, is very popular in the predominantly low-income, Democratic-voting <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> district he has represented in the Legislature for 18 years. Blacks make up about 12 percent of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>'s population and there are few blacks in the state outside its largest city. Chambers, a barber, has a long history of controversy in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> politics. While most state senators wear suits on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> wears a sweat shirt and blue jeans. He once called <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> a `` great man'' and said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was `` a Rambo-esque character in the last stages of senility.'' Chambers acknowledged that his candidacy could hurt <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, but added, `` It would be a mistake, it would diminish me as a person and the significance of what I'm about, to say I'm running this race to stop <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said. `` I want to stop both of them _ I want to win.'' But stopping the Democrats nationally is an avowed goal of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a black-led organization that describes itself as multiracial, leftist, opposed to <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> aid and nuclear weapons and favoring more rights for women and homosexuals. In <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> last week, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alliance </LOCATION> presidential candidate <PERSON> Lenora </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON> said her campaign sought to `` dump <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' `` It would give me great joy to spoil for a party that has come into the Afro-American community and other communities in this county and taken our vote, taken our hope, taken our desire and turned it into a Dukakis-Lloyd <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ticket,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON> said. An <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION> poll released Sunday showed <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> favored by 51 percent of the 755 registered voters questioned by telephone statewide Sept. 14-16. <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> was favored by 33 percent and <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> had 4 percent. Eleven percent said they were undecided. The poll had a margin of error of 3.6 percent. Ironically, <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> was the original <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> nominee. In the May 10 primary, the former governor received 20 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> write-in votes and <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> finished fourth with five votes. <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> declined the nomination, and <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> was chosen in July at a state convention held at a <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s Restaurant. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, who also was running unopposed for re-election to his seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, accepted the nomination. After the courts ruled he could not run for two offices simultaneously, Chambers elected to remain on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ballot and said he would mount a write-in legislative campaign.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s 10-day swing through <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has paradoxically served to reduce the stigma of any future visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, while firmly including the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> as a player in efforts to solve the region's conflicts. An unexpected touchdown in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, involvement in a hostage drama in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, and quiet diplomacy to nudge <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> away from confrontation marked a trip which initially had only the trappings of the fourth papal pastoral visit to the continent. `` You could say it was an act of grace,'' commented <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Agostino </PERSON> <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON>, pondering the consequences after bad weather forced a landing in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the very country whose racial policies the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> excoriated at his first touchdown in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. Before <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, some bishops and African leaders urged him to strike the nation of apartheid from any future travel, but by the time the pope landed in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Monday night, few voices against a future stopover had been raised. Even the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> anti-apartheid leader who attended a papal ecumenical papal meeting in <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, stopped short of discouraging a trip, despite his charges that the pope had been too soft on the white minority government. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> prelates confirmed the pope would fly to <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> in 1989, and that he was considering a visit to rigidly Marxist <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. A customary Vatican procedure is to include countries of the same region on one trip, making the prospect of a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> trip in the near future a distinct possibility. After all, the pope had now landed at Jan Smuts airport, sipped tea with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, ridden 190 miles in a bulletproof government sedan, stopped for refreshments at an Afrikaner gas station and visited people injured in the storming in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> of a hijacked bus, during which six people were killed by South African commandos. The pope, who has rarely held back from sensitive subjects on his foreign tours, continued to speak out: _ He lectured the 20-year-old king of <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and his four wives about polygamy _ He repeatedly nudged <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s Marxist government, overwhelmed by 6 million people on the edge of famine and by the ravages of a civil war, to sit down at the negotiating table with rebels, offering the church's help if needed The latter subject was all the more delicate since President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>'s government until recently held on to confiscated church property, while the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> _ a shadowy group holding much of the country _ tried to depict itself to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and the outside world as anti-communist, and thus in favor of religious freedom. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> set his own agenda in some of the most graphic speeches of any papal trip, exclaming: `` Yes, my beloved brothers, I have felt the heart of this country bleed ... I am taking home images of suffering ... the worried gaze of many children, the look of uncertainty of so many youths, the tired eyes of so many adults and the sad look of the aged.'' Becoming unusually specific, he has permitted Mozambican bishops to encourage negotiations between the government and rebels, while backing a government program of amnesty which has already convinced 2,000 rebels to lay down their weapons. `` The pope's trip was like rain on scorched earth,'' commented <PERSON> Nampula </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vieira </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON>, saying it marked a turning point in church-state relations. On the government side, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabaco </PERSON>, head of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> FRELIMO </ORGANIZATION> party's foreign relations department, said <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> could endorse practically everything the pope had recommended. <PERSON> Cabaco </PERSON> added that the government also felt encouraged by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s efforts to revive a non-aggression pact and economic cooperation with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and by the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s worldwide appeal for aid. According to diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> _ as it has done in the case of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and other countries _ is dangling the prospect of formal diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> as an incentive for it to continue supporting the regional peace process and the thaw in religious freedom.

<HEAD>Rebel-Ordered Transport Ban Largely Heeded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A vast majority of bus and truck drivers heeded a nationwide transportation ban called by leftist rebels despite assurances from the military that traffic would be protected. Only a handful of mass transit buses circulated Monday in this capital of 1 million inhabitants, forcing workers to walk to their jobs or pay inflated fares to pickup truck and van owners. More than 70 percent of urban bus traffic was halted and inter-city service was even more severely curtailed, an official of the bus owners' association told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. A dispatcher at one of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s two terminals said 90 percent of the bus service between provinces was stopped. The indefinite ban on bus and truck traffic was the fifth called this year by Marxist-led guerrillas waging a nearly 9-year-old war against the U.S.-backed government. Previous rebel bans lasted three days each. The government urged citizens to ignore Monday's ban, saying the military would protect vehicles. Col. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, the army chief of operations, told <ORGANIZATION> YSU </ORGANIZATION> radio that about 13,000 soldiers were providing and protecting transport. `` We refuse to allow a violent minority to impose its will on us,'' he said. Soldiers rode shotgun aboard several state-owned buses circulating in the capital and some army trucks carried passengers to and from the city outskirts. <PERSON> Lorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLeon </PERSON>, a 48-year-old father of six, was stranded at the eastern bus terminal with no way to get to his tailor's job in <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>, 35 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` This hurts the poor worker more than anyone. We do n't work today, we get our pay docked,'' he said. Rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said the ban was in response to the actions of riot troops who broke up a Sept. 13 demonstration by leftist university students. The troops used tear gas and clubs and fired shots in the air to disperse nearly 3,000 students at that protest. About 250 demonstrators were arrested. All but 14 were subsequently released, with the remainder charged with what the government called `` terrorist acts.''

<HEAD>Tighter Controls Needed on Dairy Promotion Program, Audit Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A national dairy promotion program financed by dairy farmers should be tightened to eliminate slipshod accounting methods, waste and unauthorized use of funds, an Agriculture Department audit says. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of inspector general criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which administers the program, for not providing adequate guidelines and controls over those sharing in the funds, and for submitting incomplete information to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` AMS' annual report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not include information relating to approximately 60 percent of the activities of the program,'' the auditors said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had not been informed as to the accountability of approximately $ 374.4 million of $ 619.7 million of the Dairy Promotion Program assessments for the three-year period ending April 30, 1987.'' The inspector general's office said it was looking into at least one case of possible fraud. However, it declined to provide details and said only that a report on the investigation would be issued later. The program was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a 1983 law that imposes a mandatory assessment of 15 cents for each 100 pounds of milk produced and marketed in the 48 contiguous states. Producers may assign up to 10 cents of the assessment to regional or state qualified programs, or QPs, that have similar promotional projects. But at least 5 cents of the assessment must be sent to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which consists of 36 dairy farmers appointed by the secretary of agriculture. The board finances national promotional programs, including television commercials, to help sell more milk and other dairy products, all subject to review by AMS officials. According to the report, which has been circulating recently within the dairy industry and the department, auditors looked into the use of program funds during the period of May 1985 through May 1987 and `` other periods as deemed necessary.'' During that period, approximately 291 billion pounds of milk were marketed, with an assessment of around $ 436.9 million, of which almost $ 168.2 million was remitted to the national board and $ 268.7 million credited to the QPs. The audit report said: _ Five of the 18 QPs reviewed passed $ 14.7 million of $ 15.6 million in assessment funds collected to other QPs and incurred approximately $ 235,000 in administrative costs _ Two other QPs improperly used $ 106,500 for activities such as school activity funds, athletic tournaments, support of veterinary services, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and other miscellaneous accounts _ Five QPs with assessments funds totaling about $ 20.5 million had internal control weaknesses such as separation of duties, management of promotional materials and procurement systems _ Four QPs incurred $ 2.4 million in administrative costs in excess of the 5 percent limit set by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> `` In the absence of guidelines concerning the use of the assessment funds, the QPs and an affiliated organization, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- of <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> -RRB-, had only their discretion to follow,'' the report said. Auditors said they questioned the association's classification of `` about $ 5.8 million of administrative costs as program costs, $ 1,500 in monthly per diem to the <ORGANIZATION> UDIA </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman of the board of directors and $ 85 per diem per day in excess of travel-related expenses to members of the <ORGANIZATION> UDIA </ORGANIZATION> board.'' The report recommended a general tightening up of procedures, including accounting by the QPs on how the money is spent. Also, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> should `` devise and implement guidelines'' that organizations must follow before getting any funds. In its comments, the AMS agreed to some of the audit report's recommendation but said its authority on others was limited and that action by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may be required `` If the department concludes that such additional oversight is desirable, AMS would be willing to discuss'' with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the purpose and legislative intent of the law authorizing the dairy promotion program, the marketing service said.

 When it comes to curbing the cotton boll weevil, it's a matter of timing and tillage rather than how much pesticide is used, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. A seven-year study in the lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> led to a new state law last year that requires farmers to destroy cotton stalks by Sept. 15. By shredding the stalks and then following up with deep plowing, the destructive weevils are deprived of winter shelter and food when they are dormant. Entomologist <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Summy </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says in a report that the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> study showed that farmers applied pesticides 15 times to 18 times a year in 1980 and 1981. But in 1984, following a year of `` moderate'' stalk destruction, chemicals only had to be applied three or four times, he said. From 1985 to 1987, pesticide use rose again, sometimes equaling 1981 levels, because farmers did n't destroy the cotton stalks. Last year the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> legislature passed the law requiring cotton growers to destroy stalks annually by Sept. 15 in the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> zone, later in other parts of the state. To help state officials enforce stalk destruction, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> scientists worked out a surveillance system for cotton fields by using infrared aerial photos to detect which fields are not plowed by the deadline, <PERSON> Summy </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ An upsurge in atrocities not seen in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> since the terror of the 29-year <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> dynasty appears to have triggered an army revolt that toppled the government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. Some see an opening for democratic reforms under <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s new leader, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, who announced on nationwide television Sunday that he was assuming the presidency `` to save the country from anarchy and chaos.'' But a Haitian government official said privately that <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> may be thwarted by the military high command, which the official said `` is not favorable to an opening toward the civilian sector and wants to maintain its privileges.'' Before the coup, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> was the army's adjutant general. Soldiers of the elite, 1,000-man Presidential Guard ousted <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and sent him to neighboring <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> early Sunday after several hours of sporadic gunfire that apparently caused no casualties. At least six people were reported killed, however, in what were described as reprisals against alleged Tonton Moucoutes thugs blamed for recent atrocities. In justifying the coup, Sgt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Heubreux </PERSON> said the noncommissioned officers who led it wanted to restore honor to the army and `` raise the prestige of the Haitian people degraded by so many acts which have revolted the conscience of the Haitian people and the world.'' It was <PERSON> Heubreux </PERSON> who appeared on television here to introduce <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> as the new president of this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island nation. Under <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> experienced increased random killings and intimidation of groups advocating democratic reform. In the worst recent outrage, about 20 hoodlums brandishing machetes, handguns and steel pikes burst into a Roman Catholic church during <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION> on Sept. 11 and slaughtered 13 people. Seventy-seven others were wounded. The toughs were identified as City Hall workers, and <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> were widely blamed for the attack. <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> is thought to be a leader of a Macoutes faction. He reportedly was arrested at the presidential palace shortly before the coup, then taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Dominican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. He remained there Monday, seeking political asylum and awaiting an exit visa. A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the church massacre was the apparent trigger for dissident noncomissioned officers who felt they were not getting proper pay and recognition. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> had helped <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> overthrow the 4-month-old civilian government of President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in a bloodless coup on June 19. The diplomat said of the dissident sergeants: `` Under <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> they felt slighted and snubbed. Under <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, they did not receive the material signs of recognition they expected. And on top of that, the atrocity ... -LRB- Sept. 11 -RRB- must have affected them as men-of-the-people.'' Among 19 demands the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> presented to the military high command on Sunday was a call for democracy, with free elections. It was uncertain whether the high command would agree to any democratic reforms. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s pledge to take part in a dialogue with opposition parties was generally welcomed, but popular politician <PERSON> Sylvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, remained skeptical. According to <PERSON> Claude </PERSON>, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> `` is known as a Duvalierist, and all Duvalierists are criminals.'' <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has been closely identified with the Duvalier regimes since the early 1960s, when he took part in the struggle against anti-Duvalierist guerrillas. <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> `` Papa Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> destroyed the political power of the army in the 1960s with his private militia of thugs, popularly known as <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>. Upon his death his son, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> `` Baby Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, succeeded him in 1971. After the fall of <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> in February 1986, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> was briefly an adviser to the junta headed by <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> was dismissed in March 1986 after popular protest demonstrations against him. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Birns </PERSON>, director of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemispheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, said the key to the future course of Haitian politics lies with Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, commander of the feared 700-man <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION>. The military high command was said to be resisting efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to elevate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to armed forces commander in chief. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has been indicated on drug trafficking charges by a federal court in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday that making <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> army commander `` would certainly give us an indication of the difficulties we will have with this government if he is appointed.'' <PERSON> Birns </PERSON> said, `` Although skeptical that democracy is near in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, I think it -LRB- the coup -RRB- is a hopeful sign. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s rule had degenerated into a highly eccentric and dangerous mode and something had to be done to get rid of him.'' `` Curiously enough, in recent weeks, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> ... has established close working relations with some democratic figures in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'' and soldiers from the <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION> had been sent to guard <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches recently. `` Of course, all these people -LRB- jockeying for authoritarian power -RRB- are thugs,'' <PERSON> Birns </PERSON> said. `` It's a question of relativity.''

<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who was virtually ignored by Polish newspapers and television for the past seven years, is suddenly staging a remarkable comeback in the state-controlled media. Two official publications last week ran interviews of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a newspaper printed a detailed profile of him, <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Polonia </PERSON> broadcast his words to its foreign audiences, and most state-run newspapers had front-page headlines last week such as, `` Kiszczak -LRB- the interior minister -RRB- Meets <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>.'' While <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is not quite yet a media celebrity in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, his name is getting into print again for the first time since martial law was imposed in 1981. The change comes as the official press has begun to push the line that greater dialogue is needed to solve the country's problems. Publication of the first interview Thursday, in the September issue of the monthly Confrontations, followed <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s agreement to end a wave of August strikes in return for the promise of a meeting with government officials that could lead to restoring his union's legal status <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, in the interview, called for legalization of Solidarity and for loosening central controls on the economy, politics and society. `` There must be Solidarity'' he said of the union which was suppressed under the martial-law crackdown of Dec. 13, 1981 and outlawed the following year. He added that Solidarity could not function solely as a trade union until `` social and political pluralism also gets into the act in earnest.'' Asked about the recent negotiations with Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, he said: `` It is either a big game in which you try to outmaneuver <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> once again, or it is really the opening of a new chapter in Polish history. I hope the latter is right.'' He called on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to abandon centralized economic planning and embrace a system to `` create possibilities.'' He added: `` Only in pluralism can I see a chance for progress and better living. As responsible people we should discuss how to leave behind a model which has not stood the test.'' <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, deputy editor of Confrontations, said the editors felt `` satisfaction, joy'' when they submitted the interview and got approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Censorship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to publish it. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> spoke to the two reporters at his home on Sept. 1, the same day he ended a strike at the Lenin shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. The two journalists also published a version of the interview in another magazine, Reporter. State-owned Radio Polonia, which beams official propaganda in 10 languages to other countries around the world, devoted six minutes Friday of its daily half-hour broadcasts to a <LOCATION> Walesa </LOCATION> interview, a station spokesman said. In the broadcast, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said both he and the government had learned something during the past seven years. `` You are the first Polish journalists of the officially published press since December 13, 1981, to ask me for an interview,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was quoted in the opening line of the Confrontations piece. The sudden attention to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> does not suit all Poles. After all, for years <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was referred to _ when at all _ only negatively, as a private person, as a former leader of a former union or as a tool of foreign powers. `` I think that Gen. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> should not talk to Mr. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> because Mr. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is just the same kind of citizen as all of us,'' said one man interviewed on the street by state television Saturday.

<HEAD>Study Says Many People Can't Collect On Nursing Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Six out of 10 people with private nursing home insurance are likely to receive no benefits because of restrictions on their policies, says a study released today by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seniors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION>. The study by the consumer advocacy group concludes `` many of the policies now being offered for sale ... are not likely to pay adequate benefits if and when people need them.'' While there may be a role for the private insurance industry in filling the national need for long-term care protection, `` this role should not include selling bad policies to unsuspecting consumers,'' the study said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Firman </PERSON>, president of the Washington-based group, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissert </PERSON>, director of the program on aging at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, conducted the study. They based their findings on an analysis of 77 typical private long-term health care insurance plans offered by 21 companies. The most common restriction, found in 77 percent of the plans, was that a person must first be hospitalized for his or her condition before being allowed to collect benefits for subsequent nursing home care. `` Fifty-four percent of nursing home admissions do not come directly from a hospital and will not qualify for coverage under a plan with this restriction,'' the report said. The other major limitation, included in 40 percent of the plans, said people must first receive skilled-level nursing home care before they can qualify for lower levels of long-term care. Such a requirement excludes 46 percent of nursing home residents, the study said. `` The effect of these exclusions is even more dramatic and troubling'' when combined with waiting periods and other restrictions, the report said. `` The average probability of not collecting benefits ... was 61 percent, if you are admitted to a nursing home.'' Although 95 percent of the plans studied said they cover patients with Alzheimer's disease, the researchers said 81 percent of the plans contain the two major restrictions regarding hospitalization and skilled care. `` Given the long duration and deteriorating characteristics of Alzheimer's disease, it is likely that for much of the patient's period of illness, these restrictions would preclude eligibility for coverage,'' they said The study said the most common type of nursing home coverage is a $ 50-a-day indemnity benefit _ an amount it labeled `` grossly inadequate'' to meet the expected costs of care. If someone purchased such a plan now and entered a nursing home in 20 years, the study said, out-of-pocket costs could reach up to $ 130,000 if the plan had no inflation protection. Two-thirds of the companies studied did not offer inflation protection. `` For most people who are in a nursing home for a long period of time, the effect of most of the plans we studied will be to delay but not to prevent eventual impoverishment,'' the researchers said. Fifty-six of the plans studied offered home health care coverage, but substantial restrictions `` make it unlikely that most persons in need of home care will collect significant benefits,'' the study said. The most common restriction is requiring a prior covered nursing home confinement before a policy-holder can tap into home care benefits. Other plans require only prior hospitalization, according to the report. Several lawmakers have introduced long-term care insurance schemes involving the federal government or joint public-private efforts; <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected to consider the matter seriously next year.

<HEAD>Census Planning Special Homeless Count</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A special effort to count the nation's homeless will be conducted as part of the 1990 Census <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Taeuber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that officials have decided to hold a separate count, a few days before the regular national census, in an effort to count those living on the streets and in shelters. The homeless have become an increasingly visible part of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society, but there are no concrete estimates of their numbers. On March 20, 1990, Census takers will visit emergency shelters, both public and private, and will go to various street locations which have been identified as places the homeless congregate, said <PERSON> Taeuber </PERSON>. The street search for the homeless will be conducted from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m., and shelters will be visited from 6 p.m. to midnight, she said. Census officials will be working with various groups and agencies that serve as advocates for the homeless, explained <PERSON> Taeuber </PERSON>, in order to determine in advance where to look for these people. In addition, the agency will encourage people with those groups, and the homeless themselves, to work as enumerators in the count. However, these workers will have to pass the same written exams and other criteria as all Census workers. Census day for most of the nation is April 1, 1990. The count of the homeless is being taken a few days early, however, because many shelters close at the end of March or beginning of April, <PERSON> Taeuber </PERSON> said. She added that the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> will not try to define who constitutes a homeless person. Instead it will merely issue counts of people living on the streets and those staying in various types of shelters.

 A shave and a haircut used to cost nothing, if you were a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> senator and were shaved and trimmed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> barber shop. And when one reform-minded senator tried to eliminate free senatorial shaving and hair cutting 37 years ago, his shaved-for-free colleagues rebelled. The senator was the late <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, and his experience was recalled in a recent <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> speech by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> had gone to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> barber shop for a haircut. `` After the barber had done his work,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> began to think that his income was ample enough to pay for his own haircut _ which then cost a dollar and a quarter _ and not charge it to the taxpayer.'' So <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> introduced an amendment to the annual legislative appropriations act to cut off funds for the barber shop unless it began charging senators for its services. The counterattack was not long coming. At a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing, Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> complimented <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> on his haircut, then recalled that the haircut issue was one that flared from time to time. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said that when he first came to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> he became disturbed at newspaper articles complaining about free senatorial haircuts and discussed the matter with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> veteran <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` Senator <PERSON> Borah </PERSON> said, ` You tell that reporter to go to the devil. I want the same service that was received here by <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C </PERSON>. <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON>.''' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> picked up the story, saying, `` After a good laugh, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> shouted down Senator <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' amendment, and the free haircut survived.'' But only for the monent. `` I want to assure taxpayers that today senators pay their own way when they have their hair cut, as Senator <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> tried and failed to accomplish 37 years ago,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. While they pay more than a dollar and a quarter, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> barbering charges may be a bit gentler than those of most commercial barbershops. The current charge for a haircut in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> barbershop is $ 4.50. More elaborate cuts are $ 6.50. Hair styling costs $ 9.00. A shave costs $ 4.00.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its industrial allies are trying to slow the development of missiles in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and hope to have the cooperation of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the global campaign against proliferation. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed on Monday that the seven allies, meeting in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Sept. 8-9, exchanged expressions of concern about missile proliferation and technology transfers that might enhance <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s capability. Afterward, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the same group registered concern in its deliberations about programs in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> may pursue the problem with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> during their talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday and Friday. In any event, the official said, Assistant Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> will take up the issue at talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week with <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, senior Soviet arms control negotiator. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s attempt to extend the range of its Scud B missile should demonstrate to the Soviets the proliferation problem extends to their region, the official said. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s attempt to develop the Sonda IV missile is the other program the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> discussed with representatives of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the official said. `` It was an attempt to keep everybody up to date in the area,'' the official said. `` They did not adopt any special program. That's not the way it works. Meanwhile, spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, referring to the medium-range Condor II that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> reportedly is developing with the help of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, said `` the basic concern is that we do what we can to limit this kind of technology because it is the kind of technology that produces missiles that would be nuclear-capable.'' He said they also would exceed `` the range of parameters we established,'' meaning a range beyond 180 miles and a payload in excess of 1,100 pounds. The seven countries agreed last year that they would not export missiles or technology for them that went beyond these limits. Meanwhile, an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> representative voiced concern about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s launch Monday of a test satellite into orbit and said it meant the Arabs would have to strengthen their defenses. <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, who represents the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the satellite gave <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` a serious strategic leverage'' since the country already had the capability to fire long-range missiles. <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, in an interview, stressed steps taken jointly by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to strengthen their strategic ties. He cited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inclusion of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the program to develop a space-based defense against ballistic missiles and `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s record, which is replete with disclaiming nuclear capability. As a result, <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said, the launching of a test satellite `` warrants enhancing Arab defensive capabilities'' so that any <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> negotiations produce a peaceful outcome `` rather than ratifying Israeli hegemony.'' The satellite is designed for communications purposes, but the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> official said it could be used to monitor <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s foes. `` We are deeply concerned that such a communications satellite can be modified into a spy system and, therefore, further enhance the strategic imbalance which the <LOCATION> American-Israeli </LOCATION> strategic agreement has introduced,'' <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not involved in any way with the Israeli program. `` We do n't have any details of the launch beyond what was reported by the Israelis,'' he said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, Cmdr. <PERSON> Dugald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillies </PERSON>, said American radars and sensors picked up the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> satellite shortly after launch. Its orbit has been calculated to have a high point of 716 miles and a low point of 155 miles, he said. `` It was launched early Monday Eastern Daylight Time and is in a near polar orbit,'' <PERSON> Gillies </PERSON> said. Defense officials at the Pentagon said they were unsure exactly what the satellite's payload included. `` But we're leaning toward more of an experimental communications package as opposed to a true spy satellite,'' said one source who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` This launch is impressive because it's a first, but I do n't think this particular satellite is going to offer much more ability to keep tabs on their neighbors,'' the source said <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> stressed that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders had given public assurances that their goal was `` peaceful purposes of space research and technological advancement.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the eighth nation to place a satellite into space. The country is generally believed to have nuclear capability.

 More than $ 1 million in federal grants have been earmarked for five rural health research centers that will provide information on a range of concerns about medical services. The awards were announced Monday by <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, at the first meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. The panel was created last June to advise <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and HHS. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said the economic diversity of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s towns and villages must be taken into account in considering ways of improving rural health care services. `` Twenty-eight percent of the rural counties in this country depend on manufacturing as a source of economic support; a surprising 21 percent have become retirement settlements; 13 percent depend on farming and 8 percent rely on oil and mining,'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Coopey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said that among the problems faced in trying to provide adequate health services in rural areas are: too few medical personnel, especially in obstetrics and gynecology; the closing of small hospitals; and the rising costs of malpractice insurance.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Canada Trade Pact But Future Uncertain in Ottawa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> welcomed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of a free-trade agreement with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as a prelude to a new surge of economic growth in both countries, but the accord's future is clouded by political conflict in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. `` It will benefit our people for generations to come,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Monday following 83-9 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of the agreement with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s top trading partner. `` The agreement will create jobs and stimulate economic growth on both sides of the border and create the largest open market in the world,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved not only the agreement signed Jan. 2 by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> but also a bill that would set the stage for the 10-year phaseout of tariffs called for under the pact. In <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, final approval of the agreement remains blocked by political wrangling. Plans to phase out tariffs have been passed by the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> but are bottled up in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where the controlling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> says action must await new parliamentary elections. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> is expected to call elections within a few weeks, and defeat for his <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could doom the agreement. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said little about the political wrangling north of the border. Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which largely shaped the legislation, said Canadian political disputes should be left to Canadians. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told reporters following the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action that it `` puts us one step closer to the culmination of a century-long dream on both sides of the border.'' On the roll call, 43 Democrats joined 40 Republicans in voting for the measure, which never had any partisan coloring, while seven Democrats and two Republicans opposed it. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the only country that currently has a free-trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But the volume is small compared with the $ 131 billion in goods a year that make <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> this country's top trading partner. There has been talk of free-trade agreements with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, No. 2 in volume of trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> But no such deals are on the horizon. Senators with home-state industries that might suffer under the Canadian agreement waged a largely symbolic rear guard fight against it. Some lawmakers from wheat producing states objected to a lingering Canadian subsidy for rail transportation of grain from <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> to the big eastern port at <LOCATION> Thunder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. Under the agreement, however, current subsidies for sending wheat to Vancouver would be dropped. Transportation costs represent a substantial portion of the price of grain and American wheat producers have complained that farmers north of the border will be able to undercut them because of the continued subsidies. American energy companies have complained that lower-priced Canadian products are likely to undercut them. And fearing that <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> publishers would overshadow <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s home-grown culture, Canadians also insisted on curbs affecting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural exports. Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, declared that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s potato subsidies combined with curbs on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> potato imports amounted to `` a dramatic ... double whammy that no American industry should be forced to endure.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> urged approval of the measure although he was gone from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by the time of the vote, as was <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. But the Texan in a morning speech acknowledged that `` this agreement is not all that it could have been.'' Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., said the measure `` clearly has weaknesses. `` But it is progress _ more progress than we have seen in some time,'' <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Voting against the measure were <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, D-Mont., <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, D-N.D.; <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky.; and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, Besides <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, those not voting were Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>; Chic Hecht, R-Nev.; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>,

<HEAD>Marilyn Quayle: Husband's Strong-Willed Adviser Campaigns on Her
Own</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has done `` 20 @ 20.'' Her husband <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, the Republican running for the country's No. 2 job, has not. He sometimes stumbles over his words. She never does. He can freeze when a reporter asks an unexpected question. She is always prepared, and the only frozen look is the one she icily bestows on an unfriendly questioner. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who is on her first solo national campaign swing this week, is considered one of the stronger assets of her husband's campaign. Her skills, said a senior campaign official, have `` been recognized'' and she has been asked to travel independently, hooking up with the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator for joint appearances one or two days each week. At 39, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a self-possessed woman whose flip hairdo and toothy smile evoke early <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. She is a mother of three and a lawyer, although she has n't practiced for some years. As a political wife, she's strong willed, fiercely protective and her husband's most trusted adviser. On the campaign trail, she can be warm and cordial, quick with a handshake for her husband's supporters or a hug for children at a day care center. But she also can be cold and withdrawn, especially around reporters. A practiced campaigner, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> nevertheless is unaccustomed to the <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan-like </PERSON> role she has played so far _ smiling pleasantly at her husband's side, applauding at the appropriate points. `` I've never sat listening to him give speeches and all of that. I always had my own schedule'' of campaigning, she said in a recent interview. She handles most situations with aplomb. When a precocious 4-year-old at a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> day care center commented on Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s slightly protruding teeth as `` a little buck,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> smiled and said cheerfully, `` Not many people notice that. She believes the press has given her husband `` the bad rap'' in coverage of controversies over his military service, academic record and personal life. She told <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20 @ 20'' program that the press was after her husband because he was so conservative She has n't changed that view. `` I have my opinion, which is reinforced by some studies that have been done on where the majority of the media is coming from. ... It's liberal,'' she said. She often pulls her husband away from reporters, touching his arm or patting him on the back if he begins to respond to impromptu questions. It is on such occasions, when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> talks extemporaneously, that he tends to misspeak or otherwise garble his words. But Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says she is `` not trying to protect him.'' `` He'd stand there and talk forever,'' she said. `` I'm trying to get him back on the plane.'' He is outgoing and affable. She seems more introspective, often aloof. But theirs appears to be a marriage more of similarities than differences. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> met in 1972 when both were attending night classes at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Ten weeks later they were married. They opened a law office together in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s hometown. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> worked until the birth of their second son. She is her husband's closest aide. At one news conference, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said his wife `` is my best adviser, my strongest supporter, the person that I love more than anybody else in this world.'' `` She is a very strong, independent-minded woman and she and I have a very close relationship,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says simply: `` I have a husband who has always valued my opinion and used me as an aide. ... Our basic fundamental values are the same. We have the same philosophy.'' She says she thus far achieved everything she has set out to do. For several years she has enjoyed oil painting. Eventually, she says, she may go back to work. Her children _ <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, 14, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, 11, and <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>, 9 _ all have ideas about what they want to be. She says she wants them to `` pick their goals and make them high enough that once they reach them or try to attain them, they do n't feel that they've shortchanged themselves. As for her own goals, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has n't picked out a pet project or special area she would like to concentrate on as a vice president's wife. `` I'm one of those people that have learned in politics you do n't plan anything until the election is over,'' she said.

<HEAD>Health Officials Say Care for Poor Women Is Inadequate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A panel of former and present Cabinet-level health officials agreed that care for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poor women and children is inadequate but disagreed on how to improve it. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, who served from 1958-61 as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, the forerunner to today's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needed a `` universal system of coverage'' to ensure adequate care. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary from 1983-85, agreed that health care services for the poor needed improvement. But Heckler, the current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, said, `` If it is based on the system in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, we do n't want that. I've seen it and many people are now asking to go to private physicians.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has a nationalized health care system. `` That's not what we're talking about,'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> countered. `` <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has got a government in power that has starved the system.'' The comments were made Monday at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to Prevent Infant Mortality, which is composed of HEW and <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretaries from the <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> through the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administrations. The group was asked to help find ways to make child health a national priority, but it issued no program for action. Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the commission created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, presented the problem in graphic terms `` Millions of children are forced to go without health care because they ca n't afford it or they ca n't find it,'' <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> said, noting that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> infant mortality rate in 1985 ranked 19th among all industrialized nations. `` This simply means that a child born in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> will have a better chance of reaching its first birthday than a child that is born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This means that nearly 40,000 babies every year in our country will be in a cemetery rather than in a nursery.'' Current <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> put the emphasis on what parents and local leaders can do, not on federal government involvement. `` Innocent babies are being crippled by AIDS, alcohol or drug abuse,'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said, adding that `` 50 to 60 percent of all health costs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are spent on preventable health problems.'' He urged prospective parents to make the necessary lifestyle changes to ensure their children's health and asked religious leaders to help the children make the proper lifestyle choices. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> also noted the actions business could take in providing proper child care and health services to working mothers, as well as contributions to medical research. `` This is a problem that people can do something about,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>, HEW secretary from 1975-77. `` For all our efforts to describe the problem, we give the impression that only if you are professional, if you're an expert, can you do something about the problem. And that's not true.'' Other panelists were <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary 1977-79; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HEW </ORGANIZATION> secretary 1969-1970; <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HEW </ORGANIZATION> secretary 1970-73; and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweiker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary 1981-83. Areas of agreement among panelists included: _ The health care delivery system does not match the population's _ Pregnant women can not get adequate health care _ For too many of those who need it, insurance is not available _ Too little is being spent on prevention of children's health problems _ There is a fragmentation of services which should be offered at central locations _ The federal government should take some responsibility in setting up above - standard day care

<HEAD>Japanese Industrialist Gives $1.5 Million to Art Gallery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Phillips Collection art gallery announced Monday it has received a $ 1.5 million donation, the largest since its founding, from Japanese industrialist <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Goh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> officials say they believe <PERSON> Goh </PERSON>'s donation is the largest and possibly the first significant gift from a Japanese citizen to an American museum. `` I like the <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, because it's comfortable, a unique sort of museum,'' said <PERSON> Goh </PERSON>, who has been visiting the gallery for about 40 years. <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> said he decided to make the contribution after being asked to join the gallery's board. National Gallery director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Freudenheim </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for museums, said such a large gift from a private Japanese citizen was `` unprecedented'' and asked for <PERSON> Goh </PERSON>'s address and telephone number. <PERSON> Goh </PERSON>'s wife is a member of the Ishibashi family, which founded a collection of French and Japanese impressionist and postimpressionist art in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> about the same time that <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> began his collection in the first quarter of this century. But <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> stressed that <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> gift comes from him, not the Ishibashi Foundation or the family's <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> tire company. The donation will go toward expansion of a wing of the gallery to be opened in May 1989 which now will be named the Goh annex.

 An explosion and fire ripped through an apartment building Monday, killing the owner and another man and injuring four others, authorities said. The owner, identified later as <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Conn </PERSON>, 56, was tinkering with a furnace or making some repairs when the blast hit, <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said.

Two men believed to have been working with the owner were critically injured, and authorities were not immediately able to get much information from them. The explosion may have been caused by natural gas that was building up when water in the basement snuffed a pilot light in an appliance, <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Some In Parliament Call For Letting Opposition Into Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The resignation of an entire Cabinet for the first time in postwar <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> raises the possibility that more non-communists _ even opposition figures _ will be brought into government, parliament deputies say. The Sejm, or parliament, voted 359-1 with 17 abstentions Monday to accept the resignation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> and all 19 ministers in his government, which had been sharply criticized for its handling of the economy. In free-wheeling debate that preceded the vote, one deputy suggested inviting opposition members into whatever governing team is named. Another urged reinstatement of the outlawed Solidarity free trade union movement. Inflation that has reached 60 percent helped provoke a wave of labor unrest in the spring and a second round of strikes last month that ended when communist authorities agreed to talks with the opposition that may include the issue of legalizing Solidarity. Scheduled for next month, the talks are to focus on the solving country's daunting economic and social problems. The current Cabinet is to remain in place until the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> names a new government, which it is expected to do later in the month. `` We are looking for someone who is competent, someone who has imagination and charisma,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, a member of the communist party's ruling Politburo and leader of the official trade union federation OPZZ. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the communist party holds ultimate power, appoints the government and mandates policy. <PERSON> Krystyna </PERSON> <PERSON> Jandy-Jendroska </PERSON>, chairwoman of a <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> committee that criticized the economic performance of <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>'s government, said in her report to parliament that more `` coalition forces'' from outside the party should be brought into government, including experts on the economy. Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- communist -RRB- Party deputy <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukasiewicz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> journalist, urged a system of `` socialist parliamentary democracy''. `` Different social groups, including the opposition, must assume participation within the authorities,'' he said. `` It would mean significant changes in the model of the party's leadership -LRB- and -RRB- working out a model of a ruling coalition.'' The comments appeared in line with statements from authorities in recent months that the government should broaden its base of support. Fifteen of the resigning government's 19 ministers are communists, two have no party affiliation, and there is one minister each from the communist-allied <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The topic of Solidarity and its chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> came up several times in the discussion that followed <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>'s announcement of the resignations Solidarity `` should regain its proper place in the trade union movement,'' said <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, an independent parliament member from <LOCATION> Lublin </LOCATION>. It was the first call in parliament for legalizing Solidarity since the movement was suppressed with a 1981 military crackdown. Addressing Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, `` the first Nobel Peace Prize laureate in Polish history,'' should meet and make a joint statement concerning <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s `` most vital interests.'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> smiled slightly but did not otherwise react. In all, about 30 deputies spoke, with several endorsing the planned broad-based talks that are to include the opposition. At least speaker suggested the government was being used as a whipping boy. `` The situation resembles a soccer game,'' said <PERSON> Tomasz </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamczuk </PERSON>, a Peasant Party member. `` The players are the political parties, the Polish trade union alliance, the opposition and others,'' he said. `` The ball is the government.''

 For five homeless years on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s mean streets, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he turned dozens of $ 5 tricks a day with other men to feed his crack habit, slept in a salt-filled warehouse and washed in a fire hydrant. `` I was selling my body for drugs. I was in a dead end zone,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said Monday. `` It was a scary life. You're on your own. Nobody's there to guide you. You do n't care where you sleep,'' he said. `` I could n't trust nobody I could n't trust myself.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who left home at age 15, is one of an estimated 10,000 homeless youths in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, an advocacy group founded 20 years to shelter and feed teen-agers who ran away or were abandoned by their parents. Children under 18 are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population, according to an estimate released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's the era of the disposable child,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keels </PERSON> of Covenant House. `` For them, it's a day-to-day struggle for survival, if you can call it that,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnwell </PERSON> of Covenant House. `` They sell their bodies to survive. They panhandle. They deaden themselves with drugs or alcohol.'' Each night, <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, founded by the Rev. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, dispenses two vans to round up homeless children and offer them beds, meals and clean clothes at a shelter. The van found <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> at a rat-infested, garbage-strewn warehouse where the city stockpiles salt for streets in winter. Homeless youths have built a shantytown of mattresses and crates, or they sleep in junked garbage trucks. `` They're brave kids,'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said. `` They're desperate to get back off the streets. Most of them wo n't make it.'' One who made it into the shelter was <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Uledi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, who lived for six months on the streets with his 16-year-old brother after they were abandoned. His parents were drug addicts who were evicted from their home and left without a word or trace, <PERSON> Uledi </PERSON> said. `` We robbed car radioes. We robbed cold cuts from supermarkets. We slept on roofs. Anything to get by,'' said the 5-foot-8, 130-pound Uledi, the pain evident in his blue eyes. `` You wonder where your next meal is coming from. It's hard out there in the streets. I want to forget it all,'' he said. Street kids are not included in the city's count of the homeless. As of Sept. 1, the city had 5,135 homeless families in system, including 10,799 children, according to the city's <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. They stay in a system of 39 hotels and 35 shelters. In some hotels, prostitutes turn tricks on stairwells. Crack is sold openly. Beatings occur every day. And a family of four may be crowded in a 9-by-12-foot room. `` There's nothing a kid does n't see in here,'' said <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Macklin </PERSON>, 31, who lived for four years in one of the city's welfare hotels. She sent her 11-year-old twin daughters to live in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> with their grandmother in 1987 after they saw a security guard shot dead in the Holland Hotel. `` These children live under the most extreme conditions of adversity of any child population in the developed world. They're the closest thing we have to refugees in the Third World,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Redlener </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> `` It's total depravation. They have been disconnected from a useful support system a civilized society tries to provide. We're going to pay a price for this,'' <PERSON> Redlener </PERSON> said <PERSON> Redlener </PERSON> treats 200 homeless children a week from two medical vans that are pediatric clinics on wheels. Half the patients lack immunization and many suffer from ear infections and asthma, <PERSON> Redlener </PERSON> said. `` It's a way of dying on the installment plan,'' said <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchenholz </PERSON> of the Association to Benefit Children, an advocacy group that runs a shelter for children. `` Their life is so harsh. They lose their childhood, the magic that belongs to being a child. It's very sad to see a child lose that resilience. We're doing irreparable harm,'' she said. `` We're killing a generation of very poor kids,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, founder of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coalition for the Homeless. `` It's an abandonment of the most fragile people to the most devastating of environments.''

<TEXT>
 Two rescue-swimmer instructors testified under immunity Monday, backing up the story of a sailor standing court-martial in the drowning of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recruit during a training exercise. The defense rested later Monday, and the trial was recessed until Thursday when closing arguments will be made by lawyers on both sides. The military judge, Cmdr. <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krogmann </PERSON>, planned to meet Tuesday with lawyers to work on instructions for the panel of five officers hearing the case. One panel member asked for an additional day's delay because Wednesday is Yom Kippur, a Jewish holiday, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, has denied he helped push Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> back into a swimming pool March 2 after <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> panicked and climbed out. He also testified that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, from <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, completed a lifesaving maneuver, in which he freed himself from a head hold applied by <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, just seconds before collapsing in the pool at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has accused <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> of forcing <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s head under water and charged him with involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> was in the pool at the time other instructors pried <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> away from an equipment rack and `` dropped him back in the water,'' testified Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said he and now-retired Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who testified Friday, were joined by two other instructors, whose identity he was unable to remember, in pushing <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> into the pool. <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said he did n't see what happened after <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was tossed back in the pool because he went into the lockerroom. But Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelenock </PERSON> was close by and supported <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>'s contention that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> completed the escape and put <ORGANIZATION> Combe </ORGANIZATION> in a cross-chest carry. `` I really felt good about it overall because I figured his -LRB- <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s -RRB- confidence level was boosted 100 percent,'' <PERSON> Zelenock </PERSON> said. Between the time <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was returned to the pool and his drowning, the recruit had grabbed a rope dividing the pool. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> admitted last week he dunked <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> for three seconds to get him to drop his grip. <PERSON> Zelenock </PERSON> testified that while at the rope with <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, the recruit said, `` I ca n't do it. I ca n't do it. I ca n't. I ca n't.'' `` I asked, did he want want to be here? And he definitely said ` yes' to me.'' At that point, <PERSON> Zelenock </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> to get on with the procedure or get out of the pool, and the recruit stayed in.

 A high school made famous by <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> has banned gold chains, designer sunglasses or other expensive status symbols to prevent an expensive competition students ca n't afford, the principal says. `` I see and hear about the youngsters being shot over gold chains as they walk to and from school,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mumford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principal </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oden </PERSON> said. `` My kids -LRB- students -RRB- have been harassed. Recognizing that, I want to make sure that it does n't spill over into the school. The dress code established this school year also bans tank tops, jogging suits, snakeskin-adorned gym shoes and like finery at the 2,500-student, inner-city school, which gained fame through T-shirts <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> wore in the film `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop.'' A student who violates the code gets a written notice, which is sent to his or her parents. Repeat offenses can result in a three-to five-day suspension. <PERSON> Oden </PERSON> said a 14-year-old student told him last year that she had heard a dress code was being considered and that she hoped one would be adopted. `` She said she could n't afford to purchase expensive things and felt bad when she could n't compete with her peers,'' the principal said. `` That troubled me, so I talked to other students and found out they felt the same way.'' Rivalry involving expensive clothing has sometimes turned violent. Two 17-year-old boys were wounded by gunfire last year after one was robbed of a blue sheepskin jacket. Three years ago, a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> retailer threatened to discontinue a brand of gym shoes when a 13-year-old was shot in the chest after giving his gym shoes to five youths who demanded them. On a recent afternoon, some students were spotted near <LOCATION> Mumford </LOCATION> High wearing gold or other expensive jewelry and other banned items. They said they stashed it at school during the day, then wore it home. <PERSON> Oden </PERSON> said a student who did the same thing was assaulted by two boys who robbed her of two gold chains. He said he told other students of the incident at an assembly. <PERSON> Oden </PERSON> said he is encouraged by the students following the code. `` I invite you to stand out in the hall and I dare you to find any gold jewelry,'' he said. `` We've had to deal with some students, but we have not had any suspensions to this day. About 98 percent of my students adhere to the dress code to the letter.''

<HEAD>Board Approves Policy To Let Patients Veto Care By AIDS Carriers</HEAD>

 Despite criticism from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the county board voted Monday to give patients at <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> the right to refuse treatment from health care workers who are carriers of the AIDS virus. The hospital would become the first in the country to adopt such a policy. Hospital officials said they have not yet developed a way to implement it, however. The county board, which also serves as the hospital's board of directors, voted 15-2 to adopt the policy. Approval was expected, after the policy was adopted by the board's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week. The policy covers all hospital workers who `` routinely provide direct patient care'' including doctors and nurses. But medical and hospital associations have called it misguided. `` Our reaction is one of dismay,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bistow </PERSON>, speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>, after the committee vote last week. `` There has been no case in this country of a patient contracting the AIDS virus from a health-care worker.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, stumping across Republican strongholds in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, is skewering <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> liberal out of sync with voters on a host of issues from gun control to taxes to defense. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> today was visiting an irrigation project at a nearby diversion dam, then holding a rally on the steps of the state capital before flying on to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>.

He claimed that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants to disarm everyone except the police and military, and said that while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` brags about being a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> belongs to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He also criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for opposing the death penalty under any circumstances, and said that he let killers out of jail on `` weekend junkets'' in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Casper </PERSON>, he charged that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was driving citizens away from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> with high taxes and spending _ higher spending per capita than any other state. `` That's not what you want to rank first in,'' he said. He charged that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` did not create an economic miracle in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. He created an economic manacle.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> ranks 40th out of 50 states in total employment growth and 45th in manufacturing job growth. It actually lost 90,000 manufacturing jobs between June 1984 and January 1988, he said. Former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. and White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, said after the boisterous rally, `` He handled it well. That's the real test of a politician. The hecklers were few, but they were noisy. He did n't get angry ... He made his speech and cast one missile at them and it took. The crowd was with him.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> conceded that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has a low unemployment rate, but said that is because `` people are leaving <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` raised virtually every tax in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>'' and opposed a statewide proposition that limited tax increases. When taxes were cut, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, the credit belonged to the legislature, not the governor.

<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, at 87 the world's longest reigning monarch, received a blood transfusion after vomiting blood and was in stable condition at the Imperial Palace on Tuesday, palace officials and news reports said. But the respected <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news agency, citing unidentified `` government sources,'' said at midday that the emperor appeared to be in critical condition. Officials would not confirm the report. The government decided Tuesday to place Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, 54, the emperor's eldest son, in charge of all matters of state until the emperor recovers, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Kichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tazawa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tazawa </PERSON> told reporters after a regular Cabinet meeting that the Cabinet was expected to formally approve the appointment Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said the government was considering whether to advise <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members to remain at their offices and not leave <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The emperor's death would plunge <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> into official mourning, for which there would be no modern precedent. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has been on the throne since 1926, and older Japanese who grew up when he was considered divine revere him greatly. Those born after World War II tend to have less interest in the emperor, who renounced his divinity after the war. Court physicians were summoned to the palace in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> after the emperor vomited blood shortly before 10 p.m. -LRB- 9 a.m. EDT -RRB- Monday and they gave him a blood transfusion for four hours beginning at 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, the imperial official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The doctors ruled out hospitalizing the aged emperor. Television and news service reports said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> received 1.7 pints of blood during the transfusion and was fully conscious during the treatment. Following the transfusion, the emperor's temperature fell to about 98.6 degrees and his pulse was a normal 90 beats per minute, according to the imperial official. After two consecutive days of fever, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s condition grew worse late Monday. Imperial officials said court phsycians found traces of jaundice in his blood and would perform minor surgery if the fever continued. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> suffered a 100.4 degree fever Sunday. Almost one year ago on Sept. 22, the emperor underwent an intestinal operation, and doctors found a hard, egg-size enlargement of the pancreas, which blocked the duodenum. Surgeons did not remove the blockage but performed a bypass around it. In recent weeks the emperor has suffered a cold, according to the imperial agency, and news reports last week said he has lost 20 pounds from his weight of 130 pounds before his surgery last year. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has held since Christmas Day 1926, and Crown Princess <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> came to the palace Tuesday morning. Nationally broadcast television reports showed limousines bearing members of the imperial family arriving at the palace to pay their respects. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> visited early Tuesday to sign his name on a list of well-wishers, according to television reports.

<TEXT>
 `` A Fish Called Wanda'' lured enough moviegoers last weekend to bag first place in the nation's box office rankings, which was weakened by the Olympics and bad weather. `` Wanda,'' a comedy starring <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, earned $ 2.55 million, according to figures provided by Exhibitor Relations Co. It was the comedy's first time in the top slot after 10 weeks of release. But the overall box-office take was down for the weekend. By comparison, `` Moon Over Parador,'' took in $ 3.2 million for first place the previous weekend. `` Between the Olympics and the ball games, both college and professional, and the normal letdown for this time of year, box office suffered,'' said Exhibitor Relations chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krier </PERSON>. `` Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and cold weather in some areas were also factors.'' In second place was `` Die Hard'' with $ 2.54 million, followed by `` Moon Over Parador,'' which sold $ 2.45 million in tickets. `` Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,'' earned $ 2.2 million for fourth place. Disney's `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' earned $ 2.08 million, edging `` Betrayed,'' with $ 2.07 million, for fifth and sixth place, respectively. In another close-ranking, `` Young Guns'' drew $ 1.9 million for seventh place, and `` Cocktail'' stirred up $ 1.8 million in ticket sales for eighth spot. Ninth was `` Married To The Mob'' with $ 1.39 million, and the <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> comedy `` Coming To <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' re-entered the top 10 with $ 1.30 million for 10th place. Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in release. 1. `` A Fish Called Wanda,'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2.55 million, 1,207 screens, $ 2,117 per screen, $ 45.1 million, 10 weeks. 2. `` Die Hard,'' 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, $ 2.54 million, 1,371 screens, $ 1,853 per screen, $ 65.3 million, 10 weeks. 3. `` Moon Over Parador,'' Universal, $ 2.45 million, 1,143 screens, $ 2,145 per screen, $ 6.6 million, two weeks. 4. `` Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,'' New Line, $ 2.2 million, 1,465 screens, $ 1,516 per screen, $ 41.3 million, five weeks. 5. `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>,'' Disney, $ 2.08 million, 1,393 screens, $ 1,498 per screen, $ 135.9 million, 13 weeks. 6. `` Betrayed,'' MGM, $ 2.07 million, 1,101 screens, $ 1,882 per screen, $ 19.6 million, four weeks. 7. `` Young Guns,'' 20th <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.9 million, 1,358 screens, $ 1,443 per screen, $ 34.7 million, six weeks. 8. `` Cocktail,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.8 million, 1,364 screens, $ 1,379 per screen, $ 63 million, eight weeks. 9. `` Married To The Mob,'' <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.39 million, 827 screens, $ 1,691 per screen, $ 16.2 million, five weeks. 10. `` Coming To <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' Paramount, $ 1.30 million, 830 screens, $ 1,571 per screen, $ 121 million, 12 weeks.

<HEAD>Few in Poll Believe Candidates Can Deliver</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For all the grand designs of the presidential nominees, a large number of Americans believe neither candidate could deliver on most of his campaign promises, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found. About half the 1,125 adults in the national survey saw both men as strong leaders, with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rated by more as compassionate and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rated by more as competent to manage the federal government. But just 36 percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could accomplish most of his stated goals in office, and only 31 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could do most of what he wants. Nearly half said either would be stymied in office; the rest were unsure. Seven in 10 respondents agreed nonetheless that the outcome of the election will have a major impact on the nation's future. But they were divided evenly, 45-45, on whether the election will affect them personally. Results of the poll, conducted the week after Labor Day, underscored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s success since the Republican Convention at controlling the campaign agenda. Fifty-two percent said he had clear positions on the issues, while just 37 percent said the same of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The results were released Monday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also was perceived as the better government manager, 50-34, despite <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' claim to the issue. And 77 percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> understands the complex problems a president faces, while only 44 percent said that of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won overwhelming endorsement as better able to maintain a strong defense, chosen over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 67 percent 15 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was narrowly seen as more likely to cut the federal deficit, 38-30. In a measure that bodes well for an incumbent party, six in 10 said they were better off now than they were four years ago or eight years ago, and 55 percent expected their family finances to improve in the next few years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had mixed success in his effort to paint <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as more likely to raise taxes: A plurality, 45 percent, said there was n't likely to be any difference between the two when it comes to that issue <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was rated higher than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on some personal issues. Sixty-two percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cares about people like them, while 50 percent said that of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Forty-two percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sometimes talks carelessly, without considering the consequences; just 30 percent said that of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The two were about equal in some other ratings: Six in 10 said both offer a vision of where they want to lead the country and five in 10 said both were strong leaders. Six in 10 said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have good judgment under pressure and five in 10 said that of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was rated as better for the rich and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as better for the poor, but respondents were split on which would do more for the middle class. They were nearly split on which candidate would do more to improve education, with 39 percent choosing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 33 percent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led solidly among respondents who said they plan to vote and had definitely made a choice, partly because a greater share of Republicans said they had decided. The gauge is a different one than in other national polls. Fifty-seven percent said they planned to vote and had made a definite choice; they favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 56-39. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led, 48-42, in a late June-early July poll, indicating that even opinions expressed as firm are movable. The poll found a three-way split in ideology, with about a third each calling themselves Republicans, Democrats and independents. Other recent polls had similar results, a departure from the longtime Democratic lead in this measure. The Media General-AP poll was conducted the week after Labor Day, Sept. 6-14, among a random sample of adults nationwide. It had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points for all respondents, four points for those who said they planned to vote and had chosen a candidate. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Aides to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, incensed by what one called <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s misleading `` statistical hit-and-run,'' are organizing Democratic surrogates to respond more aggressively to the vice president's attacks, which in recent days have focused on the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> economy. That strategy was evident Monday when, within hours of a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speech, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign called on eight business leaders to meet with reporters to rebut <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s characterization of the Democratic nominee as an anti-business governor. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advisers, frustrated by what they contend has been far too little scrutiny of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks, promised similar events in the future. The latest salvos have particularly angered the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp because they center on the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> economy _ the backbone of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> candidacy. `` Our view is that a candidate has an obligation to tell the truth to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, a senior <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> adviser. `` But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has played fast and loose with the facts last week and he's doing it again this week. It's what we call statistical hit-and-run.'' Last week <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> charged that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> taxpayers had suffered under <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and that the state was $ 7.4 billion in debt, a figure the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign cited to assert that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> since 1983 had amassed more debt than all the governors `` from the Pilgrims to <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>,'' his predecessor. The figures he cited to support the increased tax burden indeed showed that per-capita taxes increased in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> from 1983 to 1987 but failed to factor in record growth of personal income in the state during that period. Taxes were cut in those years _ mostly over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' objections _ but the average <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> resident pays more taxes because he or she is earning more money. And while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is authorized to issue bonds totaling $ 7.4 billion, the state's current bonded indebtedness is $ 3.9 million _ lower in inflation-adjusted dollars than the debt <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> inherited from King. `` The bottom line is that in taxes, across the board, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> citizens pay more than they did several years ago,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>. `` We're not going to back down one iota.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued his assault Monday, telling a <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> luncheon in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had an `` anti-business scheme'' and that the number of business bankruptcies in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> was up 23.7 percent during the first six months of the year while the national rate had fallen 23.5 percent. <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said the figures came from the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides said they had not seen those figures but again accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of misrepresentation _ citing figures showing business failures in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> had declined by 28 percent since <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> became governor in 1983, and that they had occurred at less than half the national rate during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency. `` We're running against a guy who kicked off his campaign in <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, referring to a Labor Day appearance there by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` He has Goofy as his economist or something and is throwing out daffy statistics. This is the kind of opponent we have and expected and we are prepared to run against.'' <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, citing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s appearance on a weekend news program to support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' views on defense and foreign policy, said leading members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would be called on to rebut some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> charges while <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> business and industry leaders would address <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> comments about the state economy. `` My company has grown and prospered under the leadership of Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter, told the Monday briefing. `` He created the atmosphere that made it possible for us to grow.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will respond as well when he sees fit, said <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, who with other <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides encouraged increased media scrutiny of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statements. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a record of being wrong,'' <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. `` Not only are we on notice but the press is on notice. He has consistently misrepresented the facts and not been accurate.'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> rejected that characterization as `` nonsense.'' `` I think the big lie is that they are making <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> out to be some sort of economic miracle,'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s new Trident 2 submarine missile has suffered a second failure in its last three test firings, its wreckage tumbling into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> after it went astray and was deliberately blown up. The $ 23.7 million missile blasted off a land launch pad Monday and appeared to be accelerating smoothly across a clear sky when it suddenly exploded several miles above the ocean. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reported that the Trident 2 had developed a problem in the second stage about 60 seconds after liftoff, and when it veered off course, the range safety officer sent a radio signal to ignite explosive packages in the vehicle. The failure was the third in 15 test firings for the missile being groomed as the most powerful in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear arsenal. But two of the last three have been destroyed by the range safety officer. The 44-foot, three-stage missile has nearly 6,000-mile range, but the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> declined to disclose how far the unarmed warhead package was to have traveled Monday. Five more land pad launches are scheduled here, to be followed by at least five test launches from submerged submarines. It was not known if the latest failure would have an impact on the test schedule. The weapons is scheduled to be deployed late next year. Each Trident 2 is designed to hurl up to 10 nuclear warheads to different targets. There will be 24 of the missiles in each Trident submarine.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> opens its 43rd General Assembly with enhanced prestige due to the Iran-Iraq truce and Afghan accords, a reputation that may tarnish once debate begins. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> wryly observed that the world body, convening today, has high expectations to live up to. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is treated as an angel, then we must remember that the halo that slips 10 inches is a noose,'' he said at a luncheon of the U.N. Correspondents Association on Monday. The session opens with the election of the president of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> after a behind-the-scenes fight that has revived some lingering enmity from the 1982 <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> War between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has campaigned hard against <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Nita </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>, who <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has backed. Diplomatic sources said the race was too close to call, and there could be several secret ballots before one candidate wins a simple majority of the assembly's 159 voting member states. The outgoing president is <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Florin </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>.

But the general debate that begins Monday may generate more heat than light. One fight is expected over a proposed address by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on the 40th anniversary of its founding. Both it and communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have non-voting observer status and can not speak before the assembly without an invitation.

On Monday, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is to deliver his final speech to the world body, which his administration has criticized over the years for bureaucracy, waste and an anti-Western bias.

 Strong winds late Monday fanned an arson fire over a containment line and into the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION>, forcing 500 people to flee, but cool, damp weather helped firefighters battle blazes in the Northwest. The sheriff's department ordered the evacuation from home in rural <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION>, but most complied voluntarily, said <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>. The fire, which has destroyed nine homes and charred more than 17,000 acres of brush, is the larger of two major <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> blazes. The other destroyed six homes as it roared across about 8,000 acres of wildland, brush and timber near <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>. At the fire in Redding near <LOCATION> Shasta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, two men clearing burned timber were seriously injured Monday when a tree fell on them, forestry officials said. Both men, suffering head and back injuries, were hospitalized in critical condition, officials said. Fifteen fires still burning Monday had charred 1.39 million acres in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. In all this season, 69,099 fires have blackened 4,140,000 acres, including about 2 million acres in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, he said. The dwindling number of civilian and military firefighters in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> worked Monday to deepen fire lines around fires that have burned 1.1 million acres of the 2.2 million-acre park. Officials said they can now reduce the number of firefighters in the park, which once totaled more than 8,000. About 550 soldiers returned to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, on Sunday after four weeks, and two battalions were preparing to leave. In addition, officials had started releasing employees of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, said fire information officer <PERSON> Marv </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>. `` There are no real hot fires out there,'' he said. `` If there were, we'd keep the agency people for their experience. There's nothing very exciting out there today. The Miller fire that destroyed nine homes near <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION>, 55 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, was 50 percent contained Monday. But estimates that the fire would be controlled by Wednesday morning had to be abandoned when the fire jumped a road Monday and forced the closure of another, said <PERSON> Alleah </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, a state forestry spokeswoman. Control of the 8,000-acre <PERSON> Fern </PERSON> fire that destroyed six homes near <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was predicted for Tuesday evening, said <ORGANIZATION> CDF </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Sharon Wages. Officials said about 5,500 firefighters remained in and around <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> on Monday, including about 4,000 Army soldiers and <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said. `` Until the fires are out, there is still some potential threat,'' said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. `` Primarily, the crews are doing mop-up on existing fire lines, working back into the fire and creating a bigger break.'' Fire experts were optimistic that recent frosty days in the park may have spelled the end of burning conditions such as those that allowed blazes to race across miles in hours. `` I would be surprised if the fires made any more major runs,'' said fire behavior analyst <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Freet </PERSON>. `` I think we're into a cooling, moist trend. I wo n't say wet, but this might be enough to hold it where it's at right now.'' Crews also were being reduced at fires remaining in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, and outdoor fire restrictions were lifted in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and in part of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Officials in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> said about 940 firefighters remained at the 35,400-acre Red Bench fire in Glacier Park and in west-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> just three 20-member crews monitor the smoldering 247,000-acre Canyon Creek fire. `` It's all due to the fact that we've gotten a lot of rain up here, and looking at the forecast we're going to get more,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>.

 Average SAT scores were virtually unchanged for the fourth straight year, but that wo n't stop educators and interest groups from quarreling about the significance of those numbers. Scores on the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test fell two points, to an average 428, while the national average on the math section was unchanged at 476, according to the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s annual report released Monday. Both portions of the multiple-choice exam taken each year by 1.1 million college-bound students are scored on a scale of 200-800, with a combined 1600 being perfect. The combined math-verbal average of 904 marked the first decline in eight years, and followed three years of no change at 906. Minority students, however, continued a decade-long pattern of impressive gains. National averages on the ACT, the predominant college entrance exam in 28 states mostly in the West and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, also were little changed. The approximately 1 million students who took the ACT last school year averaged 18.8 on a scale of 1-36, up slightly from the 18.7 average the year before, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> Testing Program, the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Iowa-based organization that administers the test. The College Board painted the `` stability'' of test scores as good news of a sort. Board president <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said scores are holding up well despite a 13 percent increase in the number of test-takers in the last two years alone. More test-takers usually bring down the averages. But to a nation that's heard much talk for five years from politicians and educators about how reform would transform school life, the latest SAT news was bound to be disappointing. In a statement Monday, Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> blamed the school establishment for the falloff in scores: `` No medals for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in this news. I said in April that ` the absolute level at which our improvements are taking place is unacceptably low.' Today it's a bit lower, and still not acceptable. C'mon, team! Back into training.'' Added <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>: `` We are always disappointed when the scores do n't improve each year, because secondary schools are more rigorous than they were five years ago. `` If the impact does n't show in the next year or two, then we really have to go back and seriously reexamine the problems,'' <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said. The flat SAT scores may, in fact, be evidence of what <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> and others have said recently: that reform has only nipped at the margins of classroom life in all but a few school districts. For most children, nothing much has changed. `` There's no question that graduation requirements have changed. Students are taking more math and other academic subjects than five years ago,'' said <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>. `` But has reform changed the way teachers instruct in class? Has there been a profound change in student learning? The answer is no.'' Apart from the national averages, the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> released numbers showing how blacks and other minorities compared with whites, males with females, and states with each other _ enough statistical grist for a year's worth of arguments among school critics and advocates. Black students in the class of'88 averaged 353 on the verbal portion, up two points, and math scores rose seven points to 384 _ especially heartening since the number of black test-takers rose 39 percent in three years from 70,156 in 1985 to 97,483 last year. Scores by blacks have risen 51 points since 1976, as the scores of all test-takers gained only one point. But the gulf between blacks and whites remains 198 points. And recent gains have not stilled standardized test critics who accuse the SAT of cultural and racial bias. Nonetheless, higher SATs by minority students provide arguments for those in favor of continuing and expanding Head Start and other federal education programs started in the 1960s and 1970s that the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and others now credit with helping boost scores in the 1980s. A more subtle issue is the persistent gap between males and females. Males scored an average 498 math and 435 verbal; females scored 455 math, 422 verbal. Test critics including <LOCATION> FairTest </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, have charged that the SAT is biased against women in its wording and content. <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials deny that and offer figures showing that females take less demanding studies. The board said that 59 percent of female test-takers took four years of math, compared with 68 percent of males. And while 43 percent of males had four years of natural science study, only 32 percent of females did.

<HEAD>Fireworks Factory Blast Kills Five</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An explosion in a private fireworks factory killed five people, including the owners and their 12-year-old son, and injured nine, a newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported today The Guangming Daily said the Aug. 23 blast was triggered when the 12-year-old, who worked at the factory, mishandled fuses. He and the four other victims died in the hospital. The paper did not explain the delay in reporting the accident, the second fireworks explosion in fourth months in coastal <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> province's <LOCATION> Congnan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. In June, an explosion at another factory injured 15 workers, including 13 children. Safety standards generally are low in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s more than 90,000 small-scale private and township-run fireworks factories, and accidents are common. The most recent government statistic says 644 fireworks factory employees were killed in accidents in 1986. Eighteen people died last December in a nearby <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> province factory where untrained workers were instructed to cut the fireworks' fuses by hand. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has begun drafting workplace safety regulations but enforcement is lax.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will step forward to take questions in their first presidential debate Sunday, but it remains unclear who will be asking those questions. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic hopeful, proposed Monday that the four commercial television network news anchormen be the moderator and panelists, sources familiar with the negotiations said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate, had his own list of four possible peacekeepers and 10 questioners from both electronic and print journalism. By late Monday, the question of questioners was still being debated by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides as the Sunday date for the face-off at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> drew closer. The last-minute sparring is typical of presidential campaigns, complete with accusations that the other side is breaking their agreement not to talk about any of the arrangements. The first debate is sponsored by the parties' commission on debates. The second presidential debate, due Oct. 13 or Oct. 15 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, is sponsored by the League of Women Voters. This most recent volley between the campaigns erupted Monday, when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to propose the four-anchor idea for all three debates. Sources who spoke only on the condition they not be identified said <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> suggested that the anchors from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the Cable News Network be the moderators and questioners during both presidential debates and the vice president debate scheduled Oct. 5 in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>. That would mean CBS's <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and probably <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> would be on stage for all three events. And contacts were made with the news organizations to see if they would agree, one source said. ` This is a television event,'' said one <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide of the idea. `` We want to do what we can to make it an event that people will pay attention to. We think that they anchors would make it a bigger event ... More people would watch it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides flatly rejected the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> idea of all the presidential debates as well as the vice presidential one. The idea is `` blatantly unfair to the print media and other television correspondents,'' said one <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide. But a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide said that their proposal was still on the table, despite the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's stance. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> source said the campaign responded later Monday with a list of four proposed moderators and 10 panelists. The source would not name any of them, saying only the list was made up of network anchors, network correspondents and print representatives. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> source also accused the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign of violating the agreement not to talk about such matters. `` We are operating under a written agreement of understanding not to discuss the negotiations surrounding'' debate details, said the aide. `` Obviously that has been violated,'' and thus the source gave the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign position on the matters. While pre-debate squabbling is normal, the difference this year is there is no third party _ such as the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> _ as the moderator of the pre-debate debate. The two political parties tried to wrest the debate sponsorship away from the league with the formation of the bipartisan debate commission. But the league _ which has sponsored debates in the past three presidential campaigns _ kept fighting for a role. When the two campaigns agreed to split sponsorship of the debates, that left them to deal more directly with each other on these pre-debate matters than in the past.

<HEAD>Flood Survivors Try To Salvage What They Can</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Scores of people returned to salvage possessions from the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catarina </LOCATION> riverbed, where a flash flood spawned by Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> devastated their homes, but most came up empty. People lined the banks Monday, digging with their hands in the muck. What was for decades a dry riverbed with thousands of homes had become a mangled landscape of twisted metal and crumbled concrete. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, her husband and their six children, had lived on the riverbed in a two-room home made of concrete blocks and tin. Their clothing, furniture and new school books were washed away. `` We went yesterday to see it, but there was n't a thing to save,'' Ms. <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> said as she washed her 10-month-old son's diapers in a bucket of water. `` Even the blocks were gone. Now where do we go?'' she asked. More than 100 people were killed in the sudden, storm-whipped rebirth Saturday of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catarina </LOCATION>, which became a savage torrent 10 feet deep and 450 feet wide as Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> dumped 12 inches of rain on the city. `` We just got three blankets out and lost everything else,'' said <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrizales </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, sitting outside a shelter for the homeless. Mrs. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> was among thousands of people who had built meager homes in the riverbed that cuts through this industrial city in northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s most populated region. The riverbed suddenly swelled with water, sweeping away entire ramshackle communities, miles of roads and a sprawling sports complex with miles of tennis and basketball courts, soccer and baseball fields and jogging tracks. Four buses and other vehicles were dragged into the torrent. The bus passengers are presumed to comprise most of the 100 people confirmed dead. The Nuevo Leon state government said a `` considerable number'' of people were missing and 30,000 people were lodged in shelters around the state. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapa </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro-Garza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garcia </LOCATION>, the suburb of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> hit hardest by the disaster, said Monday that his first priority is to find better lodgings for the 7,000 homeless people in his community. He said those people with homes on the riverbed that escaped ruin would be allowed to return there only provisionally. `` We're asking for a place to put them,'' <PERSON> Chapa </PERSON> said. `` Houses can be built pretty fast, but not in a month.''

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews Sept. 6-14 with 1,125 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The phone numbers were selected randomly by computer, and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be within three points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ four points, for example, for those who said they planned to vote and had decided on a candidate. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and responses in this poll; because of rounding, some totals may exceed 100: 1. Do you plan to vote in this year's presidential election, or not? Yes: 85 percent.

<HEAD>Army Scraps High-Level Biological Warfare Lab</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERN ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOOELE ARMY DEPOT, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to scrap plans for a high-level biological warfare test lab in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> has drawn praise from state officials, but an environmentalist says residents still ca n't rest easy. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it will no longer seek approval for the lab designed for experiments with genetically altered microbes or deadly micro-organisms for which there are no known antidotes. Instead, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials said, they will downgrade the proposed `` biosafety level 4'' laboratory at Dugway Proving Ground to a new $ 5.3 million level-3 lab where scientists can experiment with biological agents for which there are vaccines or cures. `` The people of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> are still at more risk,'' said <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> of the Foundation on Economic Trends in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` It's easier for viruses to get out of this facility than the one they proposed. The chance of a micro-organism escaping is low. But if one does escape, it could be catastrophic.'' <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said his organization, which brought legal action forcing the Army to conduct a more extensive environmental assessment of the proposed lab, would seek another injunction if the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> went ahead with its plans without a new environmental impact study. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy assistant secretary for installations and logistics, said the level-3 lab would be used for tests of materials and defenses against biological attack similar to those conducted at Dugway since the early 1950s in a lab that now is outdated. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s decision is based on an extensive evaluation of the requirements for biological defense,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. `` Existing Army BL4 facilities will be used to satisfy any future needs for material testing that requires a containment level higher than BL3.'' The Army's original draft environmental statement, published in February, said the higher-level lab would be used only for level-3 experiments, but it did not rule out experiments with more exotic and deadly agents in the future. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said the final environmental impact statement due next spring would identify the level-3 lab as `` the preferred alternative for construction.'' The draft document had listed it only as a possible alternative, concluding a level-4 lab would be safer. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation and Republican Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> praised the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. In March, <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> had vowed to block construction of a higher-level lab, including withholding state construction permits, and later met with <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials to seek a compromise. `` I appreciate the Army's new-found willingness to compromise with the people of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and negotiate with me as governor on matters which affect the state and its citizens,'' <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> said. The governor said he would announce within days the composition of a civilian-scientist oversight committee to monitor testing at the desert outpost 70 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` I will insist the open process continue and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> shares with the people in the state information regarding what testing is being performed in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> said. During a public comment period that ended Aug. 2, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> received 107 comments, 103 of which opposed building the facility. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said the outcry over the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s initial plan was `` not the sole determining factor in the decision,'' but he added, `` we try to be good neighbors.'' `` There was never a decision to back down or away from, as such,'' he said. `` We did not have a decision prior to now.'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said there are five higher-level containment labs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> could conduct such tests, if needed, including its own lab at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Detrick </LOCATION>, Md. On Monday night, 100 people attended an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> hearing at <ORGANIZATION> Tooele </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> on the draft environmental impact statement governing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s biological defense research program. The document concluded that the program `` does not create significant adverse impacts on the quality of the environment'' and perceived risks are `` very much exaggerated.'' It also rejected the idea of a non-military management of the testing program, saying it would not mute controversies relating to such issues as genetic engineering, highly infectious organisms or aerosol testing. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abandoned research into offensive biological weapons in 1969 and later signed a treaty banning their use or possession. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> continues to conduct research into defensive measures against biological warfare, such as masks and vaccines.

 Crews repairing a dam accidentally killed thousands of fish by reducing the flow into the <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and anglers here for the fishing season are being assaulted by the stench of rotting salmon and trout. `` I did n't know what to think. Everywhere you walked there was dead fish,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Trevose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, one of the thousands of fishermen who come to this <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> city each fall. The fish were killed Wednesday when a <ORGANIZATION> Niagara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mohawk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> crew decided to do some work on a dam, and reduced the flow of water in the river, officials said. That left thousands of big fish, about 3 feet long and 20-30 pounds, stranded in shallow pools or flopping on rocks. `` They -LRB- the utility -RRB- could not have picked a worse time to do this,'' <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Creech </PERSON>, regional fisheries manager for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. `` I would say a substantial portion of the fall salmon run has been wiped out.'' Each fall, from Labor Day to mid-October, Chinook and Coho salmon and rainbow and brown trout swim out of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> and up the <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to spawn. Unless they're caught, they die shortly after laying their eggs in the river. <PERSON> Creech </PERSON> said he believes the fish kill will be a major blow for the area, which takes in an estimated $ 150 million from fishing each year. For the first weekend alone, from Sept. 10-11, 2,500 anglers showed up. `` The season continues into October,'' <PERSON> Creech </PERSON> said from his office in <LOCATION> Cortland </LOCATION>. `` Do n't you think that some guy who hears about this is going to go somewhere else or do something else?'' <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciurleo </PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION> Bare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Tackle Shop up the road from the fish kill, said it's too early to tell what kind of effect it will have on business. `` All I know is that there's 3,000 fish or whatever that nobody's going to catch and that's got to have some kind of impact,'' <PERSON> Ciurleo </PERSON> said. The utility agreed to start cleaning up the rotting fish today, said <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mohawk </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said the utility had been trying to install wooden structures on top of <ORGANIZATION> Varick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dam </ORGANIZATION>, one of six on the <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION>, to better control water flow over the dam. In doing the work, crews allowed the part of the river in front of the dam to drain, <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said. Many of the discolored fish washed into the <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION>, surrounding expensive yachts and floating under the docks. `` It's a travesty,'' said <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> <PERSON> Raate </PERSON>, a charter boat operator at the marina. `` This is going to prove to be an economic disaster for the city. `` It smells like a sewer. You're not going to want to fish or use your boat with that kind of stink,'' <PERSON> Raate </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapaport </PERSON>, a spokesman for Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, said he did n't think it was fair to characterize the dead fish as a major blow to <PERSON> Oswego </PERSON>'s tourism. `` You should have been here yesterday when we had fishermen shoulder-to-shoulder pulling up live fighting salmon out of the river,'' <PERSON> Rapaport </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think we'll suffer any economic hardship.''

<TEXT>
 Nicaraguan government and rebel leaders broke off their first talks in three months after failing to agree on a new site for resuming peace negotiations. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> accused the rebels, known as Contras, of seeking to avoid negotiations in hopes of receiving new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. The rebel delegation rejected the government's demand that future talks resume in the Nicaraguan capital of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, chief rebel delegate <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said after Monday's four-hour meeting. He said the rebels proposed <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> as the negotiating site. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, head of the government delegation, said the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were sticking by their position that the talks be held in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Monday's meeting was called as a preliminary step to resuming high-level talks to end the 7-year civil war. Those negotiations broke down June 9. No date for another meeting was announced. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Monday night, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> noted that his government had bowed to rebel demands to hold previous talks in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He accused the rebels of deliberately trying to make negotiations impossible in a bid to receive renewed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> are interested, through the Contras, in trying to show <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has an intransigent position ... to approve military aid for the counterrevolutionaries. This is the objective,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> declared. `` We should speak with -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. We should speak to those who pay the gunslingers and not the gunslingers,'' he said in remarks broadcast by state-run radio. Ferrey renewed a rebel proposal that high-level talks be held Sept. 26-28, but not in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. His delegation also demanded the government release more than 40 opposition activists arrested during demonstrations in July and guarantee freedom of expression before further talks are held. For his part, <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> reiterated the government's demand that the Contras free 66 prisoners of war being held in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. In March, the two sides signed a preliminary cease-fure accord and agreed to seek a negotiated settlement to the conflict the government says has killed 28,000 Nicaraguans. The agreement called on the rebels to lay down their arms in exchange for democratic reforms. Shortly before peace talks broke off in June, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> proposed a timetable for disarmament and political reforms. But the Contras rejected the plan, saying it did not go far enough. They demanded freedom for political prisoners and democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> before disarming. Direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels ended Feb. 29. Non-lethal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras is distributed only in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. About 9,000 rebel fighters have fled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> during the past four months for base camps inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to receive new supplies of uniforms and food.

 Share prices plunged on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar inched up against the Japanese yen. The dollar closed at 134.15 yen, up 0.35 yen from Monday's close of 133.80 yen. After opening at 133.62 yen, the currency gained further ground during the day's session, moving within a range of 133.57-134 .15 yen The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues plunged 352.42 points, or 1.26 percent, to finish the day's session at 27,548.58. The market's main index dropped sharply at the start of trading Tuesday and continued its downward spiral to record the largest single-day decline since Sept. 10, when the index lost 431.69 points. Prices were lower across the board with the exception of a few pulp and paper issues, according to traders. A dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said share prices fell `` because of a selling drive among investors'' due to the decline overnight in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading. `` There might be some concern over the emperor's -LRB- <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> -RRB- condition among investors, but it's not a major factor affecting trading,'' the dealer said. But other dealers said buy orders were on the rise for paper-related issues in anticipation of a sharp increase in the demand for paper in the near future. The demand for paper rises with the death of any member of the imperial family as government and business offices print large volumes of announcements. Aging Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> vomited blood late Monday and was given two blood transfusions. Palace officials maintained that his condition was `` nothing to be concerned about.'' In foreign exchange, the dollar opened at 133.62 yen, down 0.18 yen from Monday's close, and was trading at 133.77 yen by late morning.

 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> is giving its members more time to vote on their presidential preference, putting off the union's possible endorsement of a candidate until mid-October. `` My guess is that we're not going to do any endorsement until our next board meeting Oct. 17,'' Teamsters spokesman <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON> said the 1.6 million-member union has extended until Sept. 30 the deadline for the rank and file to return poll ballots on presidential preferences that were mailed to them three weeks ago. <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON> said 10,000 to 12,000 of the ballots have been returned to <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' headquarters here but have not been tallied. With the extended deadline, he said, the responses can not be tabulated and analyzed before the next meeting of the union's 18-member executive board Oct. 17-19 in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> The Teamsters were among three of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s 91 affiliated unions that abstained last month from the labor federation's overwhelming endorsement of Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Until the death of former Teamster President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> in June, union officials had expected the executive board to endorse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

 A Colombian national faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole after becoming the first woman convicted under the 2-year-old federal drug kingpin law, a prosecutor says. A jury deliberated 14 hours before returning a guilty verdict Monday against <PERSON> Eucaris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceballos </PERSON> for being the `` principal administrator'' of a drug network that sold 2,600 to 3,300 kilograms of cocaine in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> during a seven-month period last year. The enterprise netted hundreds of millions of dollars, authorities said. Ms. <PERSON> Ceballos </PERSON>, 54, also known as <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Tulia </PERSON>, faces a mandatory life prison sentence without parole, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurow </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonageri </PERSON>. Setencing in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled for Nov. 21. Defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Furlong </PERSON> said he will appeal. The jury will return Thursday to determine whether Ms. <PERSON> Ceballos </PERSON>, who had lived in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, must surrender her home, to the federal government. Under the federal racketeering law, property used in the commission of certain crimes can be confiscated by authorities. Prosecutors argued during the trial that Ms. <PERSON> Ceballos </PERSON> directed a ring of Colombian drug dealers who distributed high-quality cocaine. Three other defendants also were convicted of cocaine conspiracy charges. Besides her conviction for being the `` principal administrator of a continuing criminal enterprise,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ceballos </PERSON> was found guilty of two counts of using the telephone in the commission of crimes. Ms. <PERSON> Ceballos </PERSON> was the first woman ever convicted under the 1986 kingpin law, also called the federal principal administrator statute, Ms. <PERSON> Sonageri </PERSON> said. The law carries strict penalties for anyone convicted of being the leader of a drug network and supervising at least five people; making a substantial income from the operation; violating at least three felony drug laws; and distributing at least 150 kilograms of cocaine during the operation. Ms. <PERSON> Ceballos </PERSON> was among 21 people arrested in November in the case. With the exception of the four convicted Monday, the others pleaded guilty to drug-related charges.

 Share prices plunged today on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in apparent reaction to Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s failing health. The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 352.42 points or 1.26 percent to close at 27,548.58. The main index, which rapidly lost 169.20 points to move down to 27,731.80 points shortly after the market opened, kept declining afterwards. It was the fourth biggest one-day decline this year. In a moderate trading with volume on the first section estimated at 1 billion shares, stock prices were lower across the board except for a few print-related issues such as paper and pulp, said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` Investors were mainly selling stocks trying to get ready if the worst happens to the emperor.

 Protesters and soldiers retreated today from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s streets, where troops shot to death at least 100 people during demonstrations against a military coup. The two sides fought sporadic clashes late Monday, with some protesters hurling gasoline bombs at troops, who responded with gunfire. Automatic weapons fire was heard from <LOCATION> Seikkyi </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from the capital, and smoke could be seen billowing from the village. At least 150 people were killed in the capital during protests against Sunday's coup, which was led by armed forces commander Gen. Saw Maung. No casualty figures were available from other cities, where clashes were also reported. Today, downtown streets appeared deserted, peopled only with some soldiers clearing roadblocks demonstrators had erected and residents hurrying home after buying food at a few small shops. Most troops remained inside government buildings. Opposition leaders said they called off street protests to avoid further bloodshed. They said government workers would protest by continuing their strikes past Sept. 26, the new military regime's deadline for returning to work on threat of dismissal It was the first day without street demonstrations in the capital since a round of rallies and strikes called to press for an end to 26 years of repressive one-party rule began on Aug. 8 and toppled hard-line President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> four days later. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said he ousted President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> on Sunday in a bid to halt economic and social chaos and ensure democratic elections _ which <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> had promised. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who took over Aug. 19 as <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader since 1962, had ended martial law and withdrawn soldiers from the streets in the start of a series of concessions to protesters. Troops returned in force after <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> took power and enforced his ban on public gatherings by shooting monks, students, striking government workers and other unarmed demonstrators in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Reporters who witnessed the confrontations said at least 100 people were killed on Monday, some of them shot by soldiers perched on rooftops. About 40 demonstrators and 17 soldiers died in clashes around the capital on Sunday night. Demonstrations also broke out in other cities, including <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, the second largest city in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. An <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat quoted doctors as saying 67 victims were taken to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> General Hospital on Monday. A military spokesman said incomplete reports showed 23 people were killed and 23 wounded in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and three other towns. Three key opposition leaders, reacting to the killings, vowed in a joint statement Monday to `` continue our struggle for democracy by various means until the goal is achieved.'' The statement was issued by former Brig.

 About 100 protesters demanding the Olympics be stopped burned a giant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag and chanted anti-American slogans today outside a hotel where top Olympic officials are staying. Riot police in green combat fatigues and black visored helmets watched, but did not intervene as the radical students burned the homemade flag after marching out of <ORGANIZATION> Donguk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. `` Get out <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> which support the dictatorial regime!'' the students chanted as the 10-foot-high flag, doused in gasoline, went up in a blast of orange flame. The protest was held outside the school gate, about 900 feet away from the <LOCATION> Shila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, where the International Olympic Committee and athletic officials have been staying during the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Games. The Olympics run through Oct. 2. Protesters dispersed peacefully after the incident and did not try to approach the heavily-guarded hotel. Passers-by ignored the protest. Students earlier held a rally on the campus to demand the Olympics be halted because they claimed the Games were being used by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as a pretext to stage military maneuvers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese forces are helping <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> protect the Olympics from any potential threat from communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 42,000 troops based in the South under a defense treaty. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to be a co-host of the Games was rejected. South Korean officials fear the North may stage a terrorist attack to disrupt the Games. Radical students, opposed to the Olympics because <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is not participating, have staged a number of protests in recent days. The protests have been small and mostly peaceful. Radicals at some other <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> campuses handed out leaflets criticizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic team for its behavior Saturday during the Games' opening ceremony. Some American athletes wore <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> ears or carried signs with messages for relatives. `` The ugliness of <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> was fully displayed during the opening parade,'' the leaflets said. The International Olympic Committee criticized the behavior of the American team in a letter to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic Committee.

<TEXT>
 A drug smuggler and a former Mexican police official were pawns in a vendetta brought about by two countries that desperately wanted to avenge the death of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent, defense attorneys say. `` Demand justice, not politics,'' attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pancer </PERSON> urged jurors Monday, insisting that <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquidez </PERSON>, 36, had nothing to do with the 1985 torture-slaying of <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> was offered up to you on a silver platter by the police in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pancer </PERSON> told the jury. `` Are you going to take the scapegoat they offer you?'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> scheduled the prosecutor's rebuttal argument today, saying he would submit the case to the jury later in the day <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>, chief deputy federal public defender, said another defendant, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, 28, a former <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> homicide investigator, is a victim of the government's desire to avenge the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> killing at any cost. She contended that the defendant's videotaped discussion of the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> slaying with an undercover agent was typical of his penchant for inventing stories to inflate his own importance. `` Mr. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> ended up in this trial for acting like a child,'' she said. `` He is a man caught up in the web of his own lies. He told one lie too many.'' Admitting that <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> was a marijuana smuggler, <PERSON> Pancer </PERSON> accused Mexican officials of conspiring to blame Verdugo for <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s killing He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government went along with the idea. `` Ladies and gentlemen, tell the government of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> by your verdict that you will not accept a scapegoat,'' said <PERSON> Pancer </PERSON>. `` Tell them that you want the people who were really involved and who are being protected down there.'' He accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors of engaging in `` illusion, deception and lies'' to convince jurors that <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> participated in <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s torture and murder. `` The government has tried to appeal to your emotions,'' he said, `` to make you feel guilty about rendering the correct verdict. Do n't let them do that.'' <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was abducted in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1985. His body and that of his pilot, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON>, were found buried at a remote ranch in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> several weeks later. They were severely beaten and <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s skull was crushed. Prosecutors sought to show that <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> was a leader of a drug cartel run by <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> and that he helped kill <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>. Authorities have depicted <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> as the mastermind of the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> killing. The third defendant, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, 38, is accused of helping <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> escape from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> after the killings. Key evidence against <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> is a strand of his hair found at the <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> home where <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> is believed to have died and the testimony of a witness who saw <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> at the house near the time of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s death. Nine men were indicted in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in connection with the slaying, but only three are on trial here. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>, 33, and three other defendants are in custody and awaiting trial on related charges in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. An eighth man has died and another is a fugitive.

<HEAD>Former Chief Astronaut Disappointed With Space Program Progress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former chief astronaut says the emphasis on the space shuttle is to blame for a slowdown in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s space program. Astronaut <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who flew on the first manned Gemini mission in 1965 and later walked on the moon, expressed disappointment with the space program's progress in a recent interview. `` It is almost 20 years since we landed people on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, 57. `` And if you had asked me after the moon landing what we'd be doing in 20 years, I'd have said we'd have a base on the moon in 20 years.'' Young, now a safety and engineering trouble-shooter for <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s director, commanded the first and ninth shuttle flights while serving as chief astronaut for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admininstration </ORGANIZATION>. He said the shuttles on which <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> staked its future in the early 1970s have never been the inexpensive, quickly refurbished workhorses that their supporters promised. `` I never believed it could be that way,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` I was n't involved in selling it, but I was involved in the technical details of helping design and build it, and it was too complicated.'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the shuttle is capable of fulfilling its creators' expectations, but tight budgets hurt it when <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> could not afford to stockpile spare parts for quick repairs And, he said, the spacecraft's design can slow repairs because some areas are hard to reach. He said that quick shuttle turnarounds and reflights and routine <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> landings never panned out, nor is the shuttle an inexpensive way to fly. The basic assumption that it pays to salvage and reuse each $ 15 million solid-fuel rocket booster may be wrong, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. He also said the delays are affecting the supply of flight-ready astronauts. Fourteen astronauts who flew before the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion decided not to wait for flights to resume. The space center has 93 astronauts and is accepting applications through July 1 for a 1990 astronaut class. `` I expect there's a lot of astronauts leaving because they see the line at the end of the tunnel,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` The line they've got to stand in to get a flight is so long.

<HEAD>Court Considers Settlement For Buyers Of Discontinued Kodak
Cameras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> customers who bought the company's discontinued instant cameras says only about 200 people have balked at a plan to give them $ 50 to $ 70 in cash and coupons. Attorney <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berke </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> on Monday that about 3.4 million people have been approved for compensation. `` It demonstrates you have an overwhelming approval of the settlement,'' <PERSON> Berke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, who presided over a hearing in the case, said he would rule Sept. 26 on whether the proposed $ 195 million plan should be accepted to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by customers. The cameras were rendered virtually useless in 1985 when a federal court said the company had violated several <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> patents on instant film and cameras. That court ordered <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> to stop producing film for its line of instant cameras. Under the proposal, those who bought the cameras would receive $ 19.50 to $ 52 in cash, with the balance made up in coupons for the purchase of other <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> products, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit. The amount would depend upon the model of camera the person owned, he said. `` It is clearly a generous settlement. It is clearly a fair settlement,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>. Critics of the plan say an insufficient amount of money is involved, no provision exists to compensate for accessories like camera bags and some steps toward getting a rebate were difficult. The proposed settlement is limited to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> owners. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> made 16 million of the instant cameras for domestic sale from 1976 to 1985. <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> said 4.3 million camera owners were notified of the settlement proposal by direct mail, and 3.4 million have valid claims. About 100,000 more filed claims that are being reviewed by a court-appointed arbitrator, he said. The deadline for filing claims was Sept. 9, and those who have not filed will not be able to get refunds, he added. Instant photography was invented by <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Land </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, and was first marketed in 1948. It enables users to view a photographic print within moments of taking a picture. Polaroid retained a monopoly in the instant photography field until 1976, when <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> entered the market with a competing system. A week later, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, charging patent infringement. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> sided with <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> let stand lower court rulings when it refused to hear <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal in October 1986 Polaroid is seeking $ 5.7 billion in damages from <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>.

 A fugitive wanted for taking hostages at a newspaper is back in federal authorities' hands after disappearing three weeks ago. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 30, accused of holding up to 20 hostages at The Robesonian in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION> on Feb. 1, was arrested Monday as he and an attorney arrived on a <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, just minutes before <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s scheduled arraignment. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, an American Indian, and a second man charged in the incident said they were protesting alleged corruption and discrimination against minorities by <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> law enforcement officials. The attorney, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, declined to discuss his client's whereabouts. When <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> was asked where he had been since his disappearance Aug. 31, he responded, `` Over the rainbow.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Berryhill </PERSON> said authorities did not know where <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> had been. `` It's rather academic at this point, but yet from an investigator's standpoint, tying up our investigation, we need to try to find out where he's been,'' <PERSON> Berryhill </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> decided to surrender after the arraignment date was announced last week, <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said. Airport security officers grabbed <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and frisked him in a covered passageway just outside the airplane door. A security officer guarded the door into the terminal while officers cuffed <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s hands behind his back and led him to a car waiting on the tarmac. While <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> was being taken into custody at the airport, his case was called in a federal courtroom in downtown <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. `` We notified them this morning to watch all flights coming into <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> because we felt like with his arraignment today he might come in,'' <PERSON> Berryhill </PERSON> said. He added that marshals had no tips that <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> would return to <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, watched through an airport window as officials led her brother to the waiting car. She sobbed, pounded on the window and waved in an attempt to get her brother's attention as reporters and photographers stood around her. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> looked up and smiled at her. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who had rented a limousine to take his brother to the arraignment, grimaced when he saw his brother in custody. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, who was born <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, adopted his grandfather's family name after the elder man died in 1985. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> entered a plea of innocent on <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s behalf, and set his trial to begin Sept. 26, the same day that <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s co-defendant, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, is scheduled to stand trial. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> disappeared after the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> revoked his bond.

 The dollar was little changed in subdued European trading early today ahead of the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic reports and a weekend meeting of the seven leading industrialized nations. Gold prices were higher. Dealers said they doubted that the final revision of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product figures for the second quarter, would stimulate the markets. Dealers were anticipating a 3.3 percent growth rate in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. The August rate of inflation was due to be released later in the week. Dealers said market players were withdrawing to the sidelines ahead of Saturday's opening meeting in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> of finance ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized democracies. `` The market is very calm and should stay so as long as the dollar is awaiting some new stimulus,'' said a dealer in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar edged up 0.35 Japanese yen to a closing 134.15 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it fell back to 133.90 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday: _ 1.8690 West German marks, down from 1.8695 _ 1.5785 Swiss francs, down from 1.5793 _ 6.3545 French francs, up from 6.3520 _ 2.1080 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1100 _ 1,392.25 Italian lire, down from 1,393.50 _ 1.2192 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2194 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound held steady at $ 1.6785 dollars, unchanged Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 409.40 dollars a troy ounce, up from $ 409.30 dollars bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 410.40. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the noon bid price was $ 410.30, up from $ 408.50 bid late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 1.72 dollars to close at a bid $ 413.12.

<TEXT>
 Three Soviet MiG-17 fighter jets roared over <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, tracked by the whirling arms of Chinese-built early-warning radar hidden in a canyon. It was only a test. `` We want to understand what the guy we're up against can do, what his equipment can do,'' <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Test </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. The agency is testing Soviet, Chinese and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military hardware at <ORGANIZATION> Kirtland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> just outside <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> this month to see how well it works, how long it takes to do its job and what problems turn up, said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. In Monday's test, the MiG-17s flew south from <LOCATION> Kirtland </LOCATION> into the pinon-studded <LOCATION> Manzano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, where the radar waited. Down from the radar site were antenna fields, trailers with technicians peering into scopes and simulated artillery sites. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> A-7 attack jets from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> took to the air to determine how quickly they could be picked up on the Chinese radar and how swiftly an alert could be relayed to an anti-aircraft missile site, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The agency plans to use its foreign equipment to find out how well <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hardware performs. For example, officials said, tests might find out how easy it is to detect a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jet on Soviet radar. The agency has spent the past year gathering <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> equipment ranging from radios to radar and from tracked vehicles to fighter aircraft. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> declined to say how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> acquired the hardware. Much of the equipment was displayed Monday at a <LOCATION> Kirtland </LOCATION> hangar. Outside were MiGs and a troop transport plane; inside were tables covered with radios and the components needed to keep them working, as well as operating manuals written in Russian. While the MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters are older versions of what Soviet pilots now fly, they remain in the air as part of the forces of such countries as <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said. `` Just because it looks little and small does n't mean it ca n't hurt you,'' he said The Soviet and Chinese radios on display, used by <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> countries, do n't have the modern microchips found in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> equipment, but instead use vacuum tubes _ technology developed in the 1940s and 1950s. But what the equipment lacks in techological sophistication, it makes up for in simplicity, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said. Such radios are easy to maintain, easy to use and very tough. Vacuum tubes are also less susceptible to the electromagnetic pulses that would follow a nuclear detonationo and disrupt communications and power, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said. `` They are prepared to operate in a nuclear environment more than we thought,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> teamed up with other major rockers in the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concert of a worldwide tour aimed at inspiring people to join <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s fight for human rights. `` You have the opportunity to use your freedom to help free others,'' said <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, the closing act at Monday's sold-out performance at <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>. More than 75,000 people attended the 7 -LCB- - hour show, concert officials said No major problems were reported. Joining <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> were Sting, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, Senegalese singer <PERSON> Yousoou </PERSON> N'Dour, folk singer <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baez </PERSON> and saxophonist <PERSON> Branford </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON>. It was n't the first time rock stars banded together for a good cause at the stadium. In 1985, the arena was the site of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> half of the Live Aid concert to fight hunger. Monday's concert opened with the entire group singing the reggae anthem, `` Get Up, Stand Up.'' <PERSON> Baez </PERSON> followed with the the spiritual, `` Oh, Freedom.'' The crowd listened to N'Dour's brand of African rhythms and <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s songs of protest and lament. But it was n't until Sting performed more familiar songs of his own and his former band, The Police, that the crowd began to respond. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, the driving force behind the tour, reminded the crowd about the more serious aspects of the tour. Throwing his fist into the air, he sang `` <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>,'' in memory of <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>, the black South African political activist who died while imprisoned in the apartheid state. <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> native, was clearly the favorite, as calls for `` Bruce'' drowned out the audio from an animated video illustrating the tenets of the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. London-based <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors human rights abuses and political prisoners, distributed literature and asked for signatures on petitions supporting the declaration. The organization, with a worldwide membership of 750,000, won the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize. Amnesty International Executive Director <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Healey </PERSON> said the group has collected about 500,000 signatures so far, and half of those attending the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> concert signed the Amnesty petition. `` Sign it, use it, believe in it,'' he encouraged the crowd. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohne </PERSON>, a 28-year-old homemaker from <LOCATION> Brewster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the concert had galvanized her to start writing letters for <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` It enlightens you to what's going on. Day-to-day life makes you forget,'' she said. `` A concert like this brings that out. It slaps you in the face.'' But <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, a 46-year-old sales representative from <LOCATION> Sicklerville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was skeptical about the concert's message reaching many people. `` It's good music. Most of them are political songs, but I do n't think it's registering in people's heads,'' he said The budget for the tour, which began in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Sept. 2, is estimated at $ 23 million. Although performers are donating their time, organizers said they expect expenses to outstrip ticket sales. The tour is partially underwritten with a $ 10 million commitment from footwear manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. The tour is due in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Sept. 21 and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Sept. 23. Tour officials said they expect to play to more than a million people in 14 countries and are negotiating to perform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 A recruit who drowned during rescue-swimmer training had been declared unfit for the course because of his intense fear of being dragged under water, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> doctor testified at a sailor's court-martial. After Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiveley </PERSON>'s testimony, the defense rested its case Monday in the trial of Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The defendant is charged with involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy in the March 2 death of Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> in a training pool at <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. The trial reopens Thursday with closing arguments. The military judge, Cmdr. <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krogmann </PERSON>, was to meet today with lawyers to prepare instructions for the panel of five officers hearing the case. One panel member asked for an additional day's delay because Wednesday is Yom Kippur, a Jewish holiday, said Lt. Cmdr <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Shiveley </PERSON> conceded Monday the system probably broke down by allowing the 19-year-old recruit from <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, to return to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Shiveley </PERSON> disqualified him from further training. `` He related a pretty intense fear to me,'' said <PERSON> Shiveley </PERSON>, who saw <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> a month before his death. `` I diagnosed him as possibly having a phobia.'' A psychologist disagreed with <PERSON> Shiveley </PERSON>'s diagnosis and found <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> fit for training, but neither doctor consulted the other. <PERSON> Shiveley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> should have been sent back to him before being readmitted. <PERSON> Shiveley </PERSON> said while a noncommissioned officer such as Combe can not be expected to detect a phobia, he should have recognized <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s panic. Witnesses have testified <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> panicked and climbed out of the pool, grabbing an equipment rack as instructors converged on him. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was pulled free and thrown into the pool where <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> dunked him and grabbed him in a head hold, witnesses say. A pathologist has testified <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s phobia triggered heart failure, then drowning. Two fellow instructors, who testified under immunity, backed up testimony by <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, who denied he helped push <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> back into the pool and claimed the recruit completed a lifesaving maneuver, in which he freed himself from a head hold, just seconds before collapsing.

<TEXT>
 A congressional authority on the Constitution predicted today that a controversial anti-drug bill will pass the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> this week by a wide margin despite measures he called `` stupid'' and `` outrageous'' attacks on the Bill of Rights. `` I think the bill will pass overwhelmingly because there's some kind of hysteria on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights He said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning'' program that four tough amendments added on bipartisan votes last week are `` pretty awful.'' But he said congressmen will vote for the bill `` no matter what the provisions are, if one can appear to be tough on drugs ... it'll pass big.'' Asked whether the House was effectively waging a `` war on the Bill of Rights,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said, `` Yes, that's what is happening.'' Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., in the same interview, termed <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' objections `` nonsense `` I think -LRB- the -RRB- provisions are constitutional. And I think they have the support of the majority of the members,'' <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said. The House is expected to vote on the final bill Thursday. Approval would mean the differences with a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version would have to be worked out by a conference committee of the two chambers. The amendments that have drawn scorn from civil libertarians would establish: _ A federal death penalty for those convicted of murder in a drug-related crime _ Denial of federal welfare and other benefits to repeat drug offenders _ An exception to the so-called exclusionary rule that would allow into court evidence seized without a search warrant _ A civil fine of up to $ 10,000 for individuals accused of possessing even small amounts of drugs, whether or not there is a conviction <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said the fine would be `` an outrage. Never before in American history have we had civil penalties in criminal matters.'' And he said supporters of tough measures against drug trafficking were defeating their own efforts with the death penalty provision. `` The stupid part about this amendment is that hereafter, if the bill passes, we wo n't be able to extradict drug offenders from overseas because countries that do n't have the death penalty _ and most do n't _ just wo n't send them back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be executed,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Millions Exposed to Disease, Diarrhea Cases Rising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HASAN SAEED</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Millions of people in the capital have been exposed to serious health hazards by drinking contaminated water, and the number of cases of diarrhea has soared in the past 24 hours, officials said today. `` In most cases the water flowing out of the pipes is unfit for drinking,'' an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The floods that inundated three-fourths of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> three weeks ago have claimed at least 2,000 lives, according to <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers. They said one-fourth of the deaths were caused by diarrhea, while the others were from drowning, snake bites and houses collapsing. The government, whose count is generally considered low, puts the total number of deaths at about 1,000. The newspapers say at least one million of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s 110 million people have been stricken by diarrhea in the past four weeks. The government reported 618,656 diarrhea cases, including 47,361 in the past 24 hours. It said 268 people have died of diarrhea. The pollution control official said tests Sunday showed the count of coliform bacteria, linked to intestinal diseases, in tap water was as high as 4,000 per hundred milliliters in some areas of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. He said the permissible limit was 4 per hundred milliliters. Water samples collected at government relief camps showed a coliform bacteria count of up to 1,600 per hundred milliliters, he added. Excessive quantities of coliform bacteria in drinking water can cause diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid, jaundice and pneumonia. Floodwaters that covered about three-fourths of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million, leaked into municipal water pipes. The official said many pipes had leaks that could not be repaired because they were under water. As the floodwaters recede, the municipal corporation has been closing the 465 refugee centers set up in schools and colleges so classes can resume. Some of the refugees said they had nowhere to go. <PERSON> Rahimullah </PERSON>, a 45-year-old day laborer, went from door to door today with his three children. `` After trying for the last three days to get a job, I am now begging for food for my family,'' he said. <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Hossain </PERSON>, 45, said he had come to <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> after his house in <LOCATION> Khadun </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of the capital, was flooded. `` I have no money to rebuild the house and start life afresh,'' he said. `` Nobody in the village is willing to extend a loan to me.'' A Relief Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said millions affected by the floods were faced with the same problems. The government estimates that 40 million people _ more than one-fourth of the country's population _ were directly affected by the flood.

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 3 new grafs after pvs 6th graf bgng, The results,
with new poll on Dukakis tank ride.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in an effective tie with Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the cornerstone of the industrial Northeast, while the Republican presidential nominee held substantial advantages in polls conducted in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. A poll released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic candidate, leading <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 48-42 percent among likely voters. But the margin of error of four percentage points either way erased <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' seeming advantage. Ten percent of those polled said they were undecided. The statistical dead heat came even though 65 percent of potential <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voters said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has the experience to be president'' and only 23 percent named the Democrat. At the same time, 52 percent said the vice president `` has the ability to handle an international crisis,'' while 28 percent said that of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Nonetheless, when it comes to who can provide strong leadership, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was on top, 43 percent to 36 percent, among New Yorkers questioned. The results were similar to a <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll in March that gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a 47-41 percentage advantage. A separate poll indicated that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lost rather than gained voter support when he posed last week wearing a helmet and riding an M-1 battle tank at a defense contractor's plant in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. In a telephone survey of 1,002 registered voters around the country last Friday through Sunday, conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and station <ORGANIZATION> WBZ-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, 25 percent said they were less likely to vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> based on what they had seen or heard about the tank ride. Seven percent said the ride made them more likely to vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, according to the poll, and more than 60 percent said they either knew nothing about it or it had no impact on how they would vote. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percent. With 36 of the 270 <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> votes needed to win the presidency, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> carries more weight than any other single state in the traditionally-Democratic Northeast. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has been considered a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stronghold, in part because Democrats have a 3-2 enrollment edge over Republicans and also because <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is from a neighboring state. But the state was captured by Republican <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and again in 1984. In 1984, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> headed up <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> effort and was unable to deliver the state for the former vice president. Polls released Monday in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, which respectively have seven and five electoral votes, indicated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is holding his comfortable leads in those states. Nebraskans favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 44-33 percent, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION> poll published Monday. The margin of error in the survey of 755 registered voters conducted Sept. 14-15 by <ORGANIZATION> SRI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was plus or minus four percentage points. In <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, a telephone survey over last weekend by <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the preferred choice of 49 percent of those polled while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the pick of only 34 percent. The poll of 1,000 registered voters showed just about the same margin as a survey conducted a month ago. It had a margin of error of five percentage points in either direction, however. The <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted last week surveyed 601 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voters said to be likely to cast ballots in the Nov. 8 election.

<HEAD>Assembly GOP Staffers Purged Computer Files</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fearful that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would nab them, high-ranking aides to Republican assemblymen erased computer records that showed they worked on political campaigns on state time, a newspaper reported today. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> sources told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that after the material was deleted, earlier computer printouts and political fund-raising letters were moved from the offices. The aides were worried that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents working on Operation Brispec, a corruption probe, would learn of their activities. Documents eliminated in the computer purge were `` prepared at state time using state paper, state equipment,'' a legislative source said, adding that both parties `` do it and all of that's paid out of the contingency fund of the Legislature. Under state law, it is illegal for legislative staffers to use public equipment or money for party work. One source, who did not want to be identified, said the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> operated `` a full-time campaign office at taxpayer expense,'' the newspaper said. The Times was given copies of political files that had been put into state computers. Material included orders to run background follow-ups on 13 lawmakers. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> sting has targeted four <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-area </LOCATION> lawmakers and six others to determine if lawmakers would take bribes in exchange for legislative support.

<HEAD>House Adopts Resolution Against Rice Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The lower house of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament today unanimously adopted a resolution against further opening the nation's rice market to foreign imports. The resolution, passed in a plenary session of the 512-member Diet, is not binding and is only an `` expression of dietmen,'' said a parliament official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The action followed a petition filed Wednesday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rice producers seeking greater access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s protected rice market. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, in a petition filed with the office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative, claimed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s virtual ban on rice imports constitutes unfair trade practices. Under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade act, such practices are subject to penalties. The trade representative must decide within 45 days whether to proceed with the case. `` Rice production is a major matter of concern for all Japanese as the basis of maintaining and developing a sound society,'' the resolution says. It notes rice production affects local communities, the preservation of land and Japanese culture. The Japanese official said parliament's upper house, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Councillors </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to adopt a similar resolution Wednesday. Officials have said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is willing to discuss rice imports at the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based body that sets international trade rules and provides a forum for settling disputes. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the government controls rice distribution by purchasing much of the grain directly from farmers at fixed prices and selling it to retailers at lower prices. But Japanese consumers still pay seven to eight times more for rice than do Americans, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry officials.

<HEAD>Atlanta To Fine Abortion Protest Leaders Who Break Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 City officials, exasperated by almost daily anti-abortion demonstrations this summer, have passed a bill to fine protest leaders who trespass or harass patients at abortion clinics. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted 12-5 Monday for a measure which asks the city attorney's office to seek court injunctions against leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, the group that organized the protests. The measure does not interfere with the right to picket and to free speech, council members said. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Magera </PERSON>, a staff member of Operation Rescue in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the decision would not deter the group, which has taken September off from the protests but vows to return in October. She said similar actions were taken in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, but protests continued. The protests that began during the Democratic National Convention in July clogged the city's legal system, putting more than 700 people in jail and costing <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> more than $ 500,000, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>, chairwoman of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and sponsor of Monday's resolution. `` They are trying to grind the machinery of this city to a halt,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> said. Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he planned to challenge the constitutionality of the decision in court. The civil rights leader compared it to laws passed in the past to deny rights to blacks. `` This is a very dangerous bill,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` It's going to put <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in such a bad light.'' However, Councilman <PERSON> Jabari </PERSON> <PERSON> Simama </PERSON> said the bill `` will not deny this group's rights to exercise its First Amendment rights.''

 After-tax corporate profits jumped 8.9 percent in the second quarter of this year, the best performance in nearly five years, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said after-tax profits rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 162.7 billion, up $ 13.3 billion from the first quarter. It was the biggest jump since an 11.4 percent increase in the third quarter of 1983. However, today's report for the April-June quarter represents a downward revision from an estimate last month when the department said profits after tax soared 11.5 percent. Profits were up 2.5 percent in the first quarter. Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds companies have for investment, rose 1.4 percent in the second quarter following a 0.9 percent increase in the January-March period. Dividend payments to stockholders rose 1.8 percent in the second quarter to an annual rate of $ 103.1 billion.

 Thousands of people rallied in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> today, closing businesses and schools in a protest that followed a bloody clash between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in a disputed region of the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, one of the 25 people who the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said had been hurt in Sunday's shootout died the next day, an editor of a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> affiliate said. The clash occurred in the village of <LOCATION> Khadzhaly </LOCATION> in the predominantly Armenian <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> enclave of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Armenian activist <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from the Amenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, said Armenians did not use weapons. He did not elaborate. An editor for Armenpress, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> affiliate in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, said Monday that Azerbaijanis were the only ones carrying firearms. The executive committee of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s parliament was to meet today or Wednesday to discuss protesters' long-standing demands to annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said. Armenians began campaigning in February for control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> near the Turkish-Iranian border. Armenians make up 76 percent of the region's 162,000 people and have strong historical links to the enclave, which was made part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923. Several thousand people gathered today in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s downtown square, an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officer said, and were `` just standing around conversing.'' Police stepped up patrols in this city, said a duty officer at <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, speaking by telephone from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, a 46-year-old former political prisoner, said 1 million Armenians attended a rally in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> Monday night and demanded an emergency meeting of the republic's parliament, the Supreme Soviet. A deputy director of Armenpress, who spoke on condition his name not be used, said more than 250,000 people were at the demonstration. The protesters want the Supreme Soviet to demand the annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said. The body has made such a decision, but was rebuffed by the country's Supreme Soviet in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Voskanyan </PERSON>, told Monday's rally that parliament's executive committee would meet today or Wednesday to decide whether to call a full Supreme Soviet session, according to <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>. At Monday night's rally, demonstrators decided to continue a general strike that began Friday, according to <LOCATION> Popoyan </LOCATION>, and many businesses and schools were closed in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> today. He said the demonstrators decided to continue the walkout until the Supreme Soviet acts on their demands. A strike also has been reported in the main city of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>. An Armenpress editor said Sunday's clash was touched off by reports that <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON> had stoned a busload of Armenians the previous day in the village. A 61-year-old carpenter injured in the shootout died Monday in a hospital, an editor of a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> affiliate in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> said by telephone from the republic's capital, <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. Both editors spoke on condition of anonymity. In <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Vezirov </PERSON> told local officials today the clashes were part of `` anti-social activities'' among some of the populace, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. He said required stricter controls were needed to ensure order, the agency reported. Armenians are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>; most Azerbaijanis are Shiite Moslem. Armenians also differ linguistically and culturally from ethnic Azerbaijanis. At least 32 people, 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis, were killed in three days of rioting that began Feb. 28 in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. In July, central authorities in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> rejected the annexation demand and instead approved a plan to redress Armenians' grievances of poor housing, hospitals, schools and Armenian cultural facilities in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leaders said their launching of a test satellite reportedly packed with U.S.-made surveillance equipment would not spur the arms race in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Arab officials and newspapers called Monday's launch a `` spy satellite'' and said the craft would be used for military purposes and would threaten the entire Arab world. The launching of a three-stage rocket carrying the gray Horizon-1 satellite made <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> only the eighth nation to place a satellite in space. `` There are few countries in the world capable of doing this and the citizens of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can be proud of their country,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> voiced concern over the launch, saying the satellite gave <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` a serious strategic leverage'' since the country already had the capability to fire long-range missiles. The Libyan news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, described the craft as a `` spy satellite -LRB- and part of a -RRB- psychological war being carried out by the Zionists against the Arab nation.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tishrin </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> government newspaper whose editorials generally reflect official stands, also called the craft a `` spy satellite'' and predicted it would be used for military purposes. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to expand <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military power is a permanent source of danger and tension in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tishrin </ORGANIZATION> added. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s main enemy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, radio stations reported the launching with no comment. The Soviet media ignored the story, and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> official as saying the satellite apparently had military uses. Both <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> dismissed fears that the satellite would spur an arms race with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries. `` The Arabs bought missiles and produce missiles and will do anything they can anyway,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said on the radio. <PERSON> Yuval </PERSON> <PERSON> Neeman </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s space agency, said the satellite would remain in orbit for about a month before disintegrating. Development of the Horizon-1 was the result of more than 20 years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> space research and was part of the country's effort to become independent in the defense field Until now, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has relied on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to provide satellite pictures, but some officials have complained the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> was stingy in supplying intelligence information. In March 1987, former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison for selling <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military documents. Israeli media have quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources as saying the documents <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> delivered included satellite pictures of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> weapons and storage facilities. `` If you are fed from the crumbs of others according to their whims, this is very inconvenient and very difficult,'' said <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Amit </PERSON>, a former head of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> secret service and now chief of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications satellites producer. A possible source of concern to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the news that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is deploying Chinese-built CSS-2 missiles about 285 miles south of <LOCATION> Riyad </LOCATION>. Satellite photographs displayed by <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a private Swedish firm, showed the Saudis were expanding an airstrip and a military complex to accommodate the new weapons. The Israeli satellite weighs about 340 pounds and is believed to be carrying a 6.6-pound payload for surveillance usage, apparently for monitoring activity in Arab countries, according to a spokesman for <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based defense magazine. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s reporter with close ties to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military sources, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was not believed to have the capability of installing sophisticated surveillance equipment in a satellite. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> optical equipment is assumed to have been used in the payload,'' <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not involved with the Israeli program. Pentagon officials said they were unsure exactly what was in the satellite's payload. One source said on condition of anonymity that `` we're leaning toward more of an experimental communications package as opposed to a true spy satellite.'' Foreign reports said earlier that the satellite was a test craft that would precede the launching of a spy satellite. <PERSON> Neeman </PERSON> said a second satellite was already under development and would be used to carry out scientific tests.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> could spend at least five years in jail, separated from the family he tried to protect, for fatally shooting a youth who was among neighborhood troublemakers pelting his house with snowballs. Youths had harassed the family repeatedly for six years. They had broken into a basement radio repair shop and scrawled graffiti on the walls. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> finally cracked when a snowball smashed a window and cut one of his daughters on Jan. 30, 1987. Later that night, more snowballs hit the house and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> went out on his porch with a .357 - caliber Magnum He fired two shots toward a group of boys. He intended them as warnings, he told police. But one shot hit <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McGettigan </PERSON> in the spine and exited through his chest. The 16-year-old high school sophomore died, leaving his parents, six siblings, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s family and their neighborhood in agony. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 49, was convicted Monday of third-degree murder and sentenced to five to 10 years in prison. Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> also found <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> guilty of weapons possession and reckless endangerment in the non-jury trial. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> received the mandatory minimum term for third-degree murder while using a gun. He could receive up to seven more years when sentenced on the other charges Nov. 29. But one positive outcome of all of the anguish was the formation of a neighborhood group, <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a crime prevention officer with the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said has helped defuse tension. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the circumstances that pushed <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> over the brink were common in the city's <LOCATION> Olney </LOCATION> section, a blue-collar neighborhood. `` The kids actually controlled their community in the sense that the adults feared coming out of their houses because of harassment,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. But with the new community organization, he added: `` Some of the kids that I saw that were responsible for some of the tensions have changed completely. We probably saved a few lives. The tension at that time was such that it could have exploded again.'' Drugs, alcohol and the lack of places for teen-agers to gather were major problems, he said. <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> <PERSON> Fesi </PERSON>, the group's executive director, said it has helped six to eight youths enter education programs or obtain drug or alcohol treatment through the juvenile justice system. `` The community has to take ownership of the community,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fesi </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't have cops in your community 24 hours a day. We've got to do it, the people who live there.'' After Monday's verdict, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bluestine </PERSON>, said, `` It's just a very tragic situation all the way around.'' `` I feel bad for the family,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who remained free on $ 15,000 bail. `` I feel bad for the boy. I feel bad for the sorrow and grief I've brought my own family.'' The dead youth's mother, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGettigan </PERSON>, said: `` My son is dead 18 months. Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s family has been through God knows what in those 18 months and they have more to go through. It's been lousy all the way through, and I'm sorry it happened.'' Her husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, added: `` The only person I do n't feel sorry for is <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>.'' The group formed in the wake of the killing has suffered setbacks in its efforts to raise money for a community center, Mrs. <PERSON> Fesi </PERSON> said. A woman who took a public role in forming the group moved after she was harassed. `` We could never prove who did it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fesi </PERSON> said. `` They even threatened to bomb her house, so she had to move.'' <PERSON> Bluestine </PERSON> said he understood tensions remained, and his client also moved after the shooting. `` It's a bad situation up there, and from my understanding it's still continuing,'' he said `` There's still a lot of problems with teen-age boys.''

 The army sealed off the occupied lands today to prevent violence during the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday. Earlier, witnesses said an 11-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> boy was shot in the thigh by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> truck driver who was firing at stone throwers. The army erected roadblocks throughout the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to stop Palestinians from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during <LOCATION> Yom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kippur </LOCATION>, the day of atonement that was to begin shortly before sundown today. In the biblical city of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, four miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, drivers with blue <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> plates were turned away at an army checkpoint. A pink sign in Arabic read: `` Dear driver, the road to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is closed starting at 3 p.m.'' The army seals off the occupied lands for all Jewish High Holidays to lessen the possibility of Palestinian attacks inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In the 9-month-old uprising in the occupied lands, 269 Palestinians and six Israelis have been killed. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today, the driver of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> gasoline truck opened fire after his vehicle was stoned, said <PERSON> Naher </PERSON> <PERSON> Yussef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassilek </PERSON>, who was shot in the right thigh. `` I was passing near the gasoline pump on my way home when this man shot me,'' <PERSON> Hassilek </PERSON>, a newspaper delivery boy, told an Arab reporter at <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Arab witnesses said the same driver had opened fire in the area in the past, and that he shot and wounded an Arab youth earlier this year. The army said it was checking the report. Also today, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities complied with a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> order and disclosed that a 23-year-old Palestinian who died in 1987 during interrogation by secret service agents had suffocated. Israeli officials said earlier that <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON> died of a heart attack. <PERSON> Felicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Langer </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>'s family, said an autopsy also showed signs of an inflammation in his heart. She said she would petition the high court for disclosure of the exact circumstances of <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>, a resident of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, died July 21, 1987, two days after his arrest. Relatives alleged he was tortured to death by <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> secret service agents. Last year, Attorney General <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> ordered a police investigation into <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>'s death. Three Shin Bet agents were suspended for lying about the circumstances of the death. One agent was subsequently ordered to stand trial behind closed doors on charges he caused <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>'s death by negligence. Also today, five Americans on a Palestinian-sponsored tour protested the seizure of their passports by the army in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Army officials said the five incited an anti-Israeli demonstration in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and would have to submit to questioning by police to get their passports back. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate officials said they brought up the incident, which occurred Sunday, with the government. `` Our position is that American passports are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government property and should not be taken,'' consulate spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON> said. The Americans, touring the occupied lands at the invitation of the San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, claimed they were harassed, saying the passports were confiscated while troops were breaking up a demonstration by Palestinian women by using tear gas and rubber bullets. `` We watched, shocked and horrified,'' the group said in a statement. `` Before we knew it our passports were being demanded. No reason was given, nor was it explained how or when they would be returned.'' The five are <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, 36, a health care worker from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Doares </PERSON>, 33, a trade unionist from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, 43, a legal worker in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> law office of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>; <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Janda </PERSON>, 49, a photographer from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, 33, a student from <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The man authorities call <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' worst slumlord is believed to be a fugitive again after being inadvertently released from custody, officials said. <PERSON> Vijaynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Inglewood </LOCATION>, posted $ 20,000 bail in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> court and was freed Friday, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> city attorney's office. <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, captured last week by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, had disappeared in January while on bail pending sentencing in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for more than 100 housing-code violations. He failed to appear in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> courtroom Monday for an extradition hearing. The judge who released him on $ 20,000 bail apparently was unaware that <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> had outstanding warrants with bails totaling $ 2.65 million, officials said. The name of the judge was not immediately known, said <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, assistant chief of extradition in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> district attorney's office. Deputy City Attorney <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sautner </PERSON> said she `` was pretty surprised and a little angry'' when told of <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>'s disappearance. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had been holding <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> on a no-bail federal fugitive warrant. However, `` once he was turned over to local authorities, our warrant no longer applies,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kundts </PERSON>, special agent in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> office. `` We did n't feel he could be released on any bail,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. `` That was our understanding. It turns out that that was erroneous.'' <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> who once owned 18 tenement properties, was convicted last year of 112 misdemeanor housing-code violations involving five rat-infested residential buildings. City officials said it was the biggest slumlord case they had ever prosecuted. He also is a defendant in eight pending slumlord cases.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, touring this city where Hurricane Gilbert caused an estimated $ 35 million in damage, says he expects to get federal emergency assistance for the area. At least 41 tornadoes struck <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in the aftermath of Hurricane Gilbert, leaving hundreds of people without homes. Two <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> residents were among the more than 200 killed overall as the storm swept through the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Throughout south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 981 homes were damaged or destroyed by the hurricane and tornadoes, said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Stipkala </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. On Saturday, <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> asked the federal government to declare <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> a disaster area. He toured the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> on Monday. `` This is far worse than anything in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said. `` There is no place anywhere -LRB- in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- that suffered this kind of damage.'' The declaration would pave the way for assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and would enable businesses to receive low-interest loans from the Small Business Adminstration. It also could ultimately help homeless residents with temporary housing for a certain period, officials said. Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Bexar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> escorted <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> on the tour. Among the stops was an apartment complex where a twister early Saturday destroyed 120 units, damaged 260 units and left 300 people homeless. `` It's amazing to me that no one was killed,'' <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said as he climbed over bricks on a tour of The Lodge Apartments. <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> said city and county officials were assessing the damage and would try to get a report to <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> later this week. The governor said he would await that information before making the disaster request. `` The approval and certification of it being declared a disaster area can happen very quickly, but the individual payment will be slower than that,'' <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said. `` But the first step is to have it declared an emergency, and I do n't think we'll have any problem doing that.'' In contrast to the hard-hit <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> area, the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> may not need federal aid, officials there said. <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON> said his city suffered up to $ 800,000 in damage to mostly private property and the federal assistance might not be needed. <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ygnacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said the city spent thousands of dollars preparing and cleaning up after the storm. `` Whether it will meet the criteria for a true disaster, I do n't think so, or I'm not sure and really we're not too upset about that,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> City Manager <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Campriano </PERSON> said the storm caused about $ 100,000 in damage to city property, mostly road damage. In <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nueces </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luby </PERSON> said two beach parks suffered about $ 100,000 damage and he was considering a request for federal aid. Most of the damage in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, where residences at least $ 5 million in damage. A tornado that cut through <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> caused $ 28 million in damage to 12 buildings and aircraft parts. Another tornado destroyed the air-conditioning system at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, causing $ 2 million in damage.

 Presidential rivals <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are trying to impress a national television audience of potential voters this month between the dives and somersaults of the Summer Olympic Games. Both candidates are running advertisements during prime-time Olympic coverage on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The network is getting as much as $ 330,000 for 30 seconds of advertising time. A new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spot is called `` The Mission,'' featuring an excerpt from the vice president's acceptance speech last month at the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` I am a man who sees life in terms of missions. Missions defined and missions completed,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says in the excerpt. `` I will keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> moving forward, always forward. ... This is my mission. I will complete it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ad director, <PERSON> Sig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON>, said the 30-second spot was scheduled for a `` short run'' but other ads, including two attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on his environmental and crime-fighting records, would continue during the Olympics in various parts of the country. For his part, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was airing several Olympics spots in battleground states such as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. They depict the Democratic nominee as a responsible leader, an education advocate and an anti-crime governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The education spot, promising an affordable college education to anyone who wants one, dates from the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> primary and was added Tuesday night, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Voles </PERSON>. The other two ads are new and first aired last week. She said another new spot may be added by week's end. <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON> said Olympics viewers may start seeing ads tying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to the Carter presidency, which Republicans portray as a failure. The spots already have been produced. `` You could see some comparative commercials reflecting on the Carter years, the things that he did, the same outline for the future that comes from <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON> said.

 A major investors' service has reinstated <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>' bond rating, but efforts failed to bring together the two sides in the housing desegregation case that led to the city's financial problems <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it had reinstated the <ORGANIZATION> Baa </ORGANIZATION> rating on obligation bonds. The highest rating is Aaa. The rating was based on the security derived from the setting aside of property taxes, with the state comptroller as fiscal agent, for the purpose of meeting debts, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s said. City officials said $ 25.9 million was set aside. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s suspended the bond rating Aug. 4 due to uncertainties resulting from the daily fines imposed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> after the <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted to defy his housing desegregation order. Sand's initial fine of $ 100 had been due to double daily so that the city would have faced bankruptcy by mid-August. A federal appeals court later capped the fines at $ 1 million daily. Just as the fines hit the $ 1 million mark on Sept. 10, the council voted to pass a zoning ordinance related to the location of the affordable housing and bring itself into compliance with Sand's order <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> paid $ 819,100 in fines, $ 358,041 of which was given to the city schools. Sand had found the city liable for 40 years of segregating housing and schools in a 1985 landmark decision. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON>, who met with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, one of the plaintiffs in the original lawsuit, and the Save <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of groups battling the plan, said Monday that talks between the two sides broke off during the weekend. The federation issued a statement reiterating its plan to file a federal lawsuit concerning the case, without specifying the grounds or parties. In a statement, the coalition said, `` No housing, no sites, no units are acceptable to us anywhere in the city of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>.''

Destitute by choice after giving away most of their property, they have only $ 150 left, they said. `` We've got another two nights at the most,'' he said. `` We're just sort of stunned at this point She was generous to invite us into her home.

<HEAD>Israel Launches Vaccination Campaign After Polio Outbreak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> launched a vaccination campaign today after the polio virus found in sewage infected at least eight people with the disease, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced. Six cases of polio were confirmed in the town of <LOCATION> Hadera </LOCATION>, 28 miles north of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, health officials said. The victims include a 26-year-old teacher and a 3-month-old boy from the Or Akiva kibbutz and a teen-age boy from the <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Shemer </PERSON> collective farm. Two other cases were confirmed in the coastal towns of <LOCATION> Akko </LOCATION>, about 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION>, about 35 miles south. A <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said about 120,000 people would be vaccinated in the <LOCATION> Hadera </LOCATION> area, starting with infants and pre-schoolers. The outbreak caught <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by surprise. The European division of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, to which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> belongs, earlier this month considered declaring polio wiped out in the country. No polio cases were reported in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last year and only a single case was reported in 1986. Dr. <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Morag </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s advisory committee on contagious diseases, said that besides the eight confirmed cases, two more possible cases were under observation. He said health officials also were studying whether to expand the immunization campaign to other areas. <PERSON> Morag </PERSON> said the outbreak was caused by overflowing sewage and the fact that some people were not vaccinated against polio. He said `` massive amounts'' of the virus were detected in sewage in Or <PERSON> Akiva </PERSON> and the nearby Arab village of <LOCATION> Umm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El-Fahm </LOCATION>, both in the <LOCATION> Hadera </LOCATION> area. There have been no polio cases among Arab villagers but they have been included in the new immunization campaign, <LOCATION> Morag </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Morag </PERSON> said 95 percent of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> population already has been immunized against polio.

 A prosecutor who was once told her short skirts and designer blouses made her look like a `` bimbo'' has been fired for what her boss called professional shortcomings. <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> lost her $ 22,000 job as a <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assistant state attorney because of her handling of several drunken driving cases, her absence or tardiness from court and her failure to comply with paperwork, her supervisor said Monday. `` This is garbage,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 25. `` It just shows to what lengths they will go to get someone.'' Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> contended she was fired because of the complaint she filed last month with the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> against Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Countryman </PERSON>, one of her supervisors. In it, she charged him with discriminating against her for the clothes she wore _ designer styles rather than conservative, blue-gray suits. Countryman's problems with Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> were spelled out in five memos. `` I told her that her appearance in court in a short skirt created the impression that she was a bimbo interested only in meeting men,'' Countryman, 38, wrote in one memo. `` I stressed that she was not, but that, to outsiders, appearance was reality.'' On Aug. 5, supervisors warned Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> that her job performance during a six-month probationary period was unsatisfactory, and her probation was being extended a month. `` Since Aug. 5, nothing of a positive nature has occurred which would change the opinion of the administrators,'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, the office's chief assistant, said in the termination notice. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowenthal </PERSON>, a former assistant state attorney helping to defend Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, called the job performance criticisms absurd. He said he doubts any prosecutor has been fired for the same reasons. `` I knew it would probably have an effect on my career, but I'm a good lawyer and I know that my career as a lawyer will go on,'' Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the world's longest reigning monarch, received three blood transfusions today and was in stable condition after vomiting blood, imperial officials said. The Imperial Household Agency and other officials did not confirm a <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> report that the 87-year-old emperor appeared to be in critical condition this morning despite night-long treatment by a team of court physicians. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> attributed its report to an unidentified person who attended a Cabinet meeting this morning. It said a pre-dawn transfusion had not stopped a hemorrhage in his digestive tract. The imperial agency said no such announcement had been made. But in briefings later for Japanese reporters, <PERSON> Iwao </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyao </PERSON>, vice grand steward of the imperial agency, said doctors had given <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> 1.6 pints of blood during the night, then 0.4 pints more during the morning and 0.4 pints again during the afternoon. An <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official quoted <PERSON> Miyao </PERSON> as saying in a briefing at 9:30 p.m. `` I do n't think the emperor's condition is becoming worse, but rather that it is stabilizing.'' `` The emperor is in stable condition. He has a slight fever and is receiving intravenous drip,'' said palace spokesman <PERSON> Takenari </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugawara </PERSON>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s Cabinet was expected to approve plans Thursday to place Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, 54, in charge of state matters, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Kichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tazawa </PERSON> told reporters. The emperor's worsening health caused one former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> to cut short a trip to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and return home. At least one morning newspaper, the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, printed a single-page extra this afternoon. It bore the headline `` Ailing Emperor Vomits Some Blood'' and a photo of a jogger who paused to pray in front of the palace. In a briefing to palace reporters this afternoon, <PERSON> Miyao </PERSON> said the emperor would continue to receive blood and intravenous fluids, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said. Japanese news media mounted an intense watch on the imperial palace, in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, and reported the arrivals of a stream of well-wishers, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> said `` thank you'' to his son <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and the prince's wife, Crown Princess <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>. The emperor's death would plunge <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> into official mourning. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has occupied the Chrysanthemum Throne since 1926 and, after renouncing his divinity after World War II, is a figurehead with the constitutional role of `` symbol of state'' but no power. Older Japanese grew up revering him as the divine descendant of the sun goddess <ORGANIZATION> Amaterasu </ORGANIZATION> and still honor him highly, while younger people tend to have less interest in the imperial family. Marine biology is the emperor's passion. Indeed, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> is a widely respected authority on the subject, having written or co-authored at least 12 books on hydrozoa, or sea animals, his specialty. Late Monday, court physicians were summoned to the palace to treat the emperor, and early today <PERSON> Miyao </PERSON> told a news conference that the emperor had vomited blood _ a sign of hemorrhaging _ and the doctor had administered the first transfusion. The monarch was conscious through the procedure, <PERSON> Miyao </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has been frail since an intestinal bypass operation in September 1987 but he appeared in public for his 87th birthday on April 29 and on several later occasions. He and Empress <PERSON> Nagako </PERSON>, 85, spent most of the summer at an imperial villa outside <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, returning to the capital on Sept. 8. Since late summer, he has suffered from colds and fevers and a news report last week said he had lost 20 pounds of the 130 pounds he carried before his surgery.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s new law barring contracts that pay a surrogate mother to give up custody rights is constitutional, ruled a judge who said he still must decide whether a woman can be reimbursed for the costs of bearing a child for someone else. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> attorney general's office and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> agreed that surrogate arrangements are illegal if a mother is paid to give up her parental rights. That agreement enabled <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> to rule Monday on the law's constitutionality without listening to lengthy arguments. It's possible <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> could distinguish between a payment for giving up parental rights and a payment for the service of bearing a child. <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> promised to issue a further ruling within 30 to 60 days. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> believes the judge will interpret the law to mean it is OK to pay a woman for the service of carrying a child, so long as she was n't paid to give up custody. If the judge agrees, a woman who was artificially inseminated could keep the money and the baby, and the man whose sperm was used in the insemination would have to fight for custody of the child. After court, <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> confirmed that is the focus of the decision still before him. National Coalition Against Surrogacy Co-chair <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> called Monday's action a major victory because <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> was the first judge to rule on the constitutionality of criminal sanctions for surrogacy. `` That is crucial to us because we are in the process of moving legislation in legislatures across the country,'' he said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> attorney, is one of the nation's most prolific surrogacy specialists, claiming responsibility for 245 births, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s `` Baby M.'' <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> expressed confidence the contracts he has been arranging will be found to be legal. He typically makes $ 10,000 for arranging a birth. Women who agree to be artificially inseminated and then let the biological father raise the offspring earn the same amount. The infertile couple pays the medical costs. The new law, which took effect Sept. 1, calls for up to five years in prison and a $ 50,000 fine for brokers who make money by arranging surrogate births. Advertising or `` inducing'' a woman to bear a child for an infertile couple also became a felony. Under the law, women who enter into surrogacy contracts involving an exchange of money risk misdemeanor penalties of 90 days in jail and a $ 10,000 fine. The law did n't penalize arrangements involving no exchange of money, but the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> argued in a suit on behalf of surrogates and would-be parents that removing the payment for a woman's services effectively abolished surrogacy. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was the first state to approve criminal penalties for surrogate parent contracts. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> have enacted laws declaring such contracts illegal but do n't impose criminal penalties. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> does n't recognize as legal surrogacy contracts, and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> has barred enforcement of surrogate parenting contracts. A <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law criminalizing contracts and setting up regulations was passed after <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s, but took effect July 1. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> has legalized surrogacy.

 Police were seeking two masked men believed to be leftist extremists after shots were fired at a <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official near his home today, striking the man's car but missing him The attack on <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Tietmeyer </PERSON>, state secretary for the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, appeared to be an attempt to disrupt preparations for this month's meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said. Leftists say industrial nations are not doing enough to help poor countries. Police said <PERSON> Tietmeyer </PERSON> was driving to work in the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Godesberg </LOCATION> when his car was struck by gunfire. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said the attack occurred about 150 feet from <PERSON> Tietmeyer </PERSON>'s house. He said three shots were fired at the Mercedes. `` A shot hit the car, but <PERSON> Tietmeyer </PERSON> was uninjured,'' <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelke </PERSON> said. Two masked men were seen running from a nearby wooded area, according to <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>. Another police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a shotgun apparently was used in the attack. Police did not know whether more than one weapon was used. <PERSON> Tietmeyer </PERSON>'s driver, who was not identified, also escaped injury, police said. They said they were looking for the two men. `` This terrible incident appears to be connected with the upcoming World Bank-International Monetary Fund meeting,'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> told reporters. The finance minister said the 57-year-old <PERSON> Tietmeyer </PERSON> had been involved in planning for the annual World Bank-IMF meeting in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Sept 27-29. <PERSON> Tietmeyer </PERSON> is an expert on international finance and has accompanied Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> at world economic meetings.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has voted to adopt a policy allowing county hospital patients to refuse to be treated by people with the AIDS virus, but the hospital has not developed a way to make the policy work. The county board, which also serves as the hospital board of directors, voted 15-2 Monday to adopt the policy that would make the hospital the first in the nation to give patients that right, officials said. `` Our reaction is one of dismay,'' Dr. <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON>, a trustee of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said last week, after the board's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved the policy. `` There has been no case in this country of a patient contracting the AIDS virus from a health-care worker,'' <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON> said. No effective date was announced for the policy, which the hospital must still determine how to put into practice. The policy covers hospital workers who `` routinely provide direct patient care,'' including doctors and nurses. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's defenses against disease, leaving a person prey to life-threatening infections and certain cancers. AIDS has struck more than 72,000 people in this country since 1979 and killed more than 40,000 of them, according to the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The virus that causes the incurable and fatal disease is believed to be spread through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during birth.

 A car bomb exploded today in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, killing three people and wounding 25, destroying dozens of cars and touching off a fire, police and news reports said. Among those wounded was former Information Minister <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaff </PERSON> and three of his bodyguards. They were driving through the <LOCATION> Dora </LOCATION> district at the time of the 9 a.m. blast, officials said. A police spokesman, insisting on anonymity, said <PERSON> Skaff </PERSON>, a Christian paliamentarian, suffered cuts and burns but that neither he nor his companions were seriously injured. The other casualties were pedestrians, motorists or shopkeepers. Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the main radio station in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> run by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the bomb-laden automobile was parked near the <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> car dealership by a young man who escaped before it blew up. The radio station interrupted regular programming to report the explosion during the morning rush hour. It said 43 cars parked in the street were destroyed, most of them by a `` huge fire'' that burned many of the autos before being extinguished an hour later. The blast, so powerful it was heard across the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital, was the 13th car bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. By police count, 104 people have been killed and 378 wounded in previous attacks. Today's explosion took place an hour before <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> parliamentary deputies were scheduled to meet in <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to name a presidential candidate after vetoing a Syrian-American agreement to nominate deputy <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Daher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Skaff </PERSON>, a 50-year-old Greek Catholic, was en route to <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION> at the time. <PERSON> Daher </PERSON>, a pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, did not attend the meeting at the seat of the Maronites' patriarch, <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Wine, beer, champagne and cognac will be available in Soviet food stores, but the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> plans to continue sharp restrictions on the sale of vodka, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda said. The daily said Monday that the Cabinet, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, reviewed Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s 1985 anti-alcohol campaign that raised prices and the drinking age while cutting hours of liquor stores and the production of alcoholic beverages. `` Dry wines, champagne, cognac and beer ... are permitted to be sold in food stores and it was proposed to put an end to queues that humiliate human dignity,'' the Pravda report said. Muscovites say they have been able to buy champagne, expensive cognac and sometimes beer in some food stores throughout <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign to restrict alcohol sales. It was not immediately clear whether the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> intended to increase supplies to food stores, or stock them with cheaper, more popular beverages to end the long lines of Soviets at liquor stores. The policy governing the sale of distilled liquors, such as vodka, has not changed. Soviets who want to buy vodka still must shop at special stores only between 2-8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and buy only two bottles a person. Shortly before New Year's this year, a wave of letters and press commentaries critical of long lines for wine or champagne at liquor stores was published in the Soviet media. In response, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> permitted sales of non-distilled alcohol on grocery store shelves for the holiday period, but only for one week. Pravda said Monday that the measures <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> introduced more than three years ago, including cutting production of strong drink in half, reducing sales hours and closing some shops, had waged a successful war on drunkenness. `` It was noted at the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- meeting that appreciable success was received in liquidating alcoholism and hard drinking after adoption of the decree in 1985,'' the newspaper said. `` Drinking has been stopped at factories and plants as well as at other public places.'' Pravda said the anti-drink campaign had helped reduce crime and helped citizens `` to live and breathe more freely.'' But articles in Soviet papers have called the campaign excessive and said it mostly hurt the occasional drinker who wanted a bottle of champagne or wine for a holiday or family celebration. The crackdown also led to a surge in moonshining. The labor newspaper Trud reported in May that moonshiners were outproducing legal liquor manufacturers, and some articles have attributed recurring sugar shortages to moonshiners who use it in the distilling process. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kultura </ORGANIZATION> disclosed earlier this year that the anti-drinking campaign had shut down 70 percent of the 50,000 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> liquor shops that had been operating since May 1985. Last November, Pravda reported there were 4.5 million diagnosed alcoholics in the country and millions of others who have avoided detection or treatment.

<HEAD>Court Order To Clean Up Air Could Mean Lifestyle Changes,
Officials Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A court order that takes the first step toward cleaning up <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s polluted air could lead to stronger auto emission controls and a reduction in the number of freeway commuters, officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hupp </PERSON> on Monday ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to draft a plan to reduce pollution in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> counties. <PERSON> Hupp </PERSON>'s order was expected after the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged in July that it is required by federal law to take over smog control enforcement in the basin after the local air quality management district missed a deadline for meeting ozone and carbon monoxide health standards. The order does n't set a deadline for <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s plan. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times they hope <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will extend compliance deadlines before the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is forced to impose stringent restrictions on the area. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the agency is legally required to draft a plan that would reduce smog by 1993. That five-year deadline would require curtailing rush-hour traffic. `` I think 20 years is by far the more realistic time frame, and even with that, it will require tremendous change on everybody's part, and even new technology to accomplish it,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said But he said, `` the law wo n't let me go beyond five years.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization, along with the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, believes that a five-year deadline would force such strict control measures that the public would oppose it. He said the environmental groups hoped for a 12 - to 15-year plan The basin has some of the worst air in the country despite auto emissions standards and controls over industrial polluters.

<TEXT>
 The Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is putting its members to work in the fight against hunger, hoping they will collect 100 million cans of food for the needy in a door-to-door campaign this fall. `` Hunger is a problem we can do something about by working together,'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Love </PERSON>, chief executive of the Scouts, said Monday at a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> news conference. The `` Scouting for Food'' program calls for Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Explorers to go to homes in the next two months and drop off bags. A few weeks later, the bags will be collected and the cans of food distributed to various relief agencies. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> will be aiding the effort. Many others, like food chains, civic and religious groups, fire departments and various local agencies, also are cooperating. `` It is an example of scouting's long-standing commitment to community service,'' Love said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is the volunteer chairman of the food drive.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> proposed today that the federal government require employers to provide minimum health insurance coverage for all American workers, which his campaign said would provide benefits to about 22 million people who have none. Underscoring his emphasis on health issues, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor campaigned at a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> medical center with visits to two clinics. He was to present his health insurance plan in a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in Bowling Green, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Hermann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democrtic </ORGANIZATION> nominee sat with a dozen selected patients and family members in the waiting room of a cancer ward and asked each in turn about medical costs and health insurance problems `` I think it's time we did something,'' he said. `` It's getting worse ...'' `` If all goes well on the 8th of November, Sen. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I are going to do something about it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Spread the word.'' His campaign issued a statement saying that as president, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would propose legislation that would require all employers to provide basic health plans for their workers, with special provisions for small and start-up businesses. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' health adviser, Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said the campaign had no estimate of what the proposal would cost employers. The statement said it would not cost the federal government anything. The statement also said that if elected, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would appoint a task force to report by March 30, 1989, on follow-up legislation that would guarantee universal health coverage, thus extending benefits to every American, working or not. <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said 37 million to 40 million Americans are without health insurance. He said the initial <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plan would guarantee coverage to about two-thirds of them by requiring that employers provide insurance or risk civil penalties. The other one-third would be covered under the second-step universal health plan. The follow-up plan for all Americans presumably would require some federal financing, but the campaign was silent on that question. Details apparently would be worked out by the task force. <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said the proposed national plan was patterned after a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> system not yet six months old, which is to provide health care coverage to every state resident by 1992. The prospective cost of that system is a topic of debate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> estimated net cost at about $ 623 million through 1992; some critics say it would be twice that much. The stress on health care was part of the campaign effort to take control of the political agenda, and choose topics instead of replying to Republican political offensives. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> punctuated it with a daylong offensive against his Republican rival. Campaigning with his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he wondered what might have happened during the past eight years if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had chosen a vice president `` strong enough to think for himself and speak up for himself.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he chose <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> because he did n't want a yes man but a strong man who would ` speak his mind and make a difference. ` `` We have n't had that kind of vice president'' in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Campaigning in Little Rock Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told an invited audience of about 800 that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for a reduction in the capital gains tax is `` a warmed-over call to selfishness.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vision is of `` a complacent <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that wants to look backward.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added that even Republicans realize four more years of Reaganomics would be bad, `` and four more years of Reaganomics without <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be a disaster.'' At a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> forum sponsored by representatives of the depressed oil industry, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of changing his tune on energy policy, promising to stop offshore drilling when in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, supporting it when in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is like a coin,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told an audience of about 1,000 at the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> Monday night. `` They just flip him. Sometimes he lands on his head. Sometimes he lands on his tail.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> appeared together at a closed-door fund-raising dinner at a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> hotel. At the energy forum, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was jeered for declining to appear, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised to pay premiums or provide tax incentives to purchase domestic oil and promote oil and gas drilling. He did not estimate the cost or say how it would be financed. He also said that as president he would convene a `` bipartisan energy summit'' with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as chairman, to design a comprehensive energy policy.

 Vandals carved racial slurs on doors and splashed paint on an entry-way floor at the home of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s first black congressman since Reconstruction, who is running for a second term this fall An upset <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> took time off from his 2nd District campaign today to repair the damage to his home in this town a few miles north of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Sure, it makes you angry,'' he said. `` We've come a long way in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, but cases like this remind you how far we've got to go.'' <PERSON> Espy </PERSON>, a Democrat who faces Republican <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> in November, said his major concern was for his family. `` I'm the congressman. I have the record and I have my performance to defend and I can defend it,'' <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> said. `` I'm the congressman, not my wife, my brother or my children.'' <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> said his wife discovered the vandalism when she returned home with her children late Monday. `` My son is 5 and my daughter is 8 and I had to explain to them the history of race relations in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` They had carved the word ` Nigger' on two doors and I had to tell my children what that meant and why somebody would do that. It was not an easy thing to do. `` If someone wants to come after me, let them come, but I want them to leave my family alone.'' The congressman said the racial slurs were carved on doors in the covered entry-way leading into the house and a garage area. He said the letters were cut into the doors near the top, along with `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Con'' _ apparently referring to congressman. He said plants in the entry-way had been uprooted and paint dashed on the floor and on some of the plants. <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> said both doors were locked when his family arrived, and there apparently had been no attempt get inside. He said police were called and were investigating. Madison Police Chief <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON> said his officers had filed a report on the vandalism and an investigation was under way. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, called for a full investigation of the incident. `` I hope this campaign does not degenerate into that level of activity,'' he said. `` I think <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> has gone a long way in erasing a negative image it has had outside the state. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> has been a good congressman for this state and he has done a whole lot to improve <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s image,'' he said. `` I hope we are not going to allow a few narrow-minded people to take us back to a period we have gone through.'' <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> said he had received threatening calls in the past, `` but you always expect those. There has not been an increase in those calls, and this is the first time something like this has happened.'' `` I think most Mississippians would be upset to hear something like this has happened,'' he added, `` but we all realize there are still some ignorant people running around. We also realize that in public life, we are prone to attack.''

 Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil country, said today that on energy policy the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` has drilled a real dry hole.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> reiterated presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' promise to take government action to revive the petroleum industry. One day earlier, in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> outlined his energy program before an audience of oil producers, saying he would support government intervention if necessary to keep domestic wells in operation. Today in <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters, `` Five out of six rigs that were active in 1981 are idle today. Two out of every five jobs in the oil industry have been lost.'' Standing in front of a rig hauled to the airport for the event, with a huge <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag as a backdrop, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> pointed to the equipment as `` a sign of what's happened to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' `` That piece of equipment should n't be here at the airport, it should be out there working in the field,'' he said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will tell you he's an oilman, but when it comes to an energy policy this administration has drilled a dry hole. It's a real duster,'' he said. A day earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would name <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to head a bipartisan energy summit as soon after the election as possible, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` With each passing month, we are becoming more vulnerable to another oil embargo. At the rate we're going, by 1995, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be 60 percent dependent on foreign oil.'' The energy summit is the second panel or commission to which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he would appoint the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator if the Democratic ticket is elected. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has also said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would head a council on the space program, which like oil has a definite interest for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> voters. The polls in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> show the Democratic ticket trailing slightly in the race for the state's 29 electoral votes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a message <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was to carry around the state today, slammed Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for doing nothing for the oil industry as vice president. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s failure to appear at the People for an Energy Policy forum, to which both tickets were invited, was indicative. `` A former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman, and yet he does n't have time to engage in a discussion of energy,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, accusing him in his adopted home state of ignoring the important issues of the campaign. `` My friends, we do n't need any more speeches about the flag,'' he said. `` We need a president and vice president who are concerned about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s energy future, and yours.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that at the same time energy demand has increased, the domestic industry's production has gone down since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office. `` The last eight years in the energy industry have been a roller coaster ride with the bottom knocked out.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised to remove barriers that have been blocking increased use of natural gas in the country, to increase the filling of the government's strategic oil reserve, and to boost research on making oil fields more productive. He also promised to `` make <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> the EOR -LRB- enhanced oil recovery -RRB- capital of the world,'' referring to techniques for extracting more oil from a seemingly depleted well, and said his program would help the oil industry more directly if necessary to keep wells from shutting down. `` And when the market alone wo n't provide the incentive to drill, a government led by <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has made a career in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fighting on the side of the oil industry. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator would be chairman of `` a bipartisan energy summit just as soon after the election as possible.'' The group would `` design a comprehensive energy policy'' to make sure producers and consumers had fair prices, he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speech made no mention of alternative energy sources such as nuclear power or ethanol `` Unlike either <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has been a leader in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of his running mate, who was seated nearby. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor listed <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s accomplishments _ and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s votes against the oil industry `` Those votes say a lot about Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' he said. `` And they say a lot about the man who selected him.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who introduced <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to the gathering of several hundred oil industry people from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and neighboring states, said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had `` sentenced the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> to a deep and painful recession.'' `` I know a lot of my friends in the energy business tend to vote Republican,'' he said. `` But I want to ask them: What has this administration done to help your industry through the toughest period in history?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said, was the first of the Democrats to support repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil and was not, as Republicans claimed, opposed to all offshore drilling.

 A doctor who claims she contracted the AIDS virus after being accidentally pricked by a discarded needle in a hospital patient's bedding is suing the hospital, the city and two other doctors for $ 175 million. In papers filed Friday in trial-level state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Prego </PERSON>, 30, claims she was infected in January 1983 at <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. The syringe needle had been used to draw blood from an AIDS patient, she said. At the time, Prego, a native of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and a graduate of a medical school there, was working as an unsalaried aide to a hospital intern, Dr. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, who is one of the defendants. Prego alleges that <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, who was treating the AIDS patient, `` negligently and improperly'' put three discarded needles on the patient's bedding _ one of which stuck Prego as she was cleaning up. She charges that <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, and later hospital officials, assured her they did n't know of any cases `` where a health care worker contracted AIDS by means of a needle stick.'' Such contamination recently has been shown to be possible. Prego also claims that the city's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> did not supply any puncture-resistant disposal units for the contaminated syringes and needles. The suit also names <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Landsman </PERSON>, a doctor who had conducted a state-sponsored survey of health and hospital employees working with patients suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome. She said <PERSON> Landsman </PERSON> violated her right to confidentiality by informing hospital administrators about her condition. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabel </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the city, the <ORGANIZATION> HHC </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, said her clients have denied all substantive charges. She declined to comment further. The state attorney general's office, which is representing <PERSON> Landsman </PERSON>, also declined to comment.

 On his last day in office, Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> today praised the tradition of strong local control in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> schools and downplayed the importance of kindergarten for youngsters. `` It would be a shame for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to veer toward state control of education when we are telling other states to emulate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said at a news conference.

Average scores for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> students were tops nationally among the 22 states in which 40 percent or more of the students took the tests, which are widely used in college admissions. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who appeared at the news conference with Republican gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, was asked to comment on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s status as the only state not to require kindergarten and <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s opposition to state-mandated kindergarten. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> did not answer directly, but said, `` There is no research that conclusively proves that kindergarten gives kids a jump. `` Yes, kindergarten is desireable,'' he said, `` but a good first, second and third grade is more important than a good kindergarten.'' He added: `` No one suggests that <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s education system is perfect. The general decline in education seen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, more than many other states, is on the right track'' trying to reverse the trend. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> went from <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, where he was to briefly teach reading and speak to an assembly at the <ORGANIZATION> Hollis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, one of 287 winners nationwide in the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s school recognition program He was also scheduled to go to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> today for his last official appearance as education secretary. Afterward, he planned to go hiking in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>.

 A report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> called the growing number of homeless children `` a national disgrace,'' yet was issued without its authors' strongest recommendations and criticism of government failures, one participant said today. While the academy published the bulk of the report, it declined to include detailed recommendations. `` Those who served on the panel ... were a little disturbed that we were not able to go into more detail on the problems of the homeless and some of the corrective measures that should be taken,'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer and panel member, said today. But Dr. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, of the academy's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the report, termed the recommendations `` not sufficiently scholarly and documented to be included.'' The additional comments were included in a supplemental statement released today by <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, who headed the 13-member study group. <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON> said the published report `` does n't adequately convey our sense of outrage and dismay at the phenomenon of homelessness.'' The official academy study portrays a homeless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> filled not only with alcoholics and former mental patients but with growing numbers of children and families scraping out a dismal existence in rural communities. The study, ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, estimates that on any given night families with a total of 100,000 children are homeless, while yet more children have run away or been kicked out by their parents. The 242-page report says children under 18 are the fastest growing group among the nation's homeless and says this is `` nothing short of a national disgrace that must be treated with the urgency that such a situation demands.'' The only indication of the panel's stronger position comes in a five-line footnote which says members of the committee `` unanimously wish to express their strong feeling that the recommendations are too limited in addressing the broader issues of homelessness _ especially the supply of low-income housing, income maintenance, the availability of support services, and access to health care for the poor and uninsured.'' Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, blocked publication of a supplemental statement signed by 10 of the panel members. He was quoted in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today as saying he did so because `` the language was charged and polemical and emotional.'' He said the academy has the obligation to `` stick to the data and minimize the intrusion of values as much as possible.'' The published report's recommendations include a list of largely noncontroversial proposals covering eligibility standards, training and program expansions. The report calls, for instance, for improved day care and Head Start programs and efforts to make homeless parents aware of the help available for their children. It recommends that food stamps be allowed to be used in restaurants so people who do n't have kitchens can use them to save money. But deleted, said <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON>, were calls for restoring a 70 percent cut in low-income housing support since 1981, new treatments services for the mentally ill and substance abusers, and an increase in the minimum wage to make adequate housing affordable. The study did include, however, an appendix which blamed the growing number of rural homeless on the failure of government policymakers to recognize the extent of the rural economic crisis. Farm foreclosures, foreign competition that has wiped out low-wage rural manufacturing jobs and the downturn in energy industries have bred increased rural poverty and homelessness, says the report by consultant <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>. The report said there are no national studies pinning down the numbers of homeless children, but it uses the most conservative of several estimates to conclude that each night at least 100,000 children are in families that must resort to streets, organized shelters or makeshift quarters. It cites estimates of the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a homeless advocacy group, that there are 735,000 homeless on any given night and concludes that at least a quarter of them are members of families and 55 percent of the family members are children. It also cites research by the group indicating that 1.3 million to 2 million people will be homeless for one night or more in the course of a year. The study acknowledges that accurate statistics on the homeless are difficult to find. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that it will make a special effort in 1990 to count the homeless. On March 20 of that year, census takers will visit emergency shelters from 6 p.m. to midnight and street locations where the homeless often congregate between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. During 10 months of research, the committee and its staff visited agencies serving the homeless in 11 cities _ <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ and rural areas in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 94-0 today to confirm <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> as education secretary after members called the son of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cattleman an `` authentic American success story'' who is committed to federal education programs. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, who was scheduled to be sworn in later this afternoon at the White House, will be the first Hispanic member of a president's <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. `` He is an authentic American success story and an inspiration to millions of young students,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass.

<HEAD>Dukakis Outlines Health Insurance Plan; Bush Visits Flag Factory</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates in top 6 grafs with Bush at flag plant, Dukakis in
Houston, picking up in 5th graf pvs, In advance</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought support among working people and their families today by proposing requirements that all Americans be covered by health insurance. Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited a flag factory and said, `` I want to build an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that inspires.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a rally outside the <LOCATION> Annin </LOCATION> flag company in <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, `` My mission is simple: To build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. That simple and that big.'' Inside, he told plant workers, `` Today the flags you make still inspire Americans and those who love our values the world over.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said repeatedly in recent appearances that the flag manufacturer has thrived during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, contending that flag sales reflect a patriotic revival during the Republicans' White House tenure. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Monday that `` we do n't need more speeches about the flag'' and then unveiled his broad health-insurance proposal today. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor opened his campaign day with stops at a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> medical center and two clinics, asking patients and family members about medical costs and health insurance problems and saying, `` I think it's time we did something. It's getting worse.'' He was to spell out details of the health plan during a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in Bowling Green. In advance, his campaign issued a statement saying that as president, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would propose legislation to require all employers to provide basic health plans for their workers _ a plan aimed at providing benefits to about 22 million people who now have none. The statement also said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, if elected, would appoint a task force to report by March 30, 1989, on follow-up legislation to guarantee universal health coverage, thus extending benefits to every American, working or not. That follow-up plan for all workers presumably would require some federal financing, but the campaign was silent on that question. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' health adviser, said 37 million to 40 million Americans have no health insurance. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' emphasis on health care was part of an effort to take control of the political discussion rather than merely replying to allegations by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Continuing attacks he began last week on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' tenure as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> luncheon in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> on Monday that the Democratic nominee had an `` anti-business scheme.'' He said business bankruptcies in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> rose 23.7 percent during the first six months of the year while the national rate had fallen 23.5 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of running a divisive campaign, `` with a calculated strategy of emphasizing differences between rich and poor, between one region of the country and another.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> campaigned in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on Monday, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would support government intervention if necessary to keep domestic oil wells operating. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said he would appoint <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who has made a congressional career of helping the oil industry, to a bipartisan energy summit. Accusing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of changing his position on offshore drilling to suit his campaign needs _ supporting it in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and opposing it in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the audience of about 1,000: `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is like a coin. They just flip him. Sometimes he lands on his head. Sometimes he lands on his tail.'' Just as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, Republican running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record on the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> economy during appearances in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and Casper, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. Charging that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` created an economic manacle'' in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, he said the state ranks 40th out of 50 states in total employment growth and 45th in manufacturing job growth. It actually lost 90,000 manufacturing jobs between June 1984 and January 1988, he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also went after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on what the Republicans contend is his election-year conversion to a tougher defense. `` In just a week his defense policy went from general confusion to General <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>,'' he said. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign swiftly countered the claims made by both Republican candidates about the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> economy, bringing out eight business leaders in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to respond. `` My company has grown and prospered under the leadership of Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said one of them, <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter. `` He created the atmosphere that made it possible for us to grow.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said leading members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would be called on to rebut some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> charges while <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> business and industry leaders would address <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> comments about the state economy. Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were limiting their campaign schedule this week in order to prepare for Sunday's debate in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. Despite the approaching encounter, the sides have not agreed on who will ask the questions. A Media General-Associated Press poll, meanwhile, said Americans see <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as more compassionate and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as more competent, but are n't convinced that either candidate can accomplish most of his goals as president. Only 36 percent of those surveyed said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could accomplish most of his goals as president, and just 31 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could achieve most of his goals. Nearly half said either would be stymied. The rest were not sure. A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> poll in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading 43-39, and one in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ahead 48-42, but the four-point margin of error in each poll made the leads meaningless. A poll in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a 49-34 lead. The poll by <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> had a five-point margin of error.

 Coup leader <PERSON> Gen </PERSON>. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> formed a military-dominated government today and the official media reported his troops killed 59 people, most of them in clashes with looters. One witness reported gunfire in downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> tonight. On Monday, troops shot and killed at least 100 people in quelling widespread opposition to <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s rule. More than 200 people have been reported killed since he seized power Sunday. Opposition leaders issued a joint statement calling for talks with <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> to resolve the crisis. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> was both the defense and foreign affairs ministers in the new government. He was defense minister and armed forces commander when he seized power Sunday from civilian President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. No president or prime minister was named today, and there was no word on <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s fate. Only one of the nine <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers named was a civilian, Minister of Health Pe <PERSON> Thein </PERSON>. At least six ministers were among the 18 senior officers who mounted the coup with <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. The broadcast said the military commanders in each of the country's seven states and seven divisions also would serve as the top government representatives in those areas. Troops on Monday shot and killed at least 100 people protesting the coup and the two sides battled late into the night. Some protesters hurled gasoline bombs at troops who fired back. State radio reported five incidents today in which security forces killed looters and other civilians. Troops dispersed a crowd of 50 people looting a warehouse eight miles north of downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> at 4 a.m., killing eight people, the radio said. Sixteen people died when troops tried to stop more than 200 people from looting a warehouse in the Thamaing campus of <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, it said. Security forces shot and killed 16 people looting the <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> head office in downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in the early morning, and five people died as troops broke up looting at a biscuit factory in the northern part of the capital, the radio said. Troops killed another 14 people when a military truck on patrol in east <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> was attacked, it said. Witnesses reported one person was shot and killed as soldiers halted looting at a market in the city. Sporadic clashes also were reported in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> but no details were available. Telephone communications were out after the communications department's microwave dish was damaged in the morning, reportedly by some kind of rocket. Bloody protests and general strikes began Aug. 8, toppling hard-line President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> four days later. Today, military trucks rolled down <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s streets with loudspeakers warning soldiers would shoot anyone building barricades, an Asian diplomat in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> speaking on condition of anonymity said. People hurried home after buying food at the few small shops that were open. Three key opposition leaders issued a statement today condemning the bloodshed and telling coup leaders that `` such suppression by force of arms will not stop the people's just demand for democracy.'' They demanded talks with <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> `` to seek ways to correctly solve the current crisis.'' The statement was issued by former Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, former Defense Minister Tin Oo and <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, daughter of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s late independence leader In the statement, they also rebuffed offers from the country's ethnic insurgents to support the pro-democracy demonstrations, and told authorities to stop spreading rumors that the rebels had infiltrated the demonstrations The top <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks organization also issued a statement appealing for dialogue between the two sides. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> overthrew <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who took over Aug. 19 as <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader since the 1962 military coup. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> had ended martial law and withdrawn soldiers from the streets as a concession to protesters. But the opposition demanded that he allow an interim government conduct the democratic elections he had promised. Troops returned in force after Sunday's coup by <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who said he took over to halt <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s social chaos and ensure the elections were held. On Monday, soldiers enforcing <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s ban on public gatherings shot monks, students, government workers and other unarmed demonstrators. Reporters conservatively estimated at least 100 dead. About 40 demonstrators and 17 soldiers died in clashes Sunday. Some diplomats suggested <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power to save the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the target of months of widespread street protests. Protesters blame the country's sole legal party for 26 years of repression and economic ruin. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has been in turmoil since students rioted last September against government economic policies. Security forces killed scores of protesters in March and June, and demonstrations since July have forced the resignations of longtime strongman <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> and his successor, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who lasted 17 days. At least 112 people died in the rioting against <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Soldiers from two more army units ousted their commanders today in a spreading revolt begun three days earlier when Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> seized power in a coup, radio stations reported. At least three people were killed in the streets during the night, the stations said. Nine other people have been reported killed in the past two days. After a night of gunfire and violence in the streets of this sprawling capital, non-commissioned officers and enlisted men of the downtown fourth company arrested their commander, Maj. <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON> <PERSON> Symbert </PERSON>, and deposited him unharmed in front of the downtown army headquarters, the radio stations said. The stations said gunfire was heard at the army compound in <LOCATION> Mirebalais </LOCATION>, about 25 miles northwest of the capital as soldiers mutinied against their commander, Lt. <PERSON> Simeon </PERSON> <PERSON> Francois </PERSON>. The lieutenant fled. On Monday, troops of the elite 300-man <ORGANIZATION> Leopards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> handcuffed their leader, Col. <PERSON> Abelard </PERSON> <PERSON> Denis </PERSON>, to the entrance of army headquarters. Firing automatic weapons triumphantly into the air, they sped in vehicles back to their compound near the wealthy suburb of <LOCATION> Petionville </LOCATION>. Soldiers of the 160-man <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> also briefly detained their commander Monday before expelling him from their base in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, previously army adjutant general, proclaimed himself president Sunday after a coup ousted Lt. <PERSON> Gen </PERSON> <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, who ran <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> for most of the 2 -LCB- years since <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> was forced into exile in February 1986. Radio reports said police detective <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> was shot and killed, as were three unidentified brothers of Commander <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavannes </PERSON> of the traffic police. Gunshots filled the air all night and into the early hours today. A government official, who asked not to be identified, blamed the violence on `` uncontrollable elements.'' Gunmen cruised the streets firing into the air. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s new military government issued a communique Monday calling on the populace to remain calm and not seek vengeance. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> told the nation he had appointed a mostly civilian Cabinet that would ensure a transition to democracy, but made no mention of plans for free elections. The new military ruler announced during an installation ceremony carried Monday by state-run television that he had named 11 civilians and one army officer to the Cabinet `` for the definitive installation of democracy.'' `` We have our minds set on rising above parties and rival factions to attain national reconciliation,'' <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said. But opposition leaders have been skeptical of the new government. Radio stations earlier reported that mobs on Monday killed three suspected members of the <PERSON> Tonton </PERSON> <PERSON> Moucoutes </PERSON>, a feared band of thugs who were loyal to the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family dictatorship that ruled for 29 years until <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON>'s departure. The stations said the killings apparently were in reprisal for a Sept. 11 church massacre in which unidentified hoodlums killed 13 people and wounded 77. Six other such mob killings were reported Sunday. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Degraff </PERSON>, the government's assistant information officer, said a realignment of the army would be announced shortly and would involve the transfer, promotion and retirement of an unspecified number of army officers. A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the high command appeared to be delaying the military reshuffle to assert its authority over the non-commissioned officers who led the coup. Sources said that despite initial reports to the contrary, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, commander of the dreaded 700-man <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION>, would not be elevated to armed forces commander in chief. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has been indicted on drug charges by a federal court in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Degraff </PERSON> identified the army officer appointed to the new Cabinet as Col. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorfainville </PERSON>, who was named interior and defense minister, replacing Maj.

 Firefighters working double shifts today battled a wind-fanned arson blaze to the edge of this city as flames destroyed seven homes, scorched more than 18,000 acres and forced 500 people to flee. But in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, firefighters were sent home as cool, moist fall weather helped them get a handle on the blazes that have blackened hundreds of thousands of acres. Fifteen fires burning Monday had charred 1.39 million acres in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, where the firefighting is coordinated. In all this season, 69,099 fires have blackened 4,140,000 acres, including about 2 million acres in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, he said. In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, gusty wind combined with higher temperatures to stir up two major blazes. The arson fire grew to 18,000 acres and jumped a containment line late Monday outside <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION>, about 55 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. It reached within a third of a mile of town, said fire captain <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. Authorities established a new line today along a 10-mile stretch of road, along which the 500 residents were ordered to evacuate, said fire captain <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>. `` We're leaving,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 33, one of <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION>'s 61,000 residents `` Staying around would be stupid.'' <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> said firefighters were optimistic about holding the blaze. `` If today goes well for us, we should have 100 percent containment Thursday,'' he said. Officials predicted that afternoon wind could push the blaze toward scattered homes to the west of the fire line at the western edge of town. Along Interstate 80, the glow from the fire could be seen 13 miles away, from <PERSON> Cordelia </PERSON>. Thick smoke drifted through downtown <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION>. The fire started Saturday north of <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION> is one of two major <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> blazes that have destroyed 15 homes as they roared across 26,000 acres of wildland, brush and timber. At the 8,000-acre fire near <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Shasta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, two men clearing burned timber suffered head and back injuries Monday when a tree fell on them, officials said. Both were hospitalized in critical condition, officials said. Officials said that fire was caused when someone apparently target shooting shot out an insulator from a powerline about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>, 220 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and the sparks ignited the drought-dry brush. Eighty firefighters were left today to mop up at <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s only remaining major forest fire, a 34,500-acre blaze in Glacier National Park. `` I think fire season is just about over here,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Madelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kempf </PERSON> said, adding it had rained through most of the night. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, Yellowstone National Park officials released 1,000 soldiers who were in the park for more than 30 days battling the flames that involved half the 2.2 million-acre park. Officials also started to release employees of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. Cooler conditions, shorter days and higher humidities helped limit fire activity. The <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION> fire destroyed seven homes, 10 outbuildings and $ 7 million worth of telecommunications equipment, officials said. Although no incendiary device was recovered in <LOCATION> Miller </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, where most of the destroyed homes were located, arson was suspected, said <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>. Three other blazes began in the area since Saturday but they have been contained, officials said. Crews fighting the Redding fire reported progress with 60 percent of the blaze contained. Crews were expected to encircle the blaze tonight and bring it under control by Wednesday evening, forestry officials say. Six homes and six other structures were burned on Sunday and about 300 people were evacuated, but authorities said they were allowed to return to home Monday. Lower temperatures in the 60s and 70s, 30 percent to 35 percent humidity and 5 mph winds helped the 920 firefighters working to build 5.5 miles of line around the fire, authorities said. Firefighters also used 85 engines, seven helicopters, eight airtankers, and 31 water tankers in their effort, estimating fire suppression costs at $ 400,000.

<HEAD>Independence Referendum For Western Sahara Annnounced</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Security Council unanimously voted today to approve an independence referendum for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, where Marxist guerrillas haven been battling <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s occupation forces for 13 years. The 15-0 <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> vote approved the appointment of a special representative of the secretary-general to monitor a referendum that would result in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>'s independence or affiliation with <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> reminded the members of the council that on Aug. 30, representatives of the Polisario independence movement and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> met with him in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to approve the referendum and peace plan, with certain reservations. `` The proposals aimed at the restoration of peace in the region provide a framework for the conclusion of a cease-fire and the establishment of conditions necessary for the organization of a credible referendum,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief. `` The referendum will be organized and monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in cooperation with the Organization of African Unity,'' he said. The organization has played a major role in arranging the dialogue between Polisario and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said a special representative from his office, a civilian unit, a military unit and a security unit would work for peace in the area. `` The proposals also provide that the Kingdom of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> will carry out an appropriate, substantial and gradual reduction of its troops in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahra </LOCATION>,'' with remaining soldiers to be barracked under the supervision of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers. Polisario's fighters would also be quartered under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision. The Marxist-led Polisario movement of about 8,000 fighters has been battling for the independence of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s colonial administration withdrew in 1975-76, and Moroccan occupation troops took over the phosphate-rich desert territory in northwest <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> More than 10,000 people have died in the nearly 13-year-old guerrilla war, which has cost <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> up to $ 2 million a day to fight. <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> covers about 110,000 square miles. Its population was set at 76,000 in 1974, during the last Spanish colonial census. Under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan, only people born in the territory may vote in the referendum. Determining who is eligible will be a major chore for the referendum monitors. Polisario claims about 165,000 eligible Western Saharans live in its refugee camps near <LOCATION> Tindouf </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, which funds and shelters Polisario, but <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> says they are not eligible. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> claims that 90 percent of the 150,000 residents of Moroccan-occupied sections of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> are eligible, but <PERSON> Polisario </PERSON> says two-thirds of them are Moroccan immigrants.

 A space official said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s first satellite was performing better than expected, and he denied reports the craft is carrying cameras to spy on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations `` I am very enthusiastic about the excellent results,'' <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortas </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` Everything is going according to calculations, even better.'' The launch Monday, which made <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> the eighth nation to place a satellite in space, provoked sharp protests from Arab neighbors. A state-run newspaper in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s main enemy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of helping launch the satellite and said it would threaten the Arab world. `` As part of the -LRB- Israeli-U.S. -RRB- strategic alliance, the enemy launched a spy satellite with the help of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... for military purposes. This is a new threat to the Arab nation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Tishrin </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, denied the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had any involvement in the launch. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials say they are unsure what is in the satellite's payload. `` We're leaning toward more of an experimental communications package as opposed to a true spy satellite,'' said one source who demanded anonymity. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said the satellite gave <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` a serious strategic leverage'' since the country already had the capability to fire long-range missiles. The Libyan news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, described the craft as a `` spy satellite -LRB- and part of a -RRB- psychological war being carried out by the Zionists against the Arab nation.'' Newspaper editorials in other Arab capitals urged Arabs to pool resources to match <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s technological advances. <PERSON> Ortas </PERSON> denied claims the 340-pound test satellite, named Horizon I, was carrying surveillance equipment. `` We are n't getting pictures. We do n't have anything to get pictures from. There is no means to get pictures,'' said <PERSON> Ortas </PERSON>, vice president of the electronics division of the agency that launched the satellite. A spokesman for the London-based magazine <ORGANIZATION> Jane </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> said the satellite was carrying a 6.6-pound payload for surveillance purposes, apparently for monitoring activity in Arab countries. Because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is not thought to have the capability of installing sophisticated surveillance equipment in a satellite, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> optical equipment was believed to be aboard, the spokesman added. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s reporter with close ties to the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military, said the satellite was unlikely to provide much useful surveillance because of the direction of its orbit. `` It only gets two decent passes in any 24-hour period over Arab countries and one of these is during darkness which means no sight capability except, perhaps, by infrared light, which is not as good,'' <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> said. `` It's very chancey it's going to see anything at all,'' he said in an interview Monday from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Israeli officials said the craft was expected to stay aloft for a month. Development of the craft came after more than 20 years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> space research and was seen as part of the country's effort to become independent in the defense field. Until now, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has relied on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to provide satellite pictures, but some former Israeli officials have complained the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was stingy in supplying intelligence information. In March 1987, former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison for selling <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military documents. Israeli media have quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources as saying the documents <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> delivered included satellite pictures of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> weapons and storage facilities. A recent source of possible concern to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is deploying Chinese-built, CSS-2 missiles 285 miles south of <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>. Satellite photographs displayed by <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a private Swedish company, showed the Saudis were expanding an airstrip and a military complex to accommodate the new weapons. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON>, a retired head of military intelligence, said earlier this week that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would save money on reconnaisance flights by conventional aircraft and drones. <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON> said another benefit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of having its own satellite was they pose fewer political problems than surveillance aircraft or pilotless planes.

<HEAD>Rumors of Cult Hearings Die Down, Students Return to Class</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE with attendance normal today</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attendance returned to normal today at <ORGANIZATION> Caldwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where students had been kept from class by parents worried about rumors that a satanic cult planned to come to school and kill people. About 350 youths _ two-thirds of the student body _ left school in a `` panic'' Friday, and about 100 students were absent Monday, said acting police chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunning </PERSON> and <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Attendance also was down at the county middle school and grade schools, officials said. Today, though, 95 percent of the school's students were in class, said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Elder </PERSON>, director of pupil personnel. Attendance is normally about 94 percent to 95 percent, he said. `` It's calmed down quite a bit,'' <PERSON> Dunning </PERSON> said. `` We've got a few called today, but not as many as yesterday -LRB- Monday -RRB-, and not near as many as Friday.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dunning </PERSON> said there was no evidence of any threat to students. `` A rumor got started at the high school, apparently by one of the students, to the effect that some people from <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were going to come to the high school sometime Friday during school hours and start killing people,'' <PERSON> Dunning </PERSON> said. `` We are continuing to look into the matter, but with no evidence, we are going on the assumption it is a rumor started by some kids that has gotten completely out of hand.'' Another rumor, <PERSON> Dunning </PERSON> said, was that a note was left with a gutted black cat that said `` they'' would be back to get blond, blue-eyed students. <PERSON> Dunning </PERSON> said the only cat found anywhere near the school was a black one found dead in a road Thursday night. `` It did n't have a note attached to it and it had been run over,'' he said. <PERSON> Dunning </PERSON> said many students called their parents Friday. `` It created a panic. At one time, they were calling students to the office five and six at a time ... telling them their parents were there to pick them up,'' he said. Those who left and stayed out Monday were not been punished, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. But he said funding was affected. In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, schools are funded largely on the basis of average daily attendance. If attendance is low, the average drops, and so does the amount of money the system receives.

<HEAD>Car Bomb Kills Three In Beirut As Christian Lawmakers Meet</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A car bomb killed three people in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Tuesday as Christian lawmakers met to choose a presidential candidate to challenge the nominee favored by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Police said 25 people were wounded in the blast at 9 a.m. in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s densely-populated <LOCATION> Dora </LOCATION> district. Among the wounded was former Information Minister <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaff </PERSON>, 50, who was heading in a motorcade through <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> for the conclave of Christian parliament members. A police spokesman said <PERSON> Skaff </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, did not attend the meeting and was admitted to a hospital in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for treatment for minor cuts and burns in the head and neck. Parliament is scheduled to meet Thursday to pick a successor to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, whose 6-year-term ends Friday. Failure to elect a new president would plunge <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> into a constitutional crisis that could trigger a new round of violence in the nation's 13-year civil war that has killed more than 130,000 people. The police spokesman said <PERSON> Skaff </PERSON>'s three bodyguards also suffered minor wounds when the bomb filled with 110 pounds of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> exploded. The spokesman, who can not be named in line with police regulations, said the other casualties were pedestrians, motorists or shopkeepers. The explosion, the 13th car bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year, destroyed 43 cars parked in the street, shattered glass and started several fires, the spokesman said. He said fire engines took an hour to put out the flames. By police count, 104 people have been killed and 378 wounded in the previous 12 car bombings. A Christian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, charged that the car bombing was `` designed to block the <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION> meeting.'' However, 27 of the 41 <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> parliament deputies took part in the four-hour meeting at <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION>, the seat of the <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. They met to try to agree on a presidential candidate after rejecting a Syrian-American agreement to name deputy <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Daher </PERSON>. A statement issued after the session said they will meet again Wednesday `` after consulting with other -LRB- non-Christian -RRB- deputies.'' The statement said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> deputies `` stress'' that <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> should convene Thursday as called for by <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> to elect a new president. But they called on <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> to shift the meeting from the old parliament building in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> in the no-man's land of the city's dividing Green Line to facilitate participation of Christian deputies. The date falls one day before <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term in office expires. Under the constitution, he can not seek a second consequtive term. A spokesman for <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> has said he expects the Christian deputies to nominate veteran Maronite politician <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>, living in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> since 1976 after surviving three assassination attempts in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, announced last week he will run for president. `` <PERSON> Edde </PERSON> is acceptable to Moslem parliament deputies. His nomination will create an atmosphere of democratic competition within <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. This is what we want to preserve,'' said <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>'s spokesman, who demanded anonymity <PERSON> Edde </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Saturday that if elected, he will first seek an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from a self-designated security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, then ask the Syrians to leave. He warned that unless he succeeds in forcing the Israelis out, he would not return to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and would ask <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to elect another president. Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist leaders have threatened to declare a separate republic in territory they control if <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> seeks to resolve the crisis by appointing a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> prime minister to head a caretaker <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. According to an unwritten national covenant dating to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, the president should be a Maronite, house speaker a Shiite, and prime minister a Sunni Moslem Christian deputies boycotted a session at Villa Mansour Aug. 18, preventing <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from mustering a quorum of 51 voters to elect a president. The only serious candidate at the time was Syrian-backed former president <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>. Christians rejected him as too closely aligned with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Moslem politicians charged that the main Christian militia was working at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s bidding to trying to undermine the elections. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, maintains 40,000 troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

There was no immediate response from the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which has waged a pro-independence insurgency since 1966 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> governs <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in violation of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions calling for its independence. It has agreed to end its 73-year rule and allow <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers to oversee the transition to independence, but only if Cuban troops withdraw from neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. U.S.-mediated talks involving <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have made progress toward a regional settlement, but there has been no agreement on a timetable for withdrawal of the more than 50,000 Cuban troops.

<TEXT>
 A psychologist who studied drug therapies for hyperactive mentally retarded children has pleaded guilty in federal court to falsifying research data in order to obtain federal funds. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON>, 36, pleaded guilty Monday to two counts of making false statements to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>. As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors will recommend that <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON> be barred from working as a research psychologist for 10 years and that he make $ 20,000 restitution to his former employer, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, which has repaid the federal institute more than $ 163,000. They also agreed to drop a charge that <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON> obstructed the institute's investigation of his data's authenticity. <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON> claimed to have done the research while working at a psychiatric clinic affiliated with the university's medical school from 1982 to 1984. But while he claimed that 99 patients participated in the studies, only 25 students received the drugs, according to <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> set sentencing for Nov. 10. The maximum possible sentence is 10 years in prison and $ 20,000 in fines. <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON> remains free on bond. According to the mental health institute, <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON> had a significant impact in the field of drug therapies for hyperactive retarded children, finding that stimulants such as Ritalin and Dexedrine helped control such children with fewer adverse side effects than the tranquilizers previously used. <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON> was employed at the Polk Center in <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, a state-run residential center for the mentally retarded when he was indicted April 9.

 The police commander in a trash-filled district of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> has offered to pay residents $ 5 for every 1,000 flies they capture. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maganto </PERSON>, who is well known for going after suspected communist assassins in the slum district of <LOCATION> Tondo </LOCATION>, said the bounty is part of his area's effort to prevent an outbreak of insect-borne diseases. `` If we can not do away with this garbage, I think it is better to eliminate these creatures that bring sickness,'' said <PERSON> Maganto </PERSON>.

Tondo is the site of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s biggest dump, called <LOCATION> Smokey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, where officials say 300 tons of refuse is dumped daily. The bounty project is being funded by several civic and business organizations.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of radical students demanding the Olympics be stopped burned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags and yelled `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>'' in scattered protests Tuesday. About 100 students taking part in a protest at <ORGANIZATION> Donguk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> burned a huge American flag outside the Shilla Hotel where the International Olympic Committee is staying. Riot police in green combat fatigues and black visored helmets watched, but did not intervene as jeering students burned the flag and shouted slogans after marching out of the main gate of the school across the road from the hotel. `` Get out <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> who support the dictatorial regime,'' the students chanted as the 10-foot-high flag doused in gasoline went up in orange flames. Protesters dispersed peacefully after the incident and did not try to approach the heavily guarded hotel. Passersby ignored the protest. During a rally at <LOCATION> Donguk </LOCATION>, the radicals demanded the Olympics be halted because they claimed the Games were being used by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to stage military maneuvers. The Games run through Oct. 2. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese forces are helping <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> protect the Olympics from any potential threat from communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 42,000 troops based in the South under a defense treaty. About 400 students later held a peaceful anti-government protest at <ORGANIZATION> Konkuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> where they burned a sign with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag painted on it and burned another large <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag. Student leaders denounced the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governments, charging they were using the Olympics to continue authoritarian rule. `` We will continue to fight to topple the fascist regime and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that support luxurious Olympics which oppress the poor,'' a student leader told the crowd at <LOCATION> Konkuk </LOCATION>. `` Oppose dictatorial Olympics,'' students chanted. Small, peaceful anti-government protests also were reported on some other <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> campuses. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to co-host the Games was rejected. South Korean officials fear the North may stage a terrorist attack to disrupt the Games. Radical students, opposed to the Olympics because <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is not participating, have staged a number of protests in recent days. The protests have been small and mostly peaceful with just a handful of hardliners taking part.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' first ambassador to the <LOCATION> Mongolian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> flew in this month, presented his credentials and hopped a train back out, heading for his office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It's a beautiful country,'' Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where he stopped en route. It also could become a useful post for tracking developments inside <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>'s huge socialist neighbors, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as they move slowly to heal their rift of more than two decades. But he has no plans to move there. When the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> established relations with <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decided the remote, frigid country was too harsh a post for permanent residence. Instead, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> will be the only <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador working out of a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> office. He will continue holding his previous post, as head of the department's <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> affairs office, and make periodic trips to <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. Two junior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats have been stationed in the capital of <ORGANIZATION> Ulan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bator </ORGANIZATION> for six months, working out of an apartment building, but they will leave for the winter, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. During his 10-day visit to <PERSON> Ulan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bator </PERSON>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he discussed with the Mongolians possibilities for finding permanent facilities for an embassy and staff. But he said the prospect of living there himself `` would take some thinking about.'' `` The winters go down to 40 to 50 below zero,'' he said. `` It's a little daunting. <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> has been closely allied to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since declaring its independence from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1921. <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> has ties with 100 countries, but only 18 maintain embassies in <LOCATION> Ulan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bator </LOCATION>, most of them East bloc nations. Many have supplies sent in from relatively luxurious <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to supplement the Mongolian diet of mutton and sour milk. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said his main concerns are to aid Americans who travel in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> and develop U.S.-Mongolian trade, which averages $ 3 million annually, mostly in cashmere and camel's hair exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But he acknowledged the new relationship `` can provide us with an interesting additional view of the state of <LOCATION> Mongolian-Soviet </LOCATION>, Mongolian-Chinese and Sino-Soviet relations.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> stations nearly 50,000 troops in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, and their presence is one of several key problems blocking normalization of Chinese-Soviet relations. The Soviets pulled an estimated 12,000 soldiers out in 1987, but have not scheduled further withdrawals. <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> took the Soviet side in the bitter Soviet-Chinese split of the early 1960s, but recently has followed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s lead and improved ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A Mongolian parliamentary delegation visited <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> this month for the first time. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considered establishing ties with <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> in the 1960s but did not want to offend the Nationalist Chinese government on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, which claims <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> as part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> broke ties with the Nationalists in 1979 and recognized the government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mongolian diplomats discussed establishing ties in the 1970s, but <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> broke off the talks unexpectedly and new efforts began only in 1986, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Security forces in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> have executed hundreds of unarmed civilians during anti-rebel operations this summer, and political prisoners are systematically tortured, a human rights group said in a report Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> report says human rights have been `` persistently violated'' during President <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Siad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>'s 19 years in power and that violations have intensified recently in countering rebel groups. `` Between several hundred and as many as 1,000 people have been summarily executed'' by government forces in northern regions since heavy fighting began in May, said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a spokesman for the international organization. The killings, sometimes during house-to-house searches for Ethiopian-backed rebels, appeared aimed at terrorizing civilian sympathizers, he said. An estimated 200 prisoners also have been executed after summary trials in the last three years, he said. The London-based organization said it had compiled evidence of `` a consistent pattern'' of torture, arbitrary arrests and unfair trials of suspected government opponents. Torture victims said they were subjected to electric shocks and sexual assault, wounded with knives, suspended upside conducted house-to-house searches and `` arbitrarily killed many people,'' it said. Foreign relief agency workers reported 21 people were dragged from their homes and shot to death in separate incidents on May 31 and June 1, it said. `` These were all deliberate extrajudicial executions of alleged political opponents as distinct from the indiscriminate heavy casualties caused by the battle in the town or subsequent bombardment by the government forces,'' the report said. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said the 600,000 people of <LOCATION> Hargeisa </LOCATION> `` by and large were fleeing and the town is now virtually empty.'' `` There seem to be deliberate attacks on civilians -LRB- in urban areas -RRB-, but the security forces are n't sufficiently organized to sweep through the countryside,'' he said. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said a British reporter accompanying government troops during anti-rebel offensives this summer estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 people have been killed in mainly aerial bombardments. The report said many prisoners held solely for the non-violent expression of their beliefs have been kept for years in deplorable conditions, often incommunicado and without proper medical aid. <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Samantar </PERSON>, a lawyer and former member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, has been in prison without charge for nearly 19 years, while <PERSON> Safia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Madar </PERSON>, an employee of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relief agency and a former science lecturer, was jailed for life in 1986 for `` membership of a subversive organization,'' the report said. Others include parliamentarians, doctors, clerics, businessmen, students and refugees, it said.

<TEXT>
 Large contingents of police were deployed in mixed Jewish-Arab areas Tuesday as Israelis started the 25-hour fast of Yom Kippur, the day of atonement and the most sacred holiday on the Jewish calendar. Traffic on the nation's highways came to a halt, commercial flights were suspended and the border with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and bridges to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> were closed. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and television and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> stopped transmitting, the only day of the year they do so. Yom Kippur came during a period of unprecedented conflict between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Over the past nine months, more than 265 Palestinians and six Israelis have been killed in what has come to be known as the intefadeh, Arabic for uprising. To prevent violence, police stepped up security in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s mixed neighborhoods and other Jewish-Arab areas of the country. The army announced that as a security precaution Palestinians from the occupied territories would be barred from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> between 2 p.m. Tuesday and 8 p.m. Wednesday. Yom Kippur ends the `` Ten Terrible Days'' during which, according to Jewish faith, <PERSON> God </PERSON> decides who will live through the coming year and who will die. During this period from the onset of the Jewish New Year until Yom Kippur, Jews bless each other with the greeting `` <PERSON> Gmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatima </PERSON> <PERSON> Tova </PERSON> _ May you be inscribed in the book of life.'' Before sundown, religious Jews shed leather shoes and belts and don white robes to prepare for the <LOCATION> Kol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nidre </LOCATION> service, the special prayer for forgiveness and life, which begins Yom Kippur. Early Tuesday, many Jews went to stores and markets to carry out the ancient rite of kapparot. Waving the chickens over their head, the penitents prayed that their sins would be transferred to the sacrificial chickens. Afterwards, the chickens were slaughtered. Stores, commercial and government offices, and public transportation shut down early to give workers time to prepare for the fast. A survey by the Hadashot daily indicated that 69 percent of Israeli Jews would fast even though the regularly observant portion of the population is estimated at only about 20 percent. In a reflective article on Yom Kippur in the left-wing daily `` Davar,'' columnist <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dankner </PERSON> wrote: `` For many free and wild souls, Yom Kippur is their last link with <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, in which not only the religious intent is important. It is more like taking part in a sporting event which measures willpower, restraint, and even spirituality.'' Tuesday also marked the 15th anniversary of the 1973 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war which began on Yom Kippur when Egyptian and Syrian armies thrust through Israeli lines in the occupied <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> and briefly threatened to invade <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> itself. On the eve of Yom Kippur, bereaved families layed wreaths and flowers at the gravesides of the 3,000 Israeli troops who died in the 1973 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Israeli newspapers printed reminiscences and commentaries about the war. <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION>'s editor, <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemer </PERSON>, recalled that Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> had offered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> a territorial settlement in 1971 and drew parallels between those days and today. `` Before the Yom Kippur war, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did not agree to withdraw from the Suez Canal. And that was not the only instance which showed that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> knows how to compromise ... only after paying the price for the stubborness which preceded it. We always come to the right conclusions too late.''

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lost ground among voters when he wore army gear and rode around in a tank a week ago, according to a new poll. A national telephone survey of 1,002 registered voters last Friday through Sunday found that 25 percent said they were less likely to vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> based on what they had seen or heard about the tank ride. Seven percent said the ride made them more likely to vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

 Four people were found shot to death execution-style today just outside this <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> community, and police said the slayings may have been drug-related. The three men and one woman were gunned down about 1:30 a.m., but other details were sketchy, said Capt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Escambia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department. He said the execution-style nature of the shootings led investigators to suspect they may be drug-related. `` That's almost always bad guy against bad guy,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. The shootings took place in a small duplex in the Pleasant Grove suburb, and all of the victims were found in one room, investigators said. At mid-day, investigators were still trying to identify the bodies, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. No arrests have been made.

 The cockpit from the <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 that lost part of its fuselage during a flight between two Hawaiian islands will be turned into a training simulator, an official of the company that bought it said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, director of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> FlightSafety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that the company, which makes flight simulators used to train pilots, was searching for a 737 cockpit when it discovered that the salvaged <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> aircraft was being sold. `` We recently launched a program to build a 737 simulator and in order to do that, we have to duplicate the cockpit of the aircraft,'' <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> said. `` That can be done a number of ways, but, if possible, we look for a salvage cockpit. We heard about this cockpit and jumped on a plane to go see.'' A section of the upper fuselage of the 19-year-old plane tore away during an inter-island hop April 28, but the pilot managed to bring the crippled plane to a safe landing on <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>. Officials said it was miraculous that only one person was killed in the accident, although 69 of the 95 passengers were injured. During the next two years, <ORGANIZATION> FlightSafety </ORGANIZATION> workers will remove every piece from the cockpit and refurbish it. Using the aluminum structure as a mold, workers will construct a fiberglass shell that will eventually be the simulator.

<TEXT>
 A report that termed homelessness a `` national disgrace'' was watered down and should have contained even stronger language and more specific recommendations, say members of the group that worked on the study for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and head of the 13-member committee that prepared the study, said the academy refused to include a strong supplemental statement. `` The report, as it now stands, basically, was rejected by a majority of the committee because they felt it was not strong enough,'' <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON> said. The edited final report `` did not allow us to express our outrage, our anger and our dismay at what we studied,'' complained <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, a panel member and the head of <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeless </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Those who served on the panel ... were a little disturbed that we were not able to go into more detail on the problems of the homeless and some of the corrective measures that should be taken,'' added <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer and panel member who joined in signing a six-page supplemental statement issued by <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Despite the complaints, <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON> raised the prospect that the material in the supplemental statement actually generated more attention by being left out of the official report than if it had been included. Faced with a choice of leaving out their strongest comments and issuing no report at all, the majority chose to permit the Academy to issue the bulk of the study and then make public their supplement independently, he explained. `` And frankly,'' he added, `` I think we wound up getting more publicity than we would have if it was buried in the report.'' The supplemental statement called for a restoration of federal support for low-income housing to 1981 levels, criticising the sharp cuts in these programs in recent years. It also urged a minimum wage at a level which would make decent housing possible in most cities and called for the federal government to be the guarantor of last resort in health care. `` The way you do away with homelessness is to provide homes,'' commented Stark, a former undersecretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The panelists were `` concerned that not enough emphasis was put on the plight of homelessness, in terms of just a statistical study,'' <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said. `` I think the Academy is right in one sense,'' he added. `` They want all their reports to be as scientific and objective as possible.'' But, he said, once he had visited shelters and met the homeless and people who work with them, he realized that more was needed in this report. The group `` felt that the tone was important, as well as the substance, and this was not an issue where one can be comfortable being as bland as such reports tend to be,'' said <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON>, former science adviser to President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and head of the independent <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> since 1981, was quoted in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying the supplementary statement had been rejected because it was `` polemical and emotional.'' Press' office said he was not available Tuesday and referred calls to the Academy's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the study as requested by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. At that <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> termed the official report `` strong,'' but said some of the specific recommendations were `` not sufficiently scholarly and documented to be included.'' The panel members `` were appalled at what they saw'' in their research, <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. He said academy reviewers agreed with many of the panel's opinions, but felt they needed more detailed economic analyses before they could be published officially `` The committee members endorsed the -LRB- official -RRB- report, and were at liberty to release their own statement elsewhere, which they have just done,'' he added. The official 242-page report portrays a homeless population not only of alcoholics and former mental patients, but one with growing numbers of children and families scraping out a dismal existence in rural communities. It calls children under 18 the fastest growing group among the nation's homeless and says this is `` nothing short of a national disgrace that must be treated with the urgency that such a situation demands.''

<BYLINE>Endangered Squirrel On National Forest Land Targeted For Ski Resort
^By PAIGE St. JOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An endangered species of flying squirrels and a virgin stand of red spruce are in the way of a developer's plan to turn a section of national forest into a $ 100 million ski resort. Environmentalists are mounting forces to oppose a proposal by <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to build a resort community on the north slope of <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spruce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, which overlooks the <ORGANIZATION> Cranberry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The developer is negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to swap another piece of forestland for the Big Spruce land. `` We're concerned about the precedent here, of swapping really pristine land at the call of an out-of-state developer,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wimmer </PERSON>, conservation chairwoman for the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> officials joined with Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> last week to announce the development, which has sold 100 club memberships already, starting at $ 15,000 each. The governor claimed <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> could create as many as 2,300 jobs in four years, counting spin-off services. Building lots will cost between $ 100,000 and $ 500,000, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. But <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> does not yet own the heart of its project _ the top of the mountain, which has an elevation of 4,695 feet. Without it, officials said Monday, the resort would have no long ski runs. Joined with 1,000 to 2,000 acres of land <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> already owns, the company would create a 2,300-acre complex with two golf courses, 32 ski runs, seven restaurants, lodges, cabins and houses. The mountaintop is a scarce habitat for the Northern Virginia flying squirrel, which lives in only a few areas of the state. The rust-colored, palm-sized animals roam the woods at night, gliding among the tree tops. The flying squirrels have disappeared over most of their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> range for unknown reasons, but environmentalists blame the decline on a loss of habitat. The squirrels like mature red spruce stands, which are experiencing problems in the region. `` The spruce decline along the whole Appalachian corridor is very serious. It is becoming very scarce,'' <PERSON> Wimmer </PERSON> said. `` These areas need to be set aside.'' She said she also is waiting for the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to check the mountain for other endangered species, including the Cheat Mountain salamander, which lives in red spruce forests. Local trout fishermen also are concerned the resort would pollute Day Run, a trout stream, and in turn hurt the <LOCATION> Williams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cranberry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which flows through nationally-protected wilderness areas. And conservationalists have another problem _ the way the matter has been handled. While the development was announced publicly last week, it was revealed that the corporation began talking privately with the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> a year ago a land swap. `` We feel there's been way too much work done without local input on this,'' <PERSON> Wimmer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trochlil </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <ORGANIZATION> Elkins </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> had made no firm trade offers. To be acceptable, the land must match Big Spruce's stands of red spruce, he said. He said there was no available figure on how much of the mountain would be cut for ski slopes. He said the mountain is not a wilderness area, and that three to four Forest Service-supervised logging operations already are cutting trees in the national forest. <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> officials did not return repeated telephone messages left this week.

<HEAD>Mother, Daughter Plead Innocent To Hiring Hit Man To Kill Husbands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman and her daughter pleaded innocent to charges they tried to hire a hit man to kill their ex-husbands in alleged schemes that prosecutors say each woman undertook without the other's knowledge. Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasimatas </PERSON> set bail at $ 50,000 for <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> <PERSON> East </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, and at $ 30,000 for her daughter, <PERSON> Venise </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>. `` They apparently were not working together in the solicitation for murder,'' Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichler </PERSON> said. Police say criminal-intelligence unit investigators heard that each woman was looking for a hit man, so an undercover officer telephoned each separately. East allegedly offered the officer $ 10,000 to kill her husband, saying she would pay for it from his insurance policy, worth about $ 100,000, <PERSON> Eichler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> gave the officer a $ 1,000 personal check as a down payment on a $ 5,000 fee to kill her ex-husband, he said. `` Miss <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' ex-husband was accused of molesting her young daughter, which was the alleged motive in that case. It's very clear ... that both defendants together fabricated evidence in that -LRB- alleged molestation -RRB- case,'' <PERSON> Eichler </PERSON> said. The solicitation charge carries a maximum prison term of six years, while a conspiracy charge could mean life in prison. <PERSON> Kasimatis </PERSON> scheduled a preliminary hearing Oct. 3.

<TEXT>
 Four police officers were fired after supervisors overheard them broadcasting vulgar conversations over citizens band radios while on duty, police say. Using portable CBs they plugged into their cruisers, the officers used derogatory sexual language to describe a female sergeant, used racial slurs and talked about hiding their cars rather than patrolling, police said. `` After you get past some of the offensiveness and the disgust, their behavior shows there is a total immaturity of these officers,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerwens </PERSON> said Monday. `` These are the people we entrust with the safety of the community.'' The Fraternal Order of Police will appeal the dismissals, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> DeRusso </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> chapter. He said the officers' conversations were private, and defended the content, saying they were venting job frustrations.

 Three members of a polygamist clan were arraigned today on second-degree murder charges in the slaying of a state corrections officer during a police confrontation with the family. It was the first appearance in state court of the three defendants, who with the clan's matriarch were convicted in May of 20 of 23 federal counts stemming from the Jan. 16 bombing of a Mormon chapel and subsequent standoff. Monday night, police arrested a man in a suspected arson attempt at the same chapel, in <LOCATION> Kamas </LOCATION>. Summit County Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said an alarm inside the church went off, alerting sheriff's officers to a break-in. Asked if the case was a possible attempted arson, he said, `` There is some evidence there that would indicate that.'' <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> and Sheriff <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eley </PERSON> declined to identify the arrested man or provide other details. Clan leader <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, his brother <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> appeared before 3rd Circuit Judge <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> today, who set a tentative preliminary hearing date of Sept. 27. <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> was shot to death when a gun battle ended the 13-day siege Jan. 28. The manacled defendants, brought from the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> where they have been held without bail since their arrests in January, were asked if they would agree to a prosecution motion that their preliminary hearing be held in a <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> courtroom. Attorneys for <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> and Singer agreed, while the attorney for <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> said he would discuss the matter with his client. The three defendants and matriarch <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> all received minimum federal sentences earlier this month from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, who said his hands were tied by federal statutes requiring minimum mandatory terms for the use of bombs or firearms in crimes. <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27, received the stiffest sentence, 15 years in prison, while Mrs. Singer, 45, was given five years. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, 22, both were sentenced to 10 years. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, whom prosecutors have named as the triggerman in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s death, said during his federal sentencing that he was trying to defend the Swapp brothers when he fired the shot believed to have killed the lawman.

 Building on decades of good ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is seeking a greater business and diplomatic role in the country now that a cease-fire has been declared in the Iran-Iraq war. West German optimism toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ which sends its students to be educated in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and buys more goods from this country than any other _ grew after the recent release of West German hostage <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> from his pro-Iranian Lebanese kidnappers on Sept. 12. Germans have long felt what one expert calls a `` post-Romantic interest'' in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A sector of the West German popular press provides constant coverage of the doings of <PERSON> Soraya </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakhtiary </PERSON>, once married to the shah of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 An improving trade deficit helped economic growth remain strong in the second quarter despite the Farm Belt drought, but inflation was more severe than previously believed, the government said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the broadest measure of the nation's $ 4 trillion economy, grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.0 percent in the April-June period. That was slower than the 3.4 percent expansion rate in the first quarter, but still brisk. If not for the drought, second-quarter growth would have been a more robust 3.9 percent. Crop and livestock losses for the year are estimated at $ 13.9 billion and will be even more of a drag on the economy in the third and fourth quarters. The government said accelerating inflation accompanied the strong growth. One price measure tied to the GNP rose at the fastest pace in nearly six years and was more than triple the first-quarter rate. `` However you measure inflation, we got more of it than we thought in the second quarter and that's bad news for the financial markets,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Reacting to the report, the bond market opened weak in light trading. The GNP deflator, which reflects changes in buying patterns as well as prices, rose at an annual rate of 5.5 percent in the second quarter, compared with 1.7 percent in the first quarter. It was the biggest jump since the third quarter of 1982. The second-quarter deflator had been estimated a month earlier at a somewhat more moderate 5.1 percent. Also, the previous report had showed stronger second-quarter growth, 3.3 percent instead of 3.0 percent. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called Tuesday's report good news `` The facts, plus the moderating growth rate, point to inflation remaining under control,'' he said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the acceleration in inflation after nearly six years of economic growth is, while troublesome, more moderate than in previous expansions. `` All in all we're going to sail into the election in pretty good shape,'' he said. `` The general thrust of the economy, I would think, favors the Republicans. Growth is strong, but not too strong. There's some inflation, but not as much as there could be.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, concerned with signs of overheating in the economy, began an inflation-fighting program in late March by pushing up short-term interest rates. Its goal is to curb demand and slow economic growth to a level that can be maintained without significant inflation. Analysts differ over whether the economy in the quarter ending this month is responding. Some, pointing to an upturn in unemployment and a slight drop in retail sales last month, say growth is moderating. Others see the August figures as more of a pause than a trend. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a private forecasting firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said higher interest rates are helping to curb spending by consumers who have adjustable rate mortgages and other fluctuating loans. Meanwhile, he said, growth in exports is slowing from unsustainably high levels and by next year will be hurt by the partial recovery in the value of the dollar this year. `` I think we can pretty much say the export boom is coming to an end,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said investment spending and exports will remain strong, while consumer spending will remain about the same. `` Any actual moderation is still in the future,'' he said. The government attributed its downward revision in the second-quarter growth to slightly less expansion than first believed in exports and business investment. Exports of goods and services expanded at a 9.1 percent annual rate, compared with the previous estimate of 11.6 percent. Business investment spending shot up 15.0 percent, compared with last month's estimate of 16.3 percent. However, consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds of all economic activity, was up 3.0 percent at an annual rate, compared with the slightly weaker 2.7 percent previously announced. The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation, at an annual level of $ 3.99 trillion in the second quarter, $ 29.1 billion higher than the January-March period. In another report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that after-tax profits by corporations surged 8.9 percent in the second quarter to an annual rate of $ 162.7 billion, up from a 2.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter. It was the most profitable quarter since the July-September period of 1983.

 A church will no longer allow a group of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> to use its property for a powwow because the pastor says the event unleashes `` spiritual forces that are anti-Christ.'' In a letter to the powwow organizers, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Evangel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION>, wrote, `` We believe that there is a polarity of spiritual belief between us that is irreconcilable.'' The group had held the powwow at the church for the last two years. The letter said the church believes it `` permitted some spiritual forces that are anti-Christ and anti-Yahweh to operate on our facility during the days of the powwow.'' The letter was not more specific. A secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Evangel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the pastor would not comment further. The church's decision had `` nothing to do with you as a nation or race of people or a reflection of your personal or corporate conduct or courtesy,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. Powwow organizers said they were puzzled and saddened. `` It's a complete misunderstanding of our culture,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Roaix </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Naugatuck </LOCATION>, editor of The Eagle, an Indian-affairs newspaper published by <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Eagle Wing is a co-sponsor of the powwow. More than 95 percent of American Indians are Christians, <PERSON> Roaix </PERSON> said. `` I find it sad that in the 20th century there are religious groups still operating on an 18th-century type of attitude,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> for Development of <LOCATION> Meriden </LOCATION>, the other sponsor. `` Powwows are basically social events,'' <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, editorial writer at The Eagle, said Tuesday the powwow also educated people about the Indian culture. `` It's like going to a fair,'' she said. The festival, to be held this weekend, has been moved to <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. It will include American Indian arts and crafts, singers and dancers, a replica of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> bark-covered wigwam, storytelling and cooking demonstrations. Last year's event drew more than 3,000 visitors, with the church receiving a share of the proceeds, <PERSON> Roaix </PERSON> said.

 A landlord convicted of multiple housing violations strapped on an electronic ankle bracelet and began a sentence of house arrest in an apartment without hot water, refrigerator, stove or air conditioning. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> began serving the 30-day sentence Monday, forced to stay in the apartment from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. Monday through Saturday and all day Sunday. His ankle bracelet triggers a police alarm if he attempts to leave at the wrong times. `` As far as I'm concerned, if he has a toilet, he's lucky,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who sentenced <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> after he pleaded guilty in August to at least 40 housing code violations. `` I visited apartments there where some people had holes in the floor for a bathroom.'' The charges against <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> included claims that raw sewage spilled out on tenants' floors and that apartments were infested with rats and roaches. The judge also ordered him to pay a $ 5,000 fine and placed him on probation for one year. <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> no longer owns the property that he is staying in for the month. The new owners agreed to rent him an apartment. <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>, 36, said he was being made a scapegoat and that the apartment he was sentenced to was in worse condition than when he rented it out. `` I'm so mad,'' he said. `` I need a punching bag to take out my frustrations.''

<TEXT>
 Carcasses of 73 wild horses have been discovered in an isolated section of central <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and authorities believe they were gunned down, a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Tuesday. Federal investigators were tipped by a person who was questioned about an earlier rifle slaughter of 44 horses. The two sites are 30 miles apart. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, bureau spokesman, said a helicopter crew Monday identified 73 piles of bones and other evidence. The spokesman said ground crews were headed into the remote area to verify the cause of death of the horses but the evidence so far `` leads us to believe they were shot.'' He said the carcasses and bones of the horses were strewn along an area one to two miles wide and about eight miles long, apparently gunned down over a six-month period starting about one year ago. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said the person who led investigators to the grisly discovery is n't being identified. He also declined to comment on whether there are any firm leads in either of the horse slaughters. He said local authorities, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> have been notified about the latest case, and land management employees have been told to `` increase their looking and try to spot any similar tragedies.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said the carcasses were n't spotted immediately because crews who fly the area making horse counts `` fly at higher elevations and watch for dust clouds and movement.'' He said the maximum penalty for shooting a wild horse is a fine of $ 2,000 and a year in prison for each killing. More than 38,000 wild horses now run the open range of 10 western states, up from about 17,000 when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 made it a crime to harrass or kill wild horses on public lands. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> has up to 28,000 wild horses, according to estimates. At the turn of the century there were some 2 million wild horses in the West, but they were relentlessly hunted by cowboys and `` mustangers'' in trucks and airplanes. The animals were slaughtered for pet food and glue.

 Dozens of people were snookered by a bogus classified ad and showed up at a pier Tuesday for a non-existent automobile auction of 600 cars, `` Audis to Mercedes,'' for $ 50 to $ 700. `` The situation is frought with humor and everybody was joking about it,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, the agency responsible for disposing of towed and confiscated vehicles that are not claimed. By noon, nearly 70 people had arrived at the pier, `` including a couple from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, clutching about $ 5,000 in their fists,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. `` They figured they could pick up five Audis at a $ 1,000 each, sell them at $ 2,000 and double their money. I do n't know how they planned to drive five cars back.'' The ad, which appeared in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> classified section Monday, said a `` once-a-year liquidation'' auction would be held Tuesday at Pier 76 in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> by the `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Parking Authority.'' There is no such authority. And while Pier 76 is where impounded and confiscated cars are stored, auctions are held every Friday at Pier 24. There is no annual clearance sale. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said about 400 cars are auctioned by the city each month, either cars that have been towed away because the motorist disobeyed parking regulations, or cars confiscated from scofflaws. The ad was placed by someone claiming to be <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, who ordered the $ 403.90 bill sent to the department. `` With the millions of ads that we run, this occasionally happens,'' said Times spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>. `` We'll do everything we can to straighten this out with the city.''

 A prosecutor whose boss complained her short skirts made her look like a man-hunting `` bimbo'' has been fired after lodging a complaint against him with the county human rights commission. <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assistant state attorney, had refused to trade her designer blouses and tight-fitting skirts for more conservative atire despite memos from her supervisor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Countryman </PERSON>. `` I'm a little embarrassed for the state attorney's office,'' Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowenthal </PERSON>, said after Monday's firing `` I think they've stepped into a hole and now they're digging it deeper. Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> on Monday received a dismissal letter charging she had mishandled drunken-driving cases, was frequently absent or tardy from court, and failed to complete paperwork. `` This is garbage,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 25. `` It just shows to what lengths they will go to get someone. I've never been a crusader before, but it was my neck on the line and I had to do something.'' Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said her firing came in direct response to the complaint she filed against Countryman last month, charging him with discriminating against her. No hearing date was set. Countryman's problems with Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> were spelled out in five memos and in Monday's termination letter. `` I told her that ts the Republican to soften his stance once the election is over. `` I would hope after Nov. 8 he would take a closer look,'' <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said. `` Certainly -LRB- former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> -RRB- </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, one of his principal economic advisers, knows we have to so something about the deficit.'' <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative who has gained a reputation as a skilled negotiator, called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> the toughest job he has ever faced.

Critics have charged that it is wrong to use current surpluses in Social Security to lower the overall budget deficit since that means the money will not be earmarked specifically for retirement benefits when Baby Boomers begin retiring in the early part of the next century. <PERSON> Stauss </PERSON> said the panel is examining boosting taxes on cigarettes and alcohol and other consumption taxes as preferable to raising individual income tax rates. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said the panel probably will make some recommendations on reforming the budget process, examining such issues as whether a two-year budget would improve <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' ability to meet deadlines and whether a line-item veto or a constitutional amendment to balance the budget should be adopted.

<HEAD>Council Bans Videotape After Black Leaders' Complaints</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> banned use of a police videotape on drug-trafficking gangs after black leaders complained a profile of gang members promoted racist stereotypes. The council on Monday also agreed to establish a task force to plan with police strategies for keeping gangs out of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, and unanimously approved a resolution condemning a recent series of racially motivated assaults and vandalism. Police Chief <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangan </PERSON>, who had been ordered by City Manager <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> to stay away from the meeting to avoid confrontations, defended the videotape. `` We support the task force's efforts, and hope it will be successful,'' <PERSON> Mangan </PERSON> said. `` I just hope this delay, this possible change of direction, does not work to the advantage of drug gangs. That would be a real tragedy.'' A group of black leaders said the videotape, which depicts gang activity in other cities, unfairly blames black youths for the drug problem and has caused a backlash by police and racist groups. The tape had been shown to school and civic groups and on a city cable television station. `` It is one of the most racist pieces of propaganda I have ever seen,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Spokane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> employee. `` If there had been proper input and consultation, this tape would have never gone out.'' `` The bad guys come in all colors and wear all kinds of hats,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Boston </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Spokane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. Police have repeatedly stopped black youths for minor offenses, sometimes with guns drawn, the black leaders complained. `` We think it's undue harassment,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinlow </PERSON>. `` The police department is there to protect us, but we do feel they are overreacting.'' <PERSON> Mangan </PERSON> said the videotape was prepared mostly from network documentaries and `` based on the best advice we were able to obtain from a number of cities which have gone through what we are just starting to go through.'' The task force will be comprised of five black people chosen by Mayor <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON>, two members of the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Human Relations, and council members <PERSON> Sheri </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Tuesday characterized as `` totally insulting'' speculation that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selected her husband as his running mate because <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s good looks might attract female voters `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would n't have selected someone who could not stand in his stead for president,'' she told reporters during her first solo campaign tour. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said her husband has established a reputation as an expert on defense and arms control issues as a 12-year <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> veteran, and has met with many foreign leaders. `` The women of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> have elected him, and it's certainly not because of his looks,'' she said. During a series of brief interviews with local television reporters, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> blamed the media for the controversy surrounding the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate's academic performance and military service. `` He's never been a person who kowtowed to the media, stroked them, had them in our home,'' she said. `` The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> media elite did n't know him and they were struck off guard.'' In an earlier interview with <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the media is overwhelmingly liberal and was pursuing her husband because he is conservative. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who met her husband in 1972 when both were attending night classes at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, is considered one of the stronger assets of her husband's campaign and his most trusted adviser. A senior campaign official said that in recognition of her campaign skills, she has been asked to travel independently on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket. She will join the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator for one or two days each week. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 39, is a practiced campaigner who often pulls her husband away from reporters when he begins to respond to impromptu questions and tends to make misstatements or garble his words. She insists she is `` not trying to protect him'' but is reminding him to cut his conversation short and keep up with his campaign schedule. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, told one news conferent that his wife `` is my best adviser, my strongest supporter, the person that I love more than anybody else in this world.'' He called her `` a very strong, independent-minded woman'' with whom he has a very close relationship.

Dukakis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Never one to mince words, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been particularly outspoken at times when questioned about her Jewish faith or world events affecting the Jewish state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. She was quick to express her outrage when <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> embraced Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who was accused of complicity in Nazi war crimes. On the other hand, she has n't been afraid to criticize <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> efforts to force Soviet Jews to emigrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> instead of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Most recently, she spoke forcefully when asked about the resignations of a handful of volunteers and a ranking <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adviser who were mentioned in allegations of anti-Jewish activities. One volunteer who resigned had praised a researcher who has denied the existence of the Holocaust during World War II. `` For anyone to suggest the Holocaust was a hoax is very painful,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Six million Jews and millions of others lost their lives. ... One has to wonder why these people were attracted and recruited to the campaign of my husband's opponent. The prospect of being the nation's first Jewish first lady is not lost on <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the wife of Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. She returned to <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> on Tuesday afternoon from a trip to <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> so she could spend the holiest of Jewish holidays, Yom Kippur, at home. She was attending Temple <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> Tuesday night before returning home for the traditional fast. She has been an active and aggressive campaigner for her husband and referred to her faith frequently during appearances before the primary in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where Jews are an important voting bloc. She traces her vigorous lobbying on behalf of refugees from around the world to the lessons of the Holocaust. `` I feel a great deal of pride in my ethnic and religious background,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, leaning back in her chair and breaking into a broad smile, said in a recent interview at her home. She said at the outset of the campaign she feared she would encounter anti-Semitism but has said since that that has n't happened But both she and her Greek Orthodox husband have been criticized by conservatives for their interfaith marriage. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jatras </PERSON>, an aide to Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., circulated a letter in May denouncing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his marriage to a `` non-Christian'' and said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was therefore not a Christian in good standing Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also was targeted by a conservative columnist who questioned her commitment to Judaism by citing her marriage to a non-Jew. The Dukakises have said little about either incident, choosing to ignore instead of publicize them. Their children, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, born during Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' first marriage, and daughters <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kara </PERSON>, observe the holidays of both the Jewish and Greek Orthodox faiths with their parents. But in other public statements, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said she is `` fiercely proud'' of her faith and also has promised to host a Passover Seder in the White House if her husband is elected president. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the daughter of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, associate conductor of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, and the late <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, who met her future husband when both were studying music and the arts in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> prior to World War II. They left <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was coming to power. While she was raised in a Jewish home in a predominantly Jewish community, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said she did not come to fully appreciate her heritage until a 1976 visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Holocaust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vashem </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` That visit changed everthing for me,'' she recently told <PERSON> Haolam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazeh </PERSON>, a Jewish weekly newspaper. `` I was brought up on this memory but I do n't think I understood the full significance until I visited Yad Vashem.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was a member of a presidential commission on the Holocaust until 1986, when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declined to appoint her to a new term.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has planted operatives in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> who seek to stir up public protests in an effort to provoke the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government into overreacting, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said today. `` We have received clear testimony from <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> people that they have deliberately done things to provoke an overreaction on the part of the government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters in answer to a question. In a subsequent interview, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said agency personnel, under questioning from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said they had `` sought to generate vigorous demonstrations. ... Agents of our government have assisted in organizing the kinds of anti-government demonstrations that have been calculated to stimulate and provoke arrests.'' <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Basso </PERSON> declined to confirm or deny <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s information. `` We do brief <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but would n't discuss that publicly,'' she said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he did not know whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> provocations were behind a July 10 demonstration at <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, that resulted in some 40 arrests. The anti-Sandininsta Contra rebels are asking for release of those prisoners as a gesture of good faith before resuming high-level peace talks with the government. But he said it is `` unmistakable'' that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> has been behind some of the public unrest that has led to government crackdowns on the opposition and worsened the atmosphere for faltering peace discussions between the two sides. `` It has been foolish of the Sandinistas to respond to those provocations,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, referring to the shutting down of opposition media outlets like the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>, a church-run radio station. `` I've made that unmistakably clear to people in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. They have to demonstrate their commitment to the democratization they have announced'' in earlier peace agreements, he said. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference. `` I do not believe it is the proper role of our government to try to provoke riots ... or deliberately to try to antagonize governing officials into foolish overreactions,'' he said. `` We should be using the influence of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to encourage the peace process, not discourage it.'' The two sides broke off talks on Monday in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after failing to agree on a new site for resuming peace negotiations, and Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused the rebels of seeking to avoid negotiations in hopes of receiving new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid.

 A judge handed down maximum sentences Tuesday to two arsonists for firebombing the house of a Guyanese immigrant who had taken a stand against drug dealers invading his neighborhood. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demakos </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, 17, to 50 years to life in prison for two first-degree arson convictions. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 28, received the maximum of 25 years to life on a single arson count. Sentences for criminal mischief and intimidating a witness were ordered to run concurrently with the arson terms, so the men will serve no extra time for those crimes. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> were convicted last month of throwing Molotov cocktails into a house in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. The house was owned by a man who went by the single name of <PERSON> Arjune </PERSON>, a recent immigrant who had complained to police about drug dealing near his home. The case achieved national notoriety when a police officer assigned to guard <PERSON> Arjune </PERSON>'s house after the firebombing was shot to death as he sat in his patrol car. Police said the shooting of Officer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was ordered by high-level drug dealers who controlled the neighborhood's crack trade. The case led to a major police offensive against drug dealers in the area. Arjune, has since been given a new home and identity under the federal witness protection program, testified at the trial that his house was firebombed twice early in the morning of Nov. 10, 1987. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was arrested after the first of two attacks, which were a couple of hours apart, but <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> participated in both, <PERSON> Arjune </PERSON> said.

 The Citadel has reached an out-of-court settlement with its head chaplain, who had sued the state-supported military school accusing it of interfering with worship services, the school's lawyer said Tuesday. Details of the settlement with the Rev. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garthe </PERSON> will be spelled out in a federal order in the next week or so, said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawes </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Citadel </ORGANIZATION> lawyer. He said the settlement reached Monday `` redefines and clarifies the job description for the position of chaplain'' but does not include payment of damages. <PERSON> Garthe </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> minister and retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> chaplain, has been director of chaplain activities at The Citadel since 1983. He claimed in his suit that the school violated the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion and the prohibition of a state religion. The school denied the charges, but said it had been `` critical of -LRB- Garthe's -RRB- lack of support and general acceptance by the Corps of Cadets.'' <PERSON> Garthe </PERSON> claimed that church attendance had nosedived after 1973 court ruling that it could not be mandatory, but that it had actually increased after he was hired 10 years later. Efforts to reach Garthe for comment on the settlement were unsuccessful. A person answering the telephone in his office said he would not be in Tuesday. In his suit, <PERSON> Garthe </PERSON> also claimed he was threatened with firing after he complained that offerings collected at Protestant worship services on Sundays went to the state's general fund. The chaplain accused the military college of controlling such things as the choice of speakers at services, uniform requirements, seating, flag display, the bearing of arms in the chancel and selection of music.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned in a flag factory Tuesday and declared, `` My friends, flag sales are doing well and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is doing well.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has sought to turn the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag into an election issue, toured the <ORGANIZATION> Annin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and then spoke at a rally outside, talking about patriotism as well as stressing what he said were economic accomplishments of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The Republican presidential nominee reiterated his contention that Democratic opponent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had `` raised taxes several times as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and I believe he will raise them again if you elect him president.'' `` Americans have a new economic power, and I'm not going to let them take that away from you,'' he said, with a huge <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag as a backdrop. `` The flags you make fly over an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that today is stronger and more prosperous than at any time in its proud history,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a group of several hundred people, many of them employees of the plant. Inside, he chatted with workers at sewing machines, and at one point he pushed a foot pedal attached to a machine that cut cloth. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has cited the small factory in speeches around the country, noting that its sales had been up since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and he took office in 1981. He joked that he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose rallies also prominently feature <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags, were `` responsible for only half'' of the purchases of 37,000 flags the plant manufactures each week. The company is the nation's largest flag maker. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to swear in <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, a fellow Texan, as the Secretary of Education. Hispanic leaders have questioned the timing of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to nominate <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> in the waning months of his administration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said he would appoint <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> to his cabinet, and critics suggest <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> speeded the process to help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other states with high Hispanic populations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is spending most of his time this week preparing for Sunday's nationally televised debate with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is reviewing issues and possible questions with top aides and policy advisers and later in the week will engage in mock debates with former Deputy Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, aides have said. Asked by reporters how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s debate preparation was going, campaign political director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said: `` Diligent.'' `` You want to avoid costly mistakes. And you want to come across as presidential,'' <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said. In his flag speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s amplified voice easily drowned out the shouts of a few dozen protesters, two of whom were carrying signs that said: `` Patriotism is the Last Refuge of a Scroundrel _ <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>.'' Also, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, passed out copies of a statement accusing the administration of a `` do-nothing trade policy'' that resulted in layoffs of `` thousands of our sisters and brothers in industry.'' <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> told reporters that textile workers are among the poorest paid of all workers and that the average wage of those in the <LOCATION> Annin </LOCATION> flag plant was between $ 4 and $ 5 an hour. Company president <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>, who introduced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said that never `` has flag demand been as strong as in these past five to six years. I do n't know why it happened, but it happened during the Reagan-Bush watch.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of accentuating only negative economic statistics. `` I would hate to try to win the presidency by being so negative,'' he said. On this day, he spared <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from some of the attacks that he himself has made in recent campaign appearances. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made much of the Pledge of Allegiance issue in his campaign, attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> legislation to require public school teachers to lead their classes in saying the pledge. However, he did not raise that issue in Tuesday's speech <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, the political director, said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is one of nine states the campaign views as crucial battlegrounds in the fall election. The others are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said. `` None of them are out of reach for either candidate.

Several women in the diner told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> he looked better in person than on television.

<HEAD>Group Says Treaty Should Cover Solvents</HEAD>

 International agreements to preserve the earth's protective ozone layer should cover two industrial solvents outside the current treaty, an environmental group said Tuesday. The solvents, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride, can also liberate chlorine that destroys ozone high in the stratosphere, just as the better-known chlorofluorocarbon or <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds do, said the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in a study of the ozone problem. <PERSON> Arjun </PERSON> <PERSON> Makhijani </PERSON>, an engineer and consultant who was principal author of the study, said methyl chloroform, the most common industrial solvent, probably accounts for one-quarter of current ozone destruction. The <ORGANIZATION> Halogenated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solvents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, principal trade association of manufacturers and major users of solvents containing chlorine, said it believed the institute had relied on outdated science and had overstated the potency of the two solvents. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidel </PERSON>, an ozone expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said very little carbon tetrachloride is escaping to the atmosphere and methyl chloroform is a `` definitely second tier'' source of ozone destruction. About 124,000 tons of methyl chloroform are used worldwide each year, the institute said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use, for such tasks as degreasing metal in the auto industry, is about 35 percent of that total. Some 227,000 tons of carbon tetrachloride are used each year, 80 percent of it as a raw material for production of chlorofluorocarbon compounds. Analysts including <PERSON> Makijani </PERSON> agree that production will decline as <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production drops under the 1987 treaty calling for 50 percent cuts by 1998. Methyl chloroform stays in the atmosphere only nine or 10 years on average before breaking down, said <PERSON> Makhijani </PERSON>. So short a lifetime means `` 80 percent of methyl chloroform never gets to the stratosphere. But because there's so much of it, the 30 percent that reaches the stratosphere is more destructive than CFC-113,'' one of the solvents regulated by the treaty, he said. Because the lifetime is so short, reductions in emissions would mean an early decline in atmospheric chlorine, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds can last more than a century, and the atmospheric backlog plus all that has accumulated in earth-bound products such as refrigerators means the effects of production cuts will be a long time showing an effect. `` We have a few problems with the numbers they used this morning,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortina </PERSON>, spokesman for the industry group. `` Five to 10 percent is probably a more accurate'' estimate of ozone destruction from methyl chloroform. Controls are not needed on either solvent, but if they are `` they should be based on international agreement,'' said fellow spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Risotto </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seidel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the agency estimated that methyl chloroform was only about 10 percent as destructive of ozone as the most powerful CFC compound.

 Police stepped up patrols near the home of Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> on Tuesday after the black congressman expressed concern for his family in the wake of vandalism at his home that included racial slurs. `` I'm the congressman, not my wife, my brother or my children,'' <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> said as he cleaned paint poured on an entrance-way floor at his home in suburban Madison. `` I can defend myself but I want them to leave my family out of it.'' <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> said his wife returned to home late Monday to find a racial slur on doors in the entrance-way. He said the words, at the top of each door, appeared to have been scratched into the wood by `` a pencil or a pen without ink. They had started the words ` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Con' on one door but it appeared the point of what they were using had broken. Madison Police Chief <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON> said he sent officers to the house. `` And, of course, we are going to have extra patrols in that area _ that goes without saying,'' <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON> said. `` Sure it makes you angry,'' <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> said. `` We've come a long way in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> but cases like this remind you how far we've got to go.'' <PERSON> Espy </PERSON>, a Democrat and the state's first black congressman since Reconstruction, is being challenged in the November election by white Republican <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> has been leading polls in the district. His brother has been his campaign manager. <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> said he would immediately return to the campaign but was concerned for his family. `` My son is 5 and my daughter is 8 and I had to explain to them the history of race relations in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' he said. Referring to the scratched epithet, he said, `` I had to tell my children what that meant and why somebody would do that. It was not an easy thing to do.'' <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> said plants in the entry-way had been uprooted and paint dashed on some of the plants. `` Something like this should not be a part of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political process,'' said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, contacted by telephone as he headed to <LOCATION> Belzoni </LOCATION> for a day of campaigning. `` We should talk about the issues and beat each other on top of the head with those.'' `` I ca n't imagine any of my people doing that,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. `` Who knows why someone would do something like this. It may not have had anything to do with politics but no matter why it was done, it was totally wrong and I regret to see it.'' <PERSON> Espy </PERSON>, 34, said he had received threatening calls in the past, `` but you always expect those. There has not been an increase in those calls and this is the first time something like this has happened.'' `` I think most Mississippians would be upset to hear something like this has happened but we all realize there are still some ignorant people running around,'' he said.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years have been great for the flag business, says a member of the family that owns the nation's largest flag-making company `` The flag market usually has ups and downs, but it's been a steady incline since the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration came aboard,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>, vice presidant of <ORGANIZATION> Annin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The fourth-generation co-owner and his brother, <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, opened one of their New Jursey factories Tuesday to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has mentioned the company often in contending that the administration has revived patriotic fervor. `` My friends, flag sales are doing well and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is doing well,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in front of a crowd of about 250, many of them <ORGANIZATION> Annin </ORGANIZATION> employees, in a flag-waving rally across the street from the old brick factory. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>, whose brother joined <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the rostrum, said the company has enjoyed a sales increase of roughly 25 percent in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. <ORGANIZATION> Annin </ORGANIZATION> is one of a handful of major companies making the stars and stripes. <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said he could not provide exact sales figures. He credited <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the steady growth of his company, which has expanded from three to five plants during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term. `` I think his patriotism has stirred flag sales,'' <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said. `` He's increased pride in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' While <LOCATION> Annin </LOCATION> has supplied flags for inaugurations, the Apollo 11 moon flight, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the armed forces, everyday citizens still account for the bulk of sales, <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said. He said the Bloomfield factory each week makes about 30,000 of the small flags that have lately become common fare at patriotic celebrations. In addition, about 7,000 to 10,000 of the 3-by-5-foot flags commonly displayed by homeowners are produced each week at the factory, where women operate machines by hand, starting at minimum wage. In another flag-interest indicator, the federal government last year satisfied more than 109,000 requests to briefly fly flags over the nation's Capitol and then ship them to people. The requests numbered just 43,011 in 1979, a clerk said. While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> deserves credit for the sales trend, <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said this year's unusually strong September might also have something to do with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign. Labor Day usually marks a fast drop in flag buying, but demand has held steady in 1988, <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said. The company found out about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit about a week ago, and quickly arranged five buses to haul in employees from its three other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> locations, <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Annin </ORGANIZATION> also has a plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Despite the good business of recent years, <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said he's spotted a less-welcome trend: an influx of the red-white-and-blue from factories in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> Those countries' lower labor costs enable them to sell flags at a lower price and American producers are starting to feel the pinch, <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>House Approves Eight-Year Pesticide Safety Deadline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved stepped-up pesticide regulation Tuesday, voting to set an accelerated, eight-year deadline for completion of safety reviews of hundreds of chemicals used by farmers to protect crops. The measure, approved and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on a voice vote, amounts to a bare-bones bill without groundwater-protection and other contoversial features urged by environmentalists. `` This is the art of the possible, this will not satisfy hardly anyone but this is what we can do at this point,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said in urging approval. He said lawmakers could return to the tougher issues in the future. The bill calls for completion of hundreds of safety reviews by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> within eight years. The process is designed to end use of the most hazardous chemicals and limit utilization of others that present health dangers. The reviews have been in progress since the mid-1970s but without a deadline. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates that at the current pace of about two dozen a year the task would not be completed until 2024. The bill would largely end indemnities to pesticide makers whose products have been ordered off the market for safety reasons. Thus far, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has been forced to pay $ 20 million to buy up supplies of banned pesticides. Provisions of the bill call for fees paid by manufacturers ranging from $ 50,000 to $ 150,000 to finance the reviews. The industry and the agency would share the cost of storage and disposal under the measure, which would reauthorize for three years the 1947 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Environmentalists say the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has been dragging its feet on the safety reviews because it lacks the money to pay the indemnities. The act has been due for reauthorization since 1983 but squabbling among environmentalists, labor and the farm lobby have frozen action. `` We have had difficulty in times past in trying to make this happen,'' Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Farmers have been highly suspicious of legislation they fear would ban or raise the cost of pesticides, which arose out of World War II chemical warfare research and now represent a fundamental element of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture. `` Certainly with regard to agriculture, the efficient and judicious use of pesticides is crucial to the safety of the food supply that we enjoy today,'' declared Rep. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>. Government research, however, has shown that some pesticides can cause cancer and other severe health problems. Environmentalists have been calling for tighter regulation since 1962 when naturalist <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> spotlighted the problem in her bestselling `` Silent Spring.'' Most environmentalists have been saying the current bill is better than nothing or, at least, would not make the situation worse. But they point to a lack of any component that would step up monitoring of groundwater, which provides the basic drinking supply for half of all Americans. A report issued last week by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an organization founded by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, said a search of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> records showed that 73 pesticides have been found in groundwater in 34 states. Moreover, some environmental groups were opposed to the legislation. `` We're not willing to put pesticide regulation on the back burner for three to four years,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> the Misuse of Pesticides. `` That's not any kind of message to be sending out across the country to people who are facing chemicals in their drinking water, chemicals in their workplace and chemicals in their food.''

 A federal jury Tuesday convicted a British aircraft broker of trying to sell 10 embargoed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 The five new Cabinet ministers approved by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament Tuesday include an ex-guerrilla who fought against the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, a former student who occupied the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and two ministers with graduate degrees from American universities. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, rejected a sixth appointee, the prospective minister of commerce <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedayatzadeh </PERSON>, in the second vote of confidence in Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>'s government in eight days. The Iranian news agency <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said the new Revolutionary Guards minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON>, 33, was a senior aide of Commander-in-Chief <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON> also was <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s deputy for operations and information at military command headquarters, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON> takes over from <PERSON> Mohsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafiqdoust </PERSON>, the victim of a no-confidence vote in the first parliament session on Sept. 12. That session was held amid criticism of the Revolutionary Guards, blamed for several battlefield defeats that led <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to accept a cease-fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war in July. The radio said <PERSON> Hedayatzadeh </PERSON> could not muster the necessary votes, with only 94 deputies supporting him. No one was given that portfolio in the first Cabinet <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> presented. It was not clear if the Majlis objected to <PERSON> Hedayatzadeh </PERSON>'s credentials or to the post itself. In the previous round, the ministers of agriculture and education were rejected. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalantari </PERSON> was installed as agriculture minister and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Najafi </PERSON> as minister of education. The Majlis approved <PERSON> Bijan </PERSON> <PERSON> Namdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Zangeneh </PERSON>, 36, construction minister until he resigned in July, as energy minister. <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Forouzesh </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Zangeneh </PERSON>'s aides, was installed as new minister of construction. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON> was a guerrilla in the underground campaign against <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> before the 1979 revolution that brought <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON> commanded the Revolutionary Guards along the southern front after the gulf war started in 1980 and later rose to the post of deputy commander of the guards. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said two of his brothers, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON>, died in the war. An Iranian political analyst, speaking in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON> was at one point entrusted with chasing dissidents opposed to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s fundamentalist regime, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Forouzesh </PERSON>, 33, was one of the students who took over the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in November 1979.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to appropriate an additional $ 108,000 for the special committee investigating the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and alleged mismanagement of natural resources such as gas and oil. Last November, the committee unanimously authorized a yearlong, $ 740,000 investigation into alleged fraud, mismanagement and malfeasance in the administration of housing, education and health programs. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs, said the investigation `` is the most professional I have seen,'' even more so than the Iran-contra of which he was the co-chairman. He said the special committee headed by Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., had issued 130 subpoenas and interviewed or taken depositions from over 300 individuals <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said there have been allegations of malfeasance, negligence and criminal activity in which the dollar sum may exceed $ 11 billion. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said the special committee would not be rushed in its investigation. He said hearings would be held early in 1989. When the <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> committee was formed last year, <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said the allegations of mismanagement `` extend to almost ever aspect of the administration of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> affairs, and include the development of Indian trust resources, and the management of housing programs, health programs, education programs, economic development initiatives, and the administration of law enforcement on Indian reservations.'' The special investigation was prompted by a series of articles in The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> last October. The newspaper reported that multi-million dollar federal Indian programs are plagued by fraud, incompetence and deceit. As an example, <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said 34 reports of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general and an equal number of reports issued by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the congressional investigative arm, since the early 1970s estimate that the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has failed to collect approximately $ 5.7 billion in oil and gas royalties from oil companies. <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reports also document another $ 5.8 billion worth of oil and gas that has been illegally siphoned off of Indian and public lands. An <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> account, he said, indicates that the resulting `` windfall to oil companies has been placed at more than $ 1 billion a year in studies by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and congressional panels.''

<HEAD>Drought Slows Price Rise In Farland; 1989 Recovery Seen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The drought appears to have slowed the recovery in farmland values, but appraisers think land prices will rise at a healthy clip in 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Rural appraisers surveyed in August by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported only a 1.2 percent increase nationally in farmland values for May, June and July, compared with a 1.8 percent gain in the first quarter of the year. `` While the appreciation rate for farmland could continue to slow in coming months, the appraisers were more bullish for the year ahead, expecting a 4.6 percent rise in values,'' the report said. `` Last May, surveyed appraisers anticipated only a 3.6 percent gain for the coming year.'' Farmland prices began rising in 1987, ending a 6-year decline that was part of the worst financial crunch in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture since the Depression. In a related report, the agency released new 1987 farm income statistics which showed state rankings for the first time. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, as usual, headed the list. Nine of the top 10 states for net farm income in 1987 were there in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> replaced <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1987. The top 10 states accounted for 54 percent of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> net farm income in 1987, compared with 54.5 percent in 1986. The new preliminary state estimates for 1987 showed net farm income nationally at $ 46.3 billion, up more than 23 percent from calendar 1986. Economists said the largest percentage increases were in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> gains were due largely to increased value of livestock product marketings,'' the report said. Higher cattle prices and livestock inventory reductions contributed. Improved farm income in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> resulted from increased production and higher prices for tobacco, potatoes, cotton and cottonseed. Generally, production increased from a relatively poor year in 1986. Net farm income is the difference between gross farm income and total expenses during a calendar year and measures the profit or loss associated with production in a given year. Additions to inventories are treated as income, and allowances are made for `` non-money `` items such as depreciation, the consumption of farm-grown food, and the net rental value of dwellings. The agency also uses a method of accounting for `` net cash income,'' which is the difference between gross cash income and cash expenses. Current sales from inventories produced in other years are counted as gross income. Net cash income is often preferred by some economists since it shows how much actual money farmers have to spend during a year. In 1987, net cash income was estimated at a record $ 57.1 billion, compared with the net income of $ 46.3 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has forecast 1988 net farm income may be in the range of $ 38 billion to $ 43 billion, and that net cash income could be $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion. `` Net farm income is typically much more volatile than net cash income because weather often causes sharp changes in production that lead to swings in inventory values,'' the report said.

 A heavyset white woman in her 40s is pictured in a drawing released by a federal agency Tuesday of a suspect in the July discovery of 13 time bombs planted in the small town of <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>. The bombs, which caused no serious damage, were found near buildings and under the bridges that provide the only access to the southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> community of about 6,000 people. The devices contained timers attached to as many as 26 sticks of gelatine dynamite and were packaged in paper grocery sacks. They were concealed at various sites in and near the downtown square.

A military explosives expert said at the time that the bomber either lacked the expertise to properly wire the bombs or did not have an essential component. Three of the dynamite bundles exploded, but produced only smoke and small fires. The 10 others were defused by bomb experts. No one was injured, but authorities said the bombs could have caused widespread destruction.

 For the eighth year running, the Oriental Hotel in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, has been rated the world's best hotel in a survey conducted by Institutional Investor magazine. Taking the next three spots were the Regent of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the Vier Jahreszeiten of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and the Mandarin Oriental of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, all holding the same rankings they had in 1987. The financial monthly magazine polls about 100 senior bankers from around the world who do a lot of traveling and asks them to rate their favorite hotels on a scale of 1 to 100. The top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hotel was the <PERSON> Carlyle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, rated No. 12. Five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hotels were in the top 25.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday excluded farmers and firefighters from a federal requirement that drivers of large trucks have a special license, saying these groups do not have a poor traffic safety record. The announcement came after several months of public hearings and protests from the farm community over new federal requirements that are aimed at anyone driving a truck weighing more than 26,000 pounds or any vehicles carrying hazardous cargo. Farmers have complained that the special license requirement as enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would cover drivers of large trucks carrying grain and hay, even some pickup trucks, bulk fuel and fertilizer tanks and firefighters driving emergency vehicles. The law provides for the department to allow exemptions. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said the states are being notified that they may exempt farm-to-market truck operators as long as the vehicles are used to transport agricultural products, farm machinery or farm supplies no more than 150 miles from home. `` Generally these vehicles have a better accident record than ` non-farm' vehicles of similar size,'' the department concluded. In 1982, the most recent year cited, the accident rate for farm vehicles was less than half the rate for non-farm vehicles, it said. Additionally, the department said, the states may exclude drivers of firefighting equipment operated by municipalities or volunteer fire departments as well as military personnel, including <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION>, who drive military vehicles. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted the law in 1986 to tighten control over drivers who drive large commercial trucks from state to state. It is aimed at ending the practice by some commercial drivers of obtaining licenses from a number of states to conceal traffic violations. The law also requires minimum standards for commercial drivers and a testing program. Both the licenses and testing continue to be administered by the states. At the same time, the department said it was rejecting requests for similar waivers to transit operators, railroad employees and public utility employees. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., principal author of the 1986 law requiring the special licensing, said he agreed with the department's decision `` The law ... was not intended to unduly burden farmers as they transport their grain to the silo or their crops to market,'' <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said in a statement.

<HEAD>Death Toll Rises to 140 in Flash Flood From Hurricane Gilbert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of confirmed dead in a flash flood caused by Hurricane Gilbert rose to 140 Tuesday, and authorities said a fifth passenger bus had been located in a drying river bed. `` We have recovered 140 cadavers. It's difficult to say how many more there could be. It could be very terrible,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimas </PERSON>, assistant information secretary for the <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> state government. <PERSON> Dimas </PERSON> said by telephone that most of the bodies were being found in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catarina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about 20 miles downstream from <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. Earlier, authorities said about 100 bodies had been recovered and estimated that 200 overall may have been killed in the flooding. Rains unleashed by <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> in the 14,000-foot-high mountains surrounding this state capital sent waters raging through the normally dry river bed on Saturday. The flash flood swept away five passenger buses and private vehicles that were traveling on roads built in the river bed. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catarina </LOCATION> divides <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, which has a population of 3 million and is the largest metropolitan area in northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The flash flood, the worst <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> has seen since 1909, also swept away squatters' homes, streets, electricity towers and miles of sports facilities that had built on the dry riverbed. State authorities estimated damage at $ 90 million. The torrent's destructive path extended for nearly 40 miles. Hundreds of homes were destroyed and thousands more flooded with water and mud. About 30,000 people remained in shelters Tuesday. <PERSON> Dimas </PERSON> said the fifth passenger bus had been located in the river bed 30 miles downstream from here. The bus is one of four intercity and one urban buses that were swept into the river in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. Army soldiers digging through rubble in the crushed and overturned skeleton of the local bus found two decaying bodies inside it on Monday, the daily <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Dimas </PERSON> said ranches in the mountain region around <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> and a village of about 100 families remained cut off Tuesday by flooding and mudslides. `` We're trying to find out what we can do to get supplies to these people,'' he said. The flood waters, which were 10 feet deep and 150 yards wide, had subsided to a shallow trickle about 15 feet wide by Tuesday. But many parts of the <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> area remained without water because of damaged pumps. Health authorities were recommending that citizens throughout the region boil water because of increased risk of viral and bacterial infections caused by contaminated water. `` The water treatment plants are working beyond capacity,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, state health secretary. `` The water could be contaminated with fecal matter and sediments,'' he said in a telephone interview. Apart from the damage and deaths in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, the storm killed at least 71 people and destroyed thousands of homes in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>

<TEXT>
 Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> spent his last day in office Tuesday berating <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and contending <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advisers `` tend to look down their noses at the basic and instinctive patriotism of a lot of the American people.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and Democratic presidential nominee, for vetoing legislation that would have penalized teachers unless they led their students in the Pledge of Allegiance. But in attacking the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> veto, which followed advisory opinions from the state attorney general and supreme court that the bill was unconstitutional, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> also agreed with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that any student who objects should not be required to recite the pledge. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters turned out in force to greet <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, terming him a hypocrite for criticizing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at a time when state spending on education has increased significantly and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had tried to cut programs and eliminate the Education Department. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, appearing at a news conference on behalf of Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had at best an average record on education and called his veto of the pledge bill `` his most famous educational act.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he would oppose such a law at the federal level because education is a state issue. But he said he supported state laws that required the pledge while excusing students who object on religious or other grounds. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> believes recitation of the pledge should be a voluntary tradition in schools, while <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> called for state laws that require recitation but do not penalize students who object. `` If you do n't like the Pledge of Allegiance you're going to hate the Declaration of Independence,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. In a 1986 assessment, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> praised improvements in SAT scores that moved <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> into the top third of states which administer the tests and also credited the state for putting `` in place important reforms to improve teacher quality through testing of new teachers, performance incentives and alternative certifications to attract the most qualified candidates into teaching.'' After being read those comments Tuesday, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` Check the record and see what belongs to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and what belongs to King,'' a reference to former Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. King. When told the teacher-quality legislation was part of a package <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supported in 1985, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` that may well be ... the governor's record itself is not distinguished.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, during a recent television appearance, said most <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advisers come from <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, communities where he said many residents have `` disdain'' for patriotism. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, whose tenure was marked by such outspoken and controversial comments, refused to apologize Tuesday but said he was referring specifically to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advisers. `` A lot of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> crowd, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advisers, do have, I think, a sense of intellectual superiority and do tend to look down their noses at the basic and instinctive patriotism of a lot of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. At the earlier meeting with reporters, <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> state Rep. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to visit her town, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, grew up and still lives. `` If Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> thinks <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> disdains basic <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values, he should visit our town and visit the Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korean War and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran memorials honoring <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> citizens who died to protect his freedom to insult their memory,'' <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Four inmates who were issued pink prison uniforms to show they have been exposed to the AIDS virus are suing the sheriff, contending the outfits stigmatize them and constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The complaint filed Monday was part of an amendment to a lawsuit the Orleans Parish Jail inmates already filed alleging they are kept segregated in cramped quarters and denied regular exercise, counseling and adequate medical care. Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Foti </PERSON> said he is not singling the inmates out for punishment or humiliation. Color-coded uniforms are used at the jail to designate the sections to which inmates are assigned, he said. Light pink, or rose colored, scrub suits are the color in the jail's infectious-disease unit, he said. `` If they were in white or green, would that make a difference?'' he said. `` What is pink? I wear pink all the time. Pastel colors _ that's a very soothing type of color.'' <PERSON> Foti </PERSON> said he recently adopted the color code because the cotton scrub suits and jump suits are lighter and easier to clean and keep track of. Federal prisoners wear blue, inmates who are housed in the tents in the prison yard wear white, and inmates in the prison's general medical ward wear green, <PERSON> Foti </PERSON> said.

 The House on Tuesday passed and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a bill aimed at permitting the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> to resume transfers of land to Western municipalities and counties for landfills.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Greens environmental group fared so well in elections last Sunday that they might not be able to fill all the seats they won on local and town councils, party officials said Tuesday. The Greens became the first new party in 70 years to make its way into <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s parliament, winning 20 seats in the 349-member Riksdag. Their popularity was boosted by ecological concern and a plague that killed thousands of seals in the northern seas, making the environment the top issue in the election campaign. The Swedish environmentalists became the second largest Greens party in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, winning 5.5 percent of the vote. Greens hold 43 seats in the West German Bundestag, about 9 percent of the total. Environmental parties also are in the parliaments of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. The Greens also won seats in 260 of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s 284 municipal councils. But party officials said that as of late Monday the loose-knit organization had no members to fill all its seats in 23 of them. Party official <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> said that in some districts the Greens had asked people not to vote for them for lack of local candidates, and urged them to support other local parties with strong environmental programs. But Greens ballots were available at all polling stations, and many voters ignored the call. In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, anyone can register as a candidate for local office simply by writing his or her name on the ballot. <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> said that when early opinion polls indicated strong support for the Greens, `` we had to urge our more reluctant, passive members to put their names down'' as candidates. `` Now there are a handful of cases where we have no members to take our seats,'' <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> said. He expressed concern that `` a perfect stranger'' hostile to the environmentalists could take a Greens seat. If no candidate is registered, the seat will remain empty for the three-year term. The Greens also face the question of whether to give up their decentralized ideology and organize a more rigid party machinery. They have virtually no national organization or official party leaders, but two people, <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Goes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Birger </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlaug </PERSON>, have emerged as semiofficial spokesmen. The Greens advocate abolishing nuclear power within three years, raising taxes on energy and allocating more funds to alternative energy sources. The party also campaigned for developing the railway system to take air-polluting cars and buses off the roads, stopping the burning of toxic waste, putting industry under stricter pollution controls, and encouraging biological farming. One problem the party's victory resolved was its financial debts from its unsuccessful 1982 election bid. As a sitting party in parliament, the Greens will receive government funds _ up to $ 1 million during its first year.

 Three men and a woman, their nude bodies found bound and gagged, were shot to death execution-style Tuesday, apparently in drug-related violence, authorities said. <LOCATION> Escambia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Seely </PERSON> refused to comment on reports that a woman survived the shootings, which occurred at 1 a.m. at a duplex in the unincorporated community of <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> just west of <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. But neighbor who did n't want to be identified said her son saw a woman in the middle of the highway, calling for help, just as an ambulance and sheriff's deputies arrived. There were several suspects but no arrests by midafternoon, <PERSON> Seely </PERSON> said. The bodies had not been positively identified. Police agencies across the state were alerted to watch for two cars believed to be heading toward <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, possibly traveling together. The notice said the occupants were to be considered armed and dangerous. A third car, a tan <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> sedan registered to a 24-year-old woman who lived at the address where the shootings took place, was found at the scene with blood stains on it. <PERSON> Seely </PERSON> said all the victims were in their early 30s and each was shot at least once. `` All of the victims were found nude, hands and feet tied and gagged,'' <PERSON> Seely </PERSON> said. `` All victims were shot in the head with a medium caliber pistol.'' <PERSON> Seely </PERSON> said there was no forced entry, but could not say if the victims knew the attackers. He had no comment on reports that at least one victim also was stabbed. He also would not identify the person who reported the shooting, and declined to say whether drugs or other evidence of narcotics dealing were found at the scene. But authorities said the slayings are believed to be drug-related because they were done execution-style. The neighbor said residents of both units in the duplex where the shooting occurred often went from one to the other. She said they had lived there about a year and kept to themselves. The people in the unit adjacent to where the shooting took place had children, the neighbor said. <PERSON> Seely </PERSON> refused comment on that report as well.

<HEAD>Anti-Gun Group Says Semiautomatic and Automatic Assault Weapons on
Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The popularity of semiautomatic or automatic assault weapons is increasing dramatically among criminals, especially among those trafficking in illegal drugs, an anti-gun group said Tuesday. The group said police officials across the country are concerned about how frequently criminals are found to possess high-powered automatic assault rifles or shotguns _ some capable of firing 30 rounds in a few seconds. `` The number of assault weapons in civilian hands _ both criminal and law abiding _ is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions,'' said a report by the Education Fund to End Handgun Violence, which keeps track of the firearms industry and favors tighter controls over the sale of guns. The group said there are no nationwide statistics available on the misuse of such assault weapons, but that police organizations, government agencies and pro-gun control groups agree the number of such weapons has increased dramatically in recent years. Assault weapons are characterized by having the capability of firing a large number of rounds on a single magazine, great muzzle velocity and compact design often including folding stocks that make it easier for the weapon to be concealed. The assault weapons `` are quickly becoming the leading topic in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s gun control debate and will most likely remain the leading gun control issue for the near future,'' the report said. It said automatic and semiautomatic weapons such as the AR-15, AK-47 and <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> are among the most popular weapons of drug dealers and are readily available in most states. `` For criminals, the weapons look intimidating, have increased firepower, and can be purchased under the same controls as a hunting rifle or shotgun,'' the report said. It said the weapons are popular not only among criminals, but also survivalists and `` rank-and-file gun aficionados.'' While the group said no national statistics were available on how many such weapons are in circulation, it said in 1987, almost one-third of the weapons seized by the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> were semiautomatic and 16 percent were fully automatic. Of the 388 guns seized by the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> police department during the first six weeks of this year, `` the vast majority were either semiautomatic or fully automatic,'' the report said. The study was conducted in conjunction with the New Right Watch, a group which monitors right wing organizations.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday there is insufficient evidence to seek indictments in the investigation of action taken by <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> city officials and police in the 1985 MOVE confrontation, which left 11 people dead and nearly two square blocks in flames. The investigation examined whether the officials or police violated the civil rights of those who died in the bombing and ensuing fire, said Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. `` We ... just found insufficient evidence to go forward with an indictment of anybody,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, head of the department's civil rights division, said in an interview. It was the second time a criminal probe of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> and others in connection with the MOVE incident has been concluded without indictments. A local grand jury in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> earlier this year strongly criticized city officials for their handling of the confrontation. Refraining from extensive comment, <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said he was happy that the investigation was over, adding: `` Two grand juries have fully investigated this matter and have reached a point of no criminality involved. For that I am pleased.'' The local grand jury discounted assertions that police gunfire in an alley behind the MOVE compound kept people from fleeing the burning rowhouse and <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said the federal probe also had examined that aspect of the matter. In a three-paragraph statement announcing the end of the federal probe, the department said no report will be issued by the fderal grand jury in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> which has been looking into the matter since April 1987. The panel based its inquiry on the work of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation launched in July 1985. `` It is a very positive thing ... to look forward rather than to look back ... and it really serves no purpose to go back and revisit and re-churn those waters,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said when asked why the government had decided not to press for a grand jury report on the matter. `` I feel quite strongly that the proper way for a prosecutor to proceed is to make his or her decision,'' announce it and `` nothing -LRB- is -RRB- to be served by any commentary after that.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> praised the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, said the statements of more than 250 witnesses had been carefully considered and that `` we are satisfied ... there is no basis for a criminal indictment based on our thorough review of all the evidence.'' Five children and six adults died inside the barricaded west <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> rowhouse on May 13, 1985, when police dropped a bomb on the dwelling in an attempt to evict MOVE followers. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> approved the use of a bomb, which contained the powerful military explosive C-4 and was dropped from a helicopter. The police bomb touched off a rooftop fire that soon raged out of control while fireman held back, afraid they would be hit by gunfire that had echoed through the neighborhood. The fire engulfed almost two square blocks and destroyed 61 rowhouses. Members of the mysterious MOVE group, whose name did not stand for anything in particular, championed back-to-nature rituals, lived in filth, refused to send their children to school, and openly disobeyed health and safety laws. Neighbors had complained to city officials and threatened to take matters into their own hands if nothing was done about MOVE. An investigating commission said the group `` had evolved into an authoritarian, violence-threatening cult.'' <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said at the time the local grand jury report came out that it `` laid to rest the MOVE commission's finding and other allegations that police gunfire prevented MOVE members from fleeing the burning compound'' through the back alley. The local grand jury said it considered but discarded charges of conspiracy, murder, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, arson, causing or risking a catastrophe, failure to prevent a catastrophe, criminal mischief and perjury. Only two people escaped from the house _ a female MOVE member known as <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> <PERSON> Africa </PERSON> and then-13-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, known to MOVE members as <PERSON> Birdie </PERSON> <PERSON> Africa </PERSON>. All MOVE members adopted the surname <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and most of them were black. A <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> policeman was killed in a 1978 confrontation with MOVE members.

 Western opinion polls showing hostility toward nuclear weapons and rising popularity for Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> present a challenge for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to better explain and sell its basic defense policy, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` For all of these -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- countries, it means a requirement for explaining defense policy and ... the approach to dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'' from a position of strength, she told a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> hearing. `` Arms control negotiations to achieve a proper defense at the lowest possible level require a very long and elaborate public presentation.''

 Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> announced the formation of an advisory panel Tuesday, a move <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members charge is an attempt by City Hall to take over operation of the city's 120 public schools. The mayor denied the panel is a power play for control of the system, which has come under criticism. The commission includes educators, business community leaders, two city councilors, and state Higher Education Commissioner <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenifer </PERSON>. The panel will advise <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> on such issues as educational policy, a student assignment plan, teacher morale and school governance, the mayor said. School Committee President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> said the mayor, considered a likely candidate for governor in 1990, is moving to take over the schools and enhance his image for a possible gubernatorial bid. `` I do n't think anyone should kid themselves into thinking this is n't politically motivated,'' <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> said. `` The mayor is looking to a governor's campaign, and he would like to crisscross the state and say he did something about schools.'' The mayor denied the accusation. `` I do n't think there's anybody in the city of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> who's satisfied with the level of the education,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said `` Public education is not the domain of the school committee or the superintendent of schools alone, it's a city problem. ... We all have a vested interest in public education in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.'' Committee member <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, who has been invited to sit on the panel, said public concerns that the school system is not doing all it can to improve education are not new, `` So this blue-ribbon panel is not sending any different message than is n't out there already,'' she said.

 An Armenian activist said about 400,000 people jammed the main square of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> Tuesday night and heard renewed demands for <LOCATION> Armenian </LOCATION> annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, where reports said a curfew was imposed and a bomb damaged a workers' dormitory. New violence hit the disputed territory over the weekend, with one man said to have been killed and at least 25 people officially reported injured. The Armenian activist, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, said many residents in the Armenian capital who struck last Friday remained off the job Tuesday, vowing to stay out until the Armenian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, met in new session to reconsider their annexation plea. In a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said members of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group pressing for annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, told the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> crowd that one-third, or 115 members, of the republic's Supreme Soviet signed a request for a new session. `` At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, people will be on the square waiting for an official announcement,'' <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said. He said that according to law, the session must be held if one-third of the Supreme Soviet members request it. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said committee members also told the crowd that a curfew was in effect in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the main city of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, a 46-year-old former political prisoner, said he had no details. The predominantly Armenian population of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a mountainous region of the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, began agitating in February for annexation to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Ethnic riots broke out in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, an industrial city of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, at the end of February, that left at least 32 people dead. The area, in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> region near the <LOCATION> Turkish-Iranian </LOCATION> border, has been tense since then. According to the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency, Armenians and Azerbaijanis traded shots Sunday in <LOCATION> Khadzhaly </LOCATION> village in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. An editor at the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Azerinform </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> said in a telephone interview that a 61-year-old carpenter injured in the clash died Monday in a hospital. The editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not know whether the man was an Armenian or an Azerbaijani. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 25 people were hurt in the fighting, but <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said reports in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> reported up to 70 injured. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Volchek </PERSON>, an editor of the unofficial <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> journal Glasnost, said a bomb exploded Monday at a dormitory housing Armenian construction workers in <LOCATION> Abovyan </LOCATION>, a few miles from <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said no one was hurt. He said a leaflet found at the site called the blast a `` present to residents of <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION>.'' Calls did not go through to <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>. Operators said the telephone line was down. In a possible prelude to greater police activity in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> called for order. `` The people are demanding that law and order be enforced everywhere. Law-enforcement services along with the public are taking necessary measures,'' it said. Officials in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> said police patrols were increased, but <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said police made no effort to break up the meeting Tuesday night. The Armenian parliament in June asked the national Supreme Soviet to permit <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The central government rejected that demand and offered instead a plan of social and economic development. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said many workers were showing restraint, ensuring normal operation of farms, transportation and factories, `` but all the same, irresponsible elements, first of all in the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> autonomous region, continue working up tension, provoking disorders and resorting to arson and other illegal activities.'' <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said stores, farms, food processing plants and transportation were operating in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, but many other enterprises and schools were closed. He estimated that 1 million people attended a Monday night gathering in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. A duty officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> said more than 250,000 people attended. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said several meetings were held in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> as well. A new strike was called last week in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, where workers were off their jobs for weeks during the summer. In <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> on Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Vezirov </PERSON>, told a meeting of local officials the clashes were part of `` anti-social activities'' that must be combated with work among the people and stricter control over law-and-order, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Armenians are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>; most Azerbaijanis are Shiite Moslem. Armenians also differ linguistically and culturally from ethnic Azerbaijanis.

No charges have been filed against the firm. `` At this point in time our interest is in fasteners,'' <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON> said. `` I would expect more indictments.'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON>, chief of the quality engineering division at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said the false certifications were uncovered during an audit in February and March. `` There are some of <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION>'s bolts on the shuttle, we know that,'' he said. `` We've actually gone in and evaluated where these bolts were and in any critical application, we conducted extensive stress analysis and determined there was no safety issue.'' <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON> said the shuttle's right booster contains 614 <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> bolts and the left booster has 595 and that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> bolts account for 60 percent of the 2,000 bolts inside the rockets. `` Even with those bolts that were in there, I could n't say we would have a problem with them,'' <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON> said. `` But they just did n't meet all the requirement we have. We want to assure ourselves all bases are covered.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was indicted Sept. 9 by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, on 26 counts of making false statements to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and 17 counts of mail fraud involving shuttle bolts made by <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> and Supply of <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. In the <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> case, federal authorities said the cost of identifying and removing the suspect bolts was $ 1 million, an estimate that <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON> called conservative. <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> faces up to five years in prison and a fine of $ 10,000 each on the false statement counts and five years and $ 1,000 fines on each count of mail fraud. <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON> said 357 bolts were taken off the two booster rockets in May or June, all made by <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Engineering </PERSON>. He said no defective bolts were found among those tested. `` There are military specifications that set the standard for bolts,'' <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON> said. `` Some bolts must meet a certain threshold or be able to withstand certain pressures. Others might have to meet certain chemical specifications so they do n't rust and deteriorate. The testing is done either by the manufacturer or supplier and they certify to us that this has been done.''

 Educators gathered Tuesday to grapple with the practical and philosophical problems that would confront teachers in developing a kindergarten-12th grade curriculum on the national holiday honoring slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` If we teach the principles of nonviolent social change to the kids from kindergarten, what do we do when they stage a walkout?'' one educator asked. The answer, from <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> of the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for Non-Violent Social Change: `` You have to teach them the principles of non-violent social change, let them know that civil disobedience was the last step following long period of negotiation.'' Teaching dilemmas, parental reaction, lack of course materials, training and faculty support were some of the issues raised during the mini-convention on `` Infusing Educational Materials Related to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, into the Curriculum of the Nation's Schools'' sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the King center Committee members included <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>; Sister <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Manya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungar </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, and Mrs. <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>, King's sister. Saying she hoped this would be `` the first of many,'' conferences designed to make available audio-visual materials, training programs and other classroom aids, <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said, `` You can not simply go out and say ` I'm going to teach about the life of Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>' unless you know about his life, unless you understand and have resources available.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said the purpose of the convention was to give the participants an opportunity to come together and `` talk about how we teach about King and how we inculcate that into the curriculum.'' Many of the speakers discussed the problems associated with their particular constituent groups. `` One problem is that no one has ever been really taught about King,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambach </PERSON> of the Council of Chief State School Officers. `` You have to recognize that an association like mine is _ predominantly white, Anglo-Saxon, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION>, middle class and suburban,'' said <PERSON> Ungar </PERSON> of the national PTA. `` The board members with which I deal ... are not reflective of the greater society _ particularly that portion of society which increasingly has problems getting their voices heard and their agenda addressed,'' she said. She noted that her group was reaching out to other organizations, such as the Anti-Defamation League, to help produce literature by next June. The <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> board, which prepared itself through training in human relation skills and a task force for inclusiveness, suggested that the state and local chapters initiate programs which `` demonstrate a commitment to the things that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> espoused and stood for,'' she said. `` To do this, the parents have got to educate themselves and find out who <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> was,'' <PERSON> Ungar </PERSON> said. `` We hope to have literature aimed at the parents, talking about how we either overtly or covertly teach prejudice, teach racism or perpetuate this cycle of hatred and violence,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 A man who recovered from a brain tumor and the amputation of his leg following a battle with the cancer that claimed the lives of all his male family members was sworn in to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> bar Tuesday. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON>, 28, stood on one leg and metal crutches, smiling proudly as he recited the oath of admission before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON>. `` I am proud to welcome you as a member of the legal fraternity,'' <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said, stepping down from the bench to shake the jubilant <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON>'s hand. An apparent genetic defect is responsible for the cancer that has followed the Southerlands for at least four generations, the family's physician, Dr. <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampkin </PERSON>, said earlier this year. <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> died of leukemia in 1967 at age 4. His father, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON>, 43, died of a brain tumor in 1981, and his brother <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, 16, died of a rare spinal cancer later that year. The only other family survivor is his mother, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Southerland-McMillen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON> was hopeful he had the cancer beat after his left leg was amputated in 1974. He dreamed of becoming a lawyer and began studying for the bar exam in 1986. Then he suffered a seizure and collapsed during a softball game. Doctors found a golfball-sized malignant brain tumor lodged deep in the left side of his brain and decided to operate. `` It was the best excuse in the world not to take a bar exam,'' he joked at the time. The operation removed any trace of cancer, doctors told him. <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON> began working full time at a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> law firm and lifting weights three times a week to regain his strength. He took the bar exam in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> on July 26 and 27. `` At 9:30 on Monday, I learned I passed the bar,'' <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON> said after his swearing-in. `` A friend of mine who's a clerk at the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> called me to tell me.'' Handling his crutches with ease, <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON> hugged his mother and his stepfather and thanked the small crowd of friends for their support over the years. The judge, who like <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> graduate, said he was impressed by <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON>'s courage when they met at a Christmas party last year. He promised then to officiate at <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON>'s swearing-in if he passed the bar. <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON> said his plans to practice civil law have put his social life on the back burner. `` Right now all I'm concentrating on is my law career,'' he said.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> was elected president of the 43rd General Assembly Tuesday and promptly denounced developed nations for their `` pitiless system'' of piling up Third World debt. <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> was swiftly elected after the 159-nation world body convened in a mood of optimism and conciliation over many international issues, despite the bitter presidential contest between <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>' ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Nita </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>. In his inaugural speech, <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> set the tone for his yearlong presidency of the world body which is dominated by poor, developing nations and distanced himself from much of the industrialized West. <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> cited `` the contrast between political peace and economic injustice ... the widening of the gap between rich countries and a large part of the developing world.'' The 47-year-old former professor and politician was elected by a vote of 91 to 66, with one abstention in secret balloting by 158 nations. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the 159th member, is disqualified from voting. The abstaining nation was not identified. The post is largely ceremonial but the president has great prestige and can wield considerable influence in setting agendas, limiting speeches and setting the tone for debate. <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON>'s election was a major setback for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which lobbied against him and for <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Nita </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> were foes in the Falklands War of 1982 _ won by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> consistently has taken <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s side. The race was expected to be close, but <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> won handily over the 71-year-old nurse and public health expert who became the <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> envoy in 1986. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not disclose its secret vote. Diplomatic sources said <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON>, who had been courting black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, won many votes in the non-aligned movement. He also won votes of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and socialist countries; <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>; Arab nations, which need Argentine food, and some European nations which have emigrant ties to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the sources said. <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON>, named foreign minister in 1983 by President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, last month expelled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s consul for organizing a conference in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> without proper diplomatic clearance. In his speech after Tuesday's election, <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> praised the improved atmosphere for international cooperation betwen East and West. <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> cited <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> achievements in the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> cease-fire, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> settlement, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> and other areas. He also denounced the continuing `` infamous practice of apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' refering to that country's policy of racial segregation. He pointed to the `` sharp deterioration of the situation'' in Israeli-occupied territories. He called for an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and supported the right of all states in the region to exist within safe boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. But he reserved his strongest comments to condemn the economic gap between the industrialized and the developing world. <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> noted `` the remarkable difference between all the progress made toward ensuring world peace and the little, or nothing we have done to prevent the widening of the gap between rich countries, and a large part of the developing world.'' He said one of the clearest examples `` of this impotence is the question of the external debt of the developing countries: No structural improvement has taken place for the debtors since the outbreak of the the crisis in 1982.'' The Argentine envoy warned that high interst rates, `` together with the pitiless system of successive refinancing plans, and the perverse outflow of financial resources of indebted countries to credtors will end up eliminatng possibilities of investment for the developing world.'' <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has a foreign debt of $ 56 billion, the third highest in the developing world. Of the three sources of global conflict _ East-West tension, regional conflicts and the `` unfair relationship between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and South'' _ a major <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> effort must be directed toward helping the developing world, <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> said. He said Northern nations ensured their own wealth by imposing poverty on developing nations, but emphasized that the industrialized nations need the development of other nations to consolidate their own progress. `` They need it,'' he said, `` because development guarantees peace in the Third World and global security and because expansion of trade of developed countries will depend increasingly on growth of economies of the South.''

 Resumption of suspended negotiations on the future of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> could depend on the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> foreign minister's planned talks here Wednesday with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, a senior <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> aide said Tuesday. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papoulias </PERSON> is scheduled to meet and have lunch with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in his capacity as current representative of the European Common Market, but U.S.-Greek relations also will be covered, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> told a congressional panel. Negotiations in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military bases were suspended Sept. 5 when Ambassador <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator, returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for instructions on a `` major element'' in the Greek position. That was identified as a demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to vacate <LOCATION> Hellenikon </LOCATION> air base at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said. Resumption was tentatively scheduled for October, but the date is undecided and `` whether it takes place'' depends partly on talks with <PERSON> Papoulias </PERSON>, she told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and Middle Eastern Affairs. `` The disposition of <LOCATION> Hellenikon </LOCATION> will have to be resolved ... how it is going to be dealt with affects the whole negotiations,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> did not disclose the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to the demand for its planes to leave <LOCATION> Hellenikon </LOCATION>. She said in answer to a question that if agreement can not be reached, `` we have procedures for leaving'' but `` we are not at any stage of starting that at this time.'' Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., asked if the illness of Prime Minister <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, reported to be facing heart surgery, would affect the base negotiations The Greek government has said repeatedly that foreign policy is unaffected by <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s illness and officials have been instructed to carry on their functions, Ms. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> replied. As to whether the base negotiations would be completed before parliamentary elections, she said this was uncertain because setting of the election date is linked to the prime minister's health Ms. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> was also asked about the status of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, covered by an agreement that runs into 1990. `` We are prepared to negotiate with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> on the renewal of that agreement in good order,'' she said. `` I think it is a good agreement. We are happy with it, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is happy with it as far as I know.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> praised the rival <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> leaders for meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices in August and September and agreeing to meet again. `` We continue to support strongly a negotiated settlement of the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem,'' she said, declaring that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> `` enjoys our full support.'' Asked to explain what members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> termed `` conflicting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Turkish reports'' about Iraqi use of poison gas against the Kurdish minority in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said most of the Kurds who managed to reach <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> were those who escaped the attacks, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> findings were based partly on evidence not available to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Asked if <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> were barring <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts from investigating the issue, she said the whole matter was under discussion and not yet resolved.

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is still unknown to many voters despite more than a year of campaigning, says an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll released Tuesday. The survey, which gave Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a 50 percent to 46 percent lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said 54 percent of the respondents thought they did not know enough about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. That compared with 70 percent who said they think the vice president is a known quantity. The survey of 1,271 likely voters, begun a week ago and concluded Monday, also found that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was favored over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> among voters who consider themselves independents. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus three points. The survey also examined which issues were important to voters and how strong they considered each candidate on those issues. According to the survey, six out of ten respondents considered holding down taxes to be a very important issue, and of that group 54 percent thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would do a better job while 43 percent thought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would. Of the two-thirds of the respondents who thought preserving American family values to be a `` cutting edge'' issue, 52 percent supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 44 percent supported <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But on the issue of creating new jobs, which two-thirds found important, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was favored over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 53 percent to 43 percent. Neither candidate led on fighting drugs and crime, holding down the deficit and protecting the environment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was ahead among voters who were concerned about issues such as the Pledge of Allegiance, the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> and anti-abortion legislation, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was favored by those who consider college aid and child care to be important issues. A week ago, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a 48-45 lead. That survey also had a three-point margin of error.

 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> rebels fired a rocket into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Tuesday that killed at least 62 people and injured 104, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said two terrorists preparing a bomb for an act of sabotage in another Afghan city were killed when the device exploded. A 9-year-old girl also died in the explosion, it said. `` As a result of the attack -LRB- on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> -RRB- 62 innocent people, including women and children, were killed and 104 were wounded,'' Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. It gave few other details. The report tended to reinforce claims by Western sources that U.S.-backed Moslem insurgents have surrounded the heavily-fortified Afghan capital, attacking government and Soviet-held positions. In another report Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said 10 people were killed when six surface rockets `` launched by extremist opposition elements'' slammed into various parts of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. It was not immediately clear whether the 10 fatalities were included among the 62 reported killed. The report said since the April 14 signing in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> of an accord providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, anti-communist rebels have rocketed the city 16 times. The 16th attack occurred Tuesday, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also reported Tuesday that Afghan soldiers captured 14 caches of arms near <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that contained more than 700 surface-to-air missiles. Afghan soldiers moved into <LOCATION> Lalnadar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorge </LOCATION>, about 12 miles south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, after they received intelligence about the arms supplies hidden there, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Two battalions of Afghan soldiers, supported by Soviet artillery, cut off roads leading out of the gorge, but most of the rebels escaped via mountain paths, it said. `` In all, Afghan troops discovered 14 depots containing 724 surface-to-air missiles, 132 anti-tank and 280 anti-personnel mines, U.S.-made remote-control explosive devices and other weapons,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Also discovered were submachine guns, grenades, bazookas, and an anti-aircraft gun on a rotating platform, it said. It said the rebels launched missiles at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from a nearby mountain ridge, and then scattered because of retaliatory strikes that usually followed. It was not clear if the attack reported by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> was the same offensive reported Tuesday by Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also did not say when the weapons were captured from the insurgents, who are seeking to oust the Soviet-backed government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted the Afghan news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> as saying the accidental bombing occurred in the <LOCATION> Khushkhal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mena </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> but did not say when. It did not say whether the terrorists were aligned with anti-communist rebels. Moslem guerrillas have been fighting the ruling communists in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since they seized power in a 1978 military coup. Soviet forces entered the conflict to back the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government in late 1979. Under this year's <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, all of the estimated 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops are to leave the country by Feb. 15.

<HEAD>U.S. Forsees No Changes in International Economic Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The annual gathering of finance ministers and other economic officials at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> beginning this week in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is unlikely to produce a major change in world economic policies, according to a senior <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. `` The world economy ... is in the best shape that we've seen for a very considerable period of time,'' said the official on Tuesday, adding that American policy will continue steady during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final months in office. `` Our principal objectives will be to assure our partners of the continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to and support for the economic policy coordination process and the debt strategy,'' said the official. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials also would try `` to build on the considerable progress being achieved in promoting a sound world economy and a stable financial system.'' The <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> meeting will be the first opportunity for new <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to get acquainted with his foreign counterparts, the official noted. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was confirmed as secretary earlier this month to replace <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who resigned to head <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign. `` Inflation remains moderate and while continued vigilance is needed on that front, there is no evidence of generalized price pressures emerging,'' the official said. He said `` external imbalances,'' like the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and the Japanese trade surplus, `` are coming down, more quickly in fact than many people projected, as the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures have recently confirmed.'' He said economic growth in the major industrial countries this year will be approximately 4 percent, with continued expansion next year. During the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> meeting, the wealthiest countries, known as the Group of Seven or <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION>, plan to review their coordinated approach to the world economy to see if it can be strengthened, the official said. `` We expect the participants of that meeting to reaffirm the policy directions that have been adopted, including the understanding on exchange market cooperation,'' the official said. In recent years the G-7 countries have worked together to lower the value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and raise the West German deutsche Mark and Japanese yen on exchange markets. This has lowered the price of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports and made them more competitive in the world market, helping to narrow the difference between what the amount of goods and services the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> exports and imports. The official said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government continues to stand by its approach to easing the Third World debt burden as fundamentally sound and believes `` that significant progress has been and is being achieved.'' The approach, outlined in 1985 by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, called on commercial banks and international lending agencies to increase loans by $ 29 billion to the poorest 15 countries of the world in exchange for moves by those countries toward free-market economies. Lending by the commercial banks, however, has fallen $ 20 billion short of what the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan envisioned. This has prompted other countries, most notably <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, to suggest alternatives. The official said `` debt-for-equity'' swaps used by some Latin American countries to reduce their indebtedness showed promise. Under the procedure, governments grant commercial banks shares in government-owned businesses in exchange for forgiveness of the government debt to the banks. `` Debt-equity swaps have totaled $ 9 billion dollars by our estimate in the last 18 months or two years,'' said the official. `` There's room for substantially more activity of this kind if various debtor countries would further open their markets and remove foreign-investment restrictions.''

<HEAD>House Bill Would Allow Federal Agencies' Exit From Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House on Tuesday passed a bill that will allow federal agencies to locate in suburbs outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, a move city officials said would mean a substantial loss in local taxes. The bill, which amends a 1959 law requiring that federal agencies be housed in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, was prompted by concern that federally-leased land within the city had become too expensive. The bill, passed by a voice vote, now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` This legislation is important in that it would provide needed flexibility in the location of certain executive agencies in the national capital region at a significant savings to the government,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Average lease rates in the nation's capital range from $ 27 to $ 37 a square foot, compared to only $ 18 to $ 22 per square foot in Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and $ 22 to $ 31 per square foot in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> noted. A recent study by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the agency which handles all federal land purchases and rental agreements, found that $ 6 million could be saved on a 10-year lease of 100,000 square feet if a federal agency moved to a suburban location. Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, the bill's chief sponsor, said more than 50 independent agencies would be allowed to relocate outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. However, the legislation would not allow the principal offices of the 13 Cabinet-level agencies to move outside the District. `` The fact of the matter is that we have the opportunity in many cases to lease equivalent space nearby in the suburbs at half of what it would cost to stay in the District,'' said <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>. `` We're not anticipating any large mass-scale exodus, but this could save millions and millions of taxpayer dollars.'' But while the bill could ultimately mean a savings for federal taxpayers, city officials said they will be scrambling to make up for the lost revenue. `` This takes a lot of federal lease space in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> and sends it out to the suburbs,'' said <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON>, the city's intergovernmental liason officer `` What we will lose is sales tax revenue from federal employees eating and shopping in the city.'' <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON> did not know exactly how much tax revenue the city would lose.

 Cambodian rebel leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said Tuesday he would ask the French government to help him organize an international conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> `` as soon as possible.'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, said he would discuss the possibility of holding such a conference in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> when he meets President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on Friday. The prince, considered the key figure in a settlement to the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> civil war, told reporters he and Cambodian Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> planned to hold talks in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> starting Nov. 5. He said he has invited the two other leaders of the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance _ <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>, leader of a second resistance faction _ to participate in the November meetings. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s followers and the two groups form a resistance coalition whose aim is to remove Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and dismantle <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s government. `` There is a turning point now,'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said, adding that an international conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> should be held `` as soon as possible.'' He did not elaborate. The four parties involved in the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> civil war _ the three resistance groups and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnamese-installed government _ met for the first time in July in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> did not participate. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and Cambodian Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> planned the <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> talks at two meetings in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in December and January. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978 to end the three-year reign of terror by <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> chief. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has promised to withdraw its troops by the end of 1990. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said Tuesday he would insist that any Cambodian peace accord include a provision for the respect fo human rights. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> in the past has accused his <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> coalition partners of killing members of his <ORGANIZATION> Sihanoukist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, and on Tuesday claimed they recently sank 15 boats filled with food for his men.

<TEXT>
 The port of <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION> was under military control Tuesday as 750 port workers kept up a strike begun last week to demand payment of annual bonuses. They were joined this week by government employees with the same demand. Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> personnel are protecting <PERSON> Balboa </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> port of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. They said <PERSON> Vacamonte </PERSON> port police have taken control of that small fishing port, 30 miles from <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION>. Vacamonte workers are not on strike. <PERSON> Balboa </PERSON> workers went on indefinite strike Sept. 12, demanding the annual bonus that was due in August. On Monday, the 75,000-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> said they would join the strike for 48 hours. Federation undersecretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said workers at 80 percent of the government institutions were taking part. About half of those who collect taxes and utility payments continue to work to make sure the government will have the revenues needed to pay them. Employees at several government institutions told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> some people were working and some were not. The government maintains public employees do not have a right to strike. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said many striking public employees reported to work but did not perform their duties. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, private businesses operated normally. Schools, closed by the government Monday, were in session Tuesday. The 15,000-member Defense Forces, the country's armed forces, said in a statement it `` will guarantee that public service continues normally. `` Units of the police force offered to provide necessary vigilance to ensure that every state dependency, public service and the public in general have the necessary protection to carry out their functions,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said he was trying to gain the release of five <PERSON> Balboa </PERSON> labor leaders arrested over the weekend. Besides demanding bonus payments, federation members also asked that the government be restructured, accusing it of administrative corruption. The pro-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matutino </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that sectors of the federation rushed into `` an adventure'' by starting a strike that `` did not reach the level they expected.'' `` Many of the official institutions operated on time and with full personnel. Others worked partially,'' it said. Another <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> daily, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estrella </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said the strikes `` are counterproductive at a time when the country faces the worst economic crisis in its history and is confronted by the implacable aggression of the most powerful nation in the world.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to force Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to quit as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief, a post that makes him <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug trafficking charges.

 Men gathered at a cockfight acted `` like dogs'' during the gang rape of a woman near this southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town, a witness facing charges testified Tuesday. It was the first day of testimony in the trial of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garza </LOCATION>, 23, who is among 10 men charged in the kidnapping and sexual assault of a 19-year-old woman. All 10 men have entered innocent pleas. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> is the first defendant to go on trial in the case. In addition to the 10 adults, a 14-year-old also has been charged. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Briones </PERSON>, one of the men facing charges in the case, testified Tuesday that when he first saw <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> with the woman in a car near a shed where the cockfight was being held, she and <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> `` were necking.'' <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> said the woman later began offering resistance and that many of the 20 or more men present sexually assaulted the woman on the hood of <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>'s car while other men held her arms and legs. `` They were just like dogs,'' said <PERSON> Briones </PERSON>, who was offered probation in exchange for his testimony. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> is charged with sexually assaulting the woman, and also faces a kidnapping trial in connection with the case. Under state law, sexual assault is punishable by 2 to 20 years in prison and or fine of up $ 10,000. <PERSON> Briones </PERSON>, who also was charged with sexually assaulting the woman, said he fondled her, but denied raping her. He said the woman was groaning and crying while the men had sex with her. <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> said he remembered seeing the woman being forced to perform oral sex on <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>. Asked how many men assaulted the woman, he testified, `` I do n't remember because there were a whole bunch of them. Under questioning by defense attorney <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> said the woman was not resisting <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> while she and <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> were in the back seat of the car. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, in attacking the credibility of the witness, also produced a court-ordered competency report produced in June. In the report, <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> psychiatrist <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> told him, `` She was lying there letting everybody do it. She loved it _ no screaming from her. She was a run-around.'' <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> also told the psychiatrist that on March 26, the day he said the rape took place, he had consumed a case of beer, according to the report. <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> said Tuesday he did not remember telling <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> the woman participated voluntarily, and also said he did not remember being promised probation in exchange for testimony. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said that he would recommend probation for <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> in exchange for the testimony. Before testimony began Tuesday, the prosecutor apologized to the jury in advance for sexually explicit language they would hear in the trial. `` You will be hearing some language that is not dinner-table conversation that may offend you,'' he told the jury of six men and six women in the <ORGANIZATION> Duval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said the prosecution may take until Friday to present its case. Witnesses he has said will testify include the victim and a 12-year-old boy.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> proposed a broad health insurance program for American workers Tuesday and told <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` it's about time you came out from behind that flag'' and addressed the issue. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> draped himself in patriotism, visiting the nation's largest flag manufacturer. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, seeking support from working people, said the federal government should enact legislation requiring most employers to provide basic health insurance benefits for employees and dependents. `` I think it's time we did something,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He said he wanted to extend health insurance to all Americans, and that the first step would be to provide it to working people through their employers. Campaign aides said the first phase of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' program would give benefits to about 22 million people who have none, leaving 15 million or more Americans still awaiting protection under a national health insurance plan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign derided <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plan as `` socialized medicine'' and `` a prescription for financial disaster.'' Criticizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for what he said was a record of neglect and indifference on health care issues, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` Today he's visiting a flag factory Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, do n't you think it's about time you came out from behind that flag and told us what you intend to do to provide basic health care for 37 million of our fellow citizens.'' With their first face-to-face debate just five days away, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and Bowling Green, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a brief campaign hop to <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to visit the <ORGANIZATION> Annin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` My friends, flag sales are doing well and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is doing well,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has stressed patriotism in his campaign and has attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> bill that would have required public school teachers to lead students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. `` Americans have a new economic power, and I'm not going to let them take that away from you,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a rally outside the plant. He spoke in front of a huge American flag in a state regarded as a key battleground of the presidential race. The vice president returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in time to swear in fellow <PERSON> Texan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> as education secretary, the first Hispanic member of the Cabinet. Hispanics are a key voter bloc, particularly in states such as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have pledged to put a Hispanic-American at the Cabinet table. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, campaigned in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, telling a crowd of more than 1,000 at the state Capitol that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' policies `` are the policies of the past. Our policies are the policies of the future.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, addressing the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> insurance proposal, said he favors pilot projects and tax incentives to encourage businesses to provide insurance for workers. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, campaigned in the financially pinched Texas-Oklahoma oil patch, promising that a Democratic administration's energy policy would get American oil wells operating again with tax incentives and other subsidies. He promised <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would `` light a fire'' under federal regulators blocking the sale of natural gas to the Northeast. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> began the day in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where he visited <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON>, part of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Medical Center. In the waiting room of a cancer ward, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with a dozen patients and family members, asking about medical costs and health insurance programs. Saying it was time to address the problem, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added, `` If all goes well on the 8th of November, Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I are going to do something about it. Spread the word.'' Later, he flew to Bowling Green to outline his insurance proposal at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the son of a physician, said he intends to make sure that when Americans get sick, `` the first question they hear will be the question my father used to ask _ the question that doctors and nurses ask every day _ not ` how can you pay' but ` where does it hurt?''' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' health adviser, Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said the campaign had no estimate of how much <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plan would cost employers. If elected, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will appoint a task force to report by March 30, 1989, on legislation that would guarantee universal health coverage, extending benefits to every American, working or not, the campaign said. With <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> occupied on the campaign stump, his staff stepped in to criticize <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' health insurance proposal. `` This is socialized medicine and as such is a prescription for financial disaster,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> press spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>. `` The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plan would put the American economy in the hospital and would list it in criticial condition.'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said more than 82 percent of Americans under 65 are insured under private or Medicaid-type health insurance. He said that 75 percent of the workforce is covered by employer health insurance. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll released Tuesday showed the candidates practically tied. Although the numbers showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 50 percent to 46 percent, the margin of error of plus or minus three points washed out the lead. The survey of 1,271 likely voters was conducted Sept. 14-19. The survey found that 54 percent of the respondents do n't know enough about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, compared with 70 percent who found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be a known quantity. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was favored among respondents who considered holding down taxes and preserving <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> family values to be prime issues, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was favored among those who thought creation of new jobs to be a key issue. Although the debate is scheduled for Sunday, both sides were diputing how high the rostrums should be for the two candidates, said a source in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign who spoke on condition of anonymity. The source said the six-foot-one-inch <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> usually speaks at a 52-inch podium, but had already agreed to use a 46-inch one at the request of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. But on Tuesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> called and said aides to the five-foot-eight governor want it at 42 inches or 44 inches, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign source said. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, the source said, countered with a proposal that if it stays at 46 inches, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants to use a riser. That is unacceptable to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> people because it introduces `` artificiality'' the official said.

 Lobstermen who staged a 10-day strike to protest wholesale prices were back at work Tuesday after receiving assurances dealers would pay more in the future. The fishermen went back to work Monday in a `` good faith'' deal with buyers for future price increases, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousens </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lobstermen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were successful, but we paid for it dearly,'' <PERSON> Cousens </PERSON> said. `` But we put our point across and that's what we wanted to do. We did n't want to drive dealers out of business.'' <PERSON> Cousens </PERSON> estimated up to 400 lobster boats participated at one time or another during the strike, which began Sept. 9 and ended Monday. About 1,000 people have lobster-fishing licenses in the affected area, the middle coast of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Lobstermen staged the strike in hopes of raising the price paid by dealers for lobster from $ 2.10 per pound to the $ 2.25 per pound lobstermen to the north and south receive, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmore </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lobstermen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's no signed agreements or anything, but it was understood by the group involved they were going to go back and get prices at the $ 2.25 level, which is what they thought they -LRB- needed to -RRB- operate and make a living at,'' <PERSON> Blackmore </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>2nd Blaze In 3 Days Near Subway Station Where 31 Died Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fire in a tunnel Tuesday night delayed subway services at King's Cross station, the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> fire service reported. It was the second fire in the same spot in three days, but no injures were reported in either blaze. On Nov. 18 last year, 31 people died and 80 were injured when fire broke out under an escalator at <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway system's busiest station. The fire service said in a statement that in Tuesday's incident, trash that had accumulated in the tunnel beween King's <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and Euston, the next subway station down the line, caught fire but was quickly extinguished. It said that on Saturday, services were briefly disrupted after a small fire broke out at the same spot. That fire burned itself out before emergency crews arrived to tackle it. The statement did not say what was thought to have caused the fires on Tuesday and Saturday. Investigators believe the Nov. 18 fire was started when a lighted cigarette was dropped on a wooden escalator surrounded by grease-soaked trash. The fire raced up the escalator and a ball of flame exploded in the ticket lobby. Smoking has been banned throughout the subway system following the Nov. 18 fire. But an independent inquiry into that fire expressed concern last June at the end of a 91-day hearing that senior managers of <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, the public corporation that runs the subway, might not accept the lessons of that disaster. The inquiry's chief counsel, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, accused senior managers of seeking to shirk responsibility for the fire. The managers defended existing safety procedures but during the inquiry announced a package of 101 new safety measures.

 Firefighters used a 20-foot-wide blackened dirt barrier to keep a 4-day-old arson fire from advancing on homes near a road outside city limits, despite erratic winds Tuesday. Firefighters ordered the evacuation of 500 people along a 10-mile stretch of <LOCATION> Pleasants </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, just west of city limits, fearing that afternoon winds could fan the blaze toward scattered homes near the road. The residents were allowed to return to their homes by Tuesday night. `` The backfire operation was pretty darn successful. The wind has cooperated,'' said <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Landuyt </PERSON>, fire camp spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. The Miller fire, named for the canyon in which it began, has burned 22,000 acres since it started Saturday. Seven homes were destroyed Sunday. It is one of two major <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> blazes that have destroyed 31 homes and about 30,000 acres of wildland, brush and timber since the weekend. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> on Tuesday proclaimed states of emergency for Shasta and <LOCATION> Solano </LOCATION> counties, the first step in making state and federal aid available to victims of the wildfires. Elsewhere across the West, however, the situation was improved as the worst summer for fires in three decades wound to a close. In all, nearly 70,000 fires have been tallied, blackening more than 4.1 million acres, about half of them in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` I think fire season is just about over here,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Madelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kempf </PERSON> said Tuesday as crews broke camp and began departing from the 34,500-acre Red Bench fire in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s Glacier National Park. It rained `` almost all last night,'' she said. Some 200 firefighters also left <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, although others remained behind to finish firefighting efforts there. In <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, `` things are very calm,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Karle </PERSON>. Officials Monday released 1,000 soldiers who had spent more than 30 days battling flames that blackened nearly half the 2.2 million-acre park. Temperatures in the park reached only the 40s Tuesday, but forecasts called for 60s and 70s later by Friday. Fire behavioralist <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Freet </PERSON> said just two days of dry weather could spell a return to the active burning seen two weeks ago. Outside <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> watched as firefighters burned brush around his $ 675,000 <LOCATION> Pleasants </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> home as part of their attempt to stop the fire at the road. `` We just moved in. What a heck of a housewarming,'' said <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, 42. `` I hope they catch the sucker that started this, put him in jail for a hundred years and throw away the key,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, 18, another <LOCATION> Pleasants </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> resident. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>, a captain with the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>, said firefighters were optimistic that the blaze would n't jump the road, but said afternoon winds could push the fire to the homes west of the road The fire was 50 percent contained, or surrounded, at midday Tuesday. `` If today goes well for us, we should have 100 percent containment Thursday,'' <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> said. The fire Monday came to within one half-mile of the <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION> city limits, but did not threaten the populated area of the city of 51,000 45 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The 7,800-acre Fern fire near <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>, 220 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, was 75 percent contained Tuesday morning, but winds were hampering firefighters there, too. `` I'm looking at the flag and it's standing straight out,'' said forestry department spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Just </PERSON>. Six people have been injured in the Fern fire, including a man listed in critical condition after a tree fell on him when he was clearing burned timber. The fire also destroyed 24 residences, Just said. Earlier reports put the number of homes destroyed at seven, but officials said Tuesday that a recount showed other homes, chiefly mobile homes, had also burned Sunday or Monday. The Fern fire started when someone shot out an insulator from a power line about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> fire has been determined to be arson because all other causes were eliminated and truck tire tracks were found near where the fire started Saturday. There are no suspects.

 Sandinista government officials and Contra rebels blamed each other Tuesday for the breakdown of talks aimed at stabilizing a cease-fire in the 7-year-old civil war. The two sides held talks Monday in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in an attempt to reopen peace negotiations to end the war that has claimed more than 28,000 Nicaraguan lives. `` The interest of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> is to agree on a definitive cease-fire, which the Contras have rejected,'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, deputy foreign minister and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> negotiator, told the pro-goverment newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. Last week the Contras accepted the leftist government's proposal to hold the talks in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. But the U.S.-backed rebels said they would enter formal negotiations only after the release of 40 opposition leaders jailed in July during anti-government protests. The Sandinistas and the Contras on March 23 signed a pact, which provided for a temporary truce and high-level talks in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. But the Contras say they will participate in talks anywhere but the Nicaraguan capital, where they say their movement is restricted. The Sandinistas insist that <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> be the site of negotiations. `` This is a clear demonstration of the lack of Sandinista desire to establish or take measures and set up reforms that permit a democratic opening,'' said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, one of seven Contra leaders. He spoke Tuesday on the rebels' clandestine Radio Liberation. A series of meetings to set a timetable for the rebels to lay down their arms permanently and for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to institute democratic reforms ended in stalemate June 9. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, speaking on state-run radio Monday night, said the goal of the rebels was to make it appear the government was unwilling to bend so that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would resume military funding for the Contras. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid to the rebels Feb. 29. The Contras, citing Soviet supplies to the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION>, claim they need such aid to act as a bargaining chip in negotiations. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> are interested, through the Contras, to try to show that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has an intransigent position ... to approve military aid for the counterrevolutionaries,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` We should speak with those who pay the gunslingers and not talk with the gunslingers,'' the Sandinista leader said, referring to the repeated Nicaraguan call for bilateral talks with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` obsession'' with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has opened the possibility of a direct military invasion of his country by American troops. He said the number of American surveillance flights over <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> have increased after the March truce. The president also charged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has continued to supply the Contras and the `` unarmed Contras,'' an expression used to describe internal opposition groups. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> cited the U.S.-government linked <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, which he said provided more than $ 600,000 for opposition political parties and groups, including $ 47,000 for the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> opposition newspaper. As many as 10,000 Contras fled from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in the past five months to base camps in eastern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Congressional aid approved in March provides only for non-lethal goods to be distributed in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Contra sources say no more than 2,000 rebels remain inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In a related development, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> <PERSON> Brockmann </PERSON> said Tuesday that his government hopes to open direct talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president is elected in November. `` Until now this has been impossible, but we hope that with a new administration we can do this,'' <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. `` The future is black if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> does not decide seriously to redefine its vital interests in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to exclude the need to interfere in internal affairs,'' said <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON>, who is among delegates from 26 Latin American and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nations meeting in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> to discuss regional economic issues.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will soon resume negotiations on an agreement that could scale down <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of military bases in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and cut off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the strategic <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> country, a senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday. Preparations for relocating the supersonic F16 jets and crews of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 441st <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> air base outside <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> `` are going very smoothly'' said Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> insisted on removal of the 441st unit from the high-profile <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> base early in the current talks which, however will provide for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air and naval forces to continue using other Spanish installations. Testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on European and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> affairs, Ms. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> gave few details of the base negotiations, suspended in mid-summer and expected to resume soon. But Ambassador <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartholemew </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator has just returned to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, she said. `` Both governments wish to get this agreement behind us,'' she said. `` We remain hopeful that a basis for settling the few remaining issues can be reached soon.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> will not contribute to the estimated $ 500 million construction costs <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will pay for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unit's new facilities in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and under the new base agreement will not receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget austerity last year reduced <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to slightly over $ 100 million, down from $ 403 million in military credits and grants annually pledged in an expiring five-year agremeent between the two countries. Asked if the new arrangement would be consistent with <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s role in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> replied: `` <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has defined its role in the alliance as it deems appropriate for <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> ... I think that, while we might wish for more, the Spanish are very clear about what is possible, and that is what we are working on,'' she added. Meanwhile, another alliance member, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> recently restated to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon-State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> team its concern about declining levels of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid but declared it intends to continue providing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to <LOCATION> Lajes </LOCATION> air base in the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> `` had some good talks'' during consultations on broadening bilateral cooperation, she said. Another round of talks is expected in October, she added. The Portuguese government voiced concern last March that current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid of $ 117 million is little more than half the 1985 level.

 The case of three men charged in the kidnap-murder of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent slain in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> went to a federal court jury Tuesday. The jury got the case against the trio 3 -LCB- years after the death of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>, whose battered body was discovered at a ranch in the Mexican countryside. The defendants are alleged to have acted at the behest of Mexican drug baron <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>. Prosecutors contend <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s slaying to wreak vengeance for <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> assaults on his drug empire. Two defendants are charged with kidnap, murder and conspiracy, and one with being an accessory after the fact in the murders of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot. Defense attorneys argued the three are scapegoats of a government intent on closing the books on the politically volatile case, which disrupted relations between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Jurors who heard eight weeks of testimony were instructed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON>, then received the case. They selected a foreman then retired until Wednesday to begin deliberating. Earlier in the day, a prosecutor delivered his final statement, denouncing defense lawyers for `` outrageous and obscene'' arguments. He called for conviction of all defendants. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Roel </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, in a rebuttal that drew a barrage of objections from the defense and an unsuccessful motion for mistrial, said the lawyers had stooped to unwarranted personal attacks on the prosecution team. He denounced `` this tactic of personal slander.'' `` They have accused us of somehow presenting perjured testimony, of somehow coaching witnesses,'' said <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>. `` Ladies and gentlmen, did the prosecution in this case do anything improper? I'm here to tell you we did not.'' `` Special agent <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> died in the service of his country,'' <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> told jurors. `` He died in the same way a Marine on a foreign shore would die for his country.'' <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was abducted in the Mexican city of <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1985. His body and that of his pilot, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON>, were found buried at a remote ranch in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> several weeks later. They were severely beaten and <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s skull was crushed. <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> drew the loudest objections from defense attorneys when he reviewed the evidence against <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquidez </PERSON>, 36, and <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, 28, both charged with <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s murder. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> is a former Mexican state police officer. Verdugo is an admitted drug trafficker. Their lawyers said <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> was misstating evidence against them. A third defendant, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, 38, is charged with helping <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> escape from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s brutal murder. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>, moved for a mistrial after <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> told jurors that the defendants do not face the death penalty. He said he was responding to a defense statement that the defendants `` are fighting for their lives.'' They face a possible maximum of life imprisonment. <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON>, who denied the mistrial motion, nevertheless instructed jurors to disregard the subject of penalties, which he said was `` entirely taboo.'' `` Your job,'' the judge said, `` is to reach a verdict regardless of what the consequences might be.'' The case stirred bitter feelings between Mexican and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials after Mexican police officials were linked to the killing and to <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>'s escape to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Nine men were indicted in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in connection with the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> slaying, but only three are standing trial here. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>, 33, and three other defendants are in custody and awaiting trial on related charges in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. An eighth man has died and another is a fugitive.

Foreign Minister <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedregal </PERSON> said in a letter presented to <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> that `` the beginning of intense political activity motivated 17 ministers to resign.'' The most important change in the new Cabinet is the planning minister. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON>, an architect of the government's economic stabilization program, with <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, a prominent businessman who was running the Social Emergency Fund.

 Publishers of sex-oriented newspapers would be forced to post 24-hour guards at newsracks to prevent minors from buying the papers under a law given preliminary approval. But City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> said Tuesday he would recommend that city leaders rescind the ordinance because it conflicts with state law, which takes precedence. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> gave the ordinance initial approval by a 4-2 vote Monday. <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> said he had done further study since making a statement earlier Tuesday that he believed the law would stand up to constitutional scrutiny. `` I do n't see the ordinance as opening a Pandora's box or undermining the First Amendment,'' he had said. `` We're just responding to the community's concerns about keeping adult material away from children, that's all.'' The ordinance, believed by <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> to be the first of its kind, allows coin-operated machines with adult publications only if publishers hire guards to make sure minors are n't among the customers. A final Council vote is scheduled Oct. 3. If approved, the ordinance would become law in 30 days, barring appeals. The Constitution protects publishers from laws that ban their written material, but courts have sided with cities that restricted the availability of pornography to people under age 18, <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> said. Sex-oriented newspapers published locally are sold in newsracks throughout the city alongside those for conventional daily newspapers. No representatives of adult publications attended the Council meeting, but the measure has drawn criticism from publishers who would be affected by it. `` There's absolutely no way we can man all the newsracks,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Berk </PERSON>, editor for the Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> would n't comment on the financial feasibility. `` But the concern we were asked to address was how to protect minors, how to prevent them from buying adult material, and that's what this ordinance does,'' he said Police Chief <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> spoke in favor of the measure, which would allow officers to seize coin-operated newsracks that are not monitored by adults 24 hours a day. Councilmen <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Maudsley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> voted against the proposal, saying they believe the money required to defend it in court could be better spent. `` My concern is I think it is a First Amendment issue,'' <PERSON> Maudsley </PERSON> said. `` We're going to spend an awful lot of money going to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckett </PERSON>, who heads a group supporting the measure, was among those who presented a petition signed by about 700 residents. `` This ordinance has nothing to do with the First Amendment,'' she said. `` If adults want to purchase these publications that's fine But we have a responsibility to keep our children from being exposed to this type of material. `` I'm not objecting to the newsracks being on the sidewalks, but I am against them being so readily available to curious minors. This stuff can be harmful to them.''

<TEXT>
 Ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> received at least $ 47.7 million in kickbacks from Japanese firms between 1966 and 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Tuesday. It said the figure was contained in a 1987 report by the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Good Government, established to retrieve the estimated $ 10 billion the government says <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> embezzled before his February 1986 ouster. According to the newspaper, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> received commissions on projects which Japanese firms undertook as part of an agreement to help rebuild the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> as reparation for damage during Japanese occupation in World War II. These included irrigation, flood control, and construction of highways and bridges. `` It may be inferred that contracts were not necessarily awarded to the lowest bidder but to the Japanese trader or supplier who was willing to give a commission to Filipino officials, particularly then <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>,'' the newspaper quoted the report as saying. The newspaper said at least $ 17 million of the total $ 47.7 million was deposited in secret Swiss bank accounts. Allegations that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> received kickbacks from Japanese firms are not new and have been aired frequently here since the former president fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in February 1986 after his ouster in a civilian-military uprising. The allegation was based on affidavits filed by former Public Works Minister <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, no relation to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is to give a deposition in November about irregularities in the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has petitioned the anti-graft court to allow him to return to cross-examine the former minister. The government has asked the court to reject <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' request. A decision is pending, and the government is expected to appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> if the petition is granted.

 A 12-year-old boy who blew up an Iraqi tank by stringing grenades around his body and flinging himself under it will be shown on a new Iranian 1,000 riyal banknote, the official <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> news agency said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahmideh </PERSON> died during the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> siege of <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Khuzistan </LOCATION> province in the early years of the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. The report, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said that Iranian patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> once referred to <LOCATION> Fahmideh </LOCATION> and part of the quote will appear on the note: `` Our leader is that 12-year-old child who ...'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s picture will be on the other side of the note, said <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>. The note, worth a little over $ 14 at the official exchange rate, will start circulating Sept. 22, it said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> started the gulf war on that day in 1980.

No estimates are available on how many children were part of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s armed forces. But the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and humanitarian groups said the children were often used on the frontlines to clear minefields, following <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s instructions that `` martyrs'' who died in the war would be rewarded with paradise. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has previously denied that children were an established part of its war effort.

 A federal appeals court ruling barring a Christian-operated manufacturing plant from requiring employees to attend prayer services will spark new rounds of court action, a lawyer said Tuesday. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> ruled Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Townley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Eloy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, must allow employees to skip the services if they want to. <PERSON> Townley </PERSON> is expected to appeal the decision, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, an anti-discrimination lawyer with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> will seek to have the ruling applied to <PERSON> Townley </PERSON>'s other plants nationwide, she added. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> is already seeking contempt sanctions against <PERSON> Townley </PERSON> over continued services at the plant and is appealing a lower court decision upholding the termination of an employee who objected to the services. Monday's 2-1 ruling requires the Florida-based company to offer non-participation to employees whose religious convictions conflict with the service. The ruling does not, however, ban the services outright as the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> had sought. The plant, about 55 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, makes mining equipment. Owners <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Townley </PERSON> say the business, like the rest of their lives, reflects their born-again Christian faith; they enclose biblical tracts in all mail, put biblical verses on business documents, and require employees to attend `` non-denominational'' services during work hours once a week. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelvas </PERSON>, a machinist hired in 1979, attended the services for two months but then objected because he was an atheist. <PERSON> Pelvas </PERSON> left the company four months later, and lost a damage lawsuit in which he contended he effectively had been fired. But the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> lodged a complaint against the company charging religious discrimination. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> ruled in favor of the agency in May 1987, barring mandatory services at the plant. The appeals court allowed services to resume while it considered the case, but ruled Monday that objectors must be allowed the option of staying away. `` Where the practices of employer and employee conflict ... it is not inappropriate to require the employer, who structures the workplace to a substantial degree, to travel the extra mile in adjusting its free exercise -LRB- of religion -RRB- rights, if any, to accommodate the employee's ... rights,'' said the opinion by Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneed </PERSON>. The lone dissenter, Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Townley </PERSON> had done enough by allowing the employee to wear ear plugs and read a newspaper while attending the services. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Townley </PERSON> was not available for comment Tuesday, and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Townley </PERSON>, who answered the telephone at the couple's home, said, `` I'm not interested in talking about that today.'' <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Townley </PERSON> has said in depositions that he intends to follow `` God's law'' and continue with the services even if his actions conflict with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, and <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said she did not expect him to back down. The <PERSON> Townley </PERSON>'s lawyer said he would consult them about a possible appeal.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Deny Permit For Opposition March</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Nicaragua-Contras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government refused to issue a permit Tuesday that would allow an opposition coalition to hold a protest march, saying the rally could lead to violence. The Democratic Coordinate's last rally, on July 10, ended in a bloody clash between police and protesters. Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said the permit for Sunday's planned march was denied because the protest was intended `` to create disturbances. The opposition coalition protested the decision. `` Political groups should have access to the means of communcation, take part in the right of association and the ability to hold public manifestations,'' <PERSON> Duilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltodano </PERSON>, a Democratic Coordinate leader, was quoted as saying by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> late Tuesday. The opposition coalition is made up of opposition political parties and organizations. Forty opposition figures were arrested during the previous rally and face criminal charges. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> acknowledged during a news conference Tuesday that the denial of the march permit left the government open to criticism. But he added: `` It would be worse and would be a larger political cost and a greater pretext for our enemy and more of an argument for aid to the Contras -LRB- the U.S.-supported rebels -RRB- if there were provocations here that led to bloodshed in the streets of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> admitted in congressional testimony that it used undercover agents in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to stir up public protest, hoping the leftist government would overreact. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said he did not know if the July 10 demonstration in <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, was the result of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> provocations. Scores of people suffered injuries in the Nandaime rally. Witnesses saw police beat, kick and shove demonstrators with rifle butts. Officials were injured by rocks hurled by the protesters. The Sandinistas later claimed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy backed the march and charged the embassy was seeking a plan to undermine the government. The following day, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, was expelled from the country. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> was suspended for 15 days and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station was temporarily shut down. Government officials recently have charged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seeks to justify a reason to approve renewed military aid for the rebels, who have been fighting to oust the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> since 1981.

<HEAD>Government Outlines Laws To Seize Terrorist Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government outlined sweeping legislation Tuesday to prevent funds reaching terrorists, including new police powers and a change in bank secrecy laws. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> unveiled the proposals at a police conference in this northwest resort town. The measures will come before Parliament next year. Police welcomed them, but civil libertarians expressed some concern. `` The time has come for firm action to throttle the flow of cash to terrorist organizations,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. He said the laws include outlawing handling funds for terrorists, freezing or confiscating these funds and freeing banks from secrecy rules so they can inform police of suspect deposits. `` We shall draw the definition of ` terrorist purposes' wide enough to catch anyone connected with this trade of death,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. Police `` will be able to seek warrants to get at relevant material, including bank records of transactions,'' he said. The laws would bar handling assets that are `` to be used for terrorist purposes, even if that activity is going on in an otherwise legitimate business,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. A court convicting a person could `` confiscate any property or money that he has handled and that is intended for use in terrorist acts or in connection with terrorism,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said, adding the court would assume the money was tainted `` unless someone with an interest in it could show otherwise.'' Anticipating criticism, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said while democracies `` need to consider long and hard'' before adopting such measures, `` our conclusion is that the police and the courts must no longer lack the necessary powers to find and cut off the fuel which sustains the engines of murder.'' The proposals were seen mainly as a weapon against the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting to rid <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> of British rule and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the 95-percent Catholic Irish Republic. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION>, objected to making the defendant prove funds were not destined for terrorist activity, saying: `` In many cases this could prove an impossible task.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a senior <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> police official, welcomed the proposals. `` If we can stop the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s money at source we can help prevent them buying arms and explosives,'' he said. `` No organization can last without funds.'' Protestant Rev. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the measures were `` too little, too late.'' He said the restrictions could be dodged by funneling the money to the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> claims one source for the estimated $ 8.5 million reaching <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> coffers annually is <LOCATION> Noraid </LOCATION>, a pro-IRA fund-raising group in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> did not spell out whether the new laws would affect <LOCATION> Noraid </LOCATION> contributions, but said bilateral agreements would be sought with foreign governments to help seize suspect funds.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Soldiers mutinied and civilian workers in three state-run companies went on strike Tuesday in what appeared to be a popular uprising against the vestiges of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s ousted regime. Radio stations said the revolt spread after the newly installed government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> failed to expel army commanders who had been left in place. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, who declared himself president Sunday after <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was deposed in a military coup, appointed a new armed forces chief Tuesday and appealed for an end to the unrest. The government also announced Tuesday night that eight generals were retired. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said the government was taking steps to satisfy `` the most urgent demands of the members of the armed forces.'' But reports of reprisal killings, demonstrations and military mutinies grew. `` I'm afraid we're on the eve of another insurrection,'' a government official said privately. Soldiers around the country mutinied Monday and Tuesday and removed their commanders, many of whom had served under the three preceding governments of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>. `` We will chase out of the army all supporters of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>,'' a policeman at a station in downtown <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, where soldiers removed their commander, said on independent Radio Inter. The army runs the police in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, civilian workers at the state electricity company, port authority and flour mill went on strike to force the removal of their state-appointed managers, radio stations said. Workers looted and tore apart by hand the house of <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Souriac </PERSON>, head of the electricity company while two armed soldiers stood by, witnesses said. The flour mill manager also was removed, radio stations said, but the port authority manager still held his job late Tuesday. The fate of the three managers was not known. Radio stations said gunmen killed four people in apparent reprisal for the Sept. 11 massacre of 13 people during a Mass at a Roman Catholic church and other atrocities linked to <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s government Ten other people have been reported killed since <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> seized power. The coup was led by non-commissioned officers and lower-ranking soldiers in <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s own presidential guard. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was exiled to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which shares the island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. In apparent attempt to quell the uprising, the government issued a communique on state television Tuesday night announcing that it had retired eight generals and promoted four other officers. The government said among those retired were Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Regala </PERSON>, who had been ousted as interior and defense minister after the coup and has not been seen since, and Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON>, former army chief of staff. Earlier, radio stations reported that mutinying soldiers had ousted the commanders of the navy, Col. <PERSON> Hebert </PERSON> <PERSON> Valmont </PERSON>; port and airport security, Col. <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Romelus </PERSON>; the crack 300-man Leopards Batallion, Col. <PERSON> Abelard </PERSON> <PERSON> Denis </PERSON>; and Col. <PERSON> Gambetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Hypollite </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Artibonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, a region north of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. The Confederation of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, a leftist coalition, called for demonstrations Wednesday in support of the non-commissioned officers outside the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where the Sept. 11 massacre took place. Soldiers who staged the coup had demanded of the military command that <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> be put in power, that the military be reorganized, and that democratic reforms be brought to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, including free elections, sources said. During the ceremony outside the National Palace Tuesday, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said he was aware of `` numerous problems'' within the armed forces, but urged his troops `` to stay calm, not to adopt attitudes which may expose the institution to wanton criticisms and affect the spirit of unity and solidarity which the new government is seeking.'' The president, shown on state-run television wearing a dress uniform, spoke from the palace steps to a gathering of about 200 soldiers representing all units of the 7,000-man Haitian army. At the ceremony, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> announced the appointment of a new armed forces commander-in-chief, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Herard </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, who was foreign minister under <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>'s appointment confirmed speculation that Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, commander of the dreaded 700-man <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> military unit, would not assume command of the army. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeking <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s extradition to face federal drug charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> led a junta that ran <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> for most of the 2 -LCB- years since <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> was forced into exile in February 1986. There was no announcement of an army reorganization during <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s address. The announcement had been expected Monday, but a goverment official said the high command was hesitating to make it, fearing a loss of its authority. It was unclear if that spurred the unrest among soldiers late Monday and Tuesday. After a night of gunfire and violence in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, non-commissioned officers and troops of the 4th Company in downtown <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> on Tuesday arrested their commander, Maj. <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON> <PERSON> Symbert </PERSON>, and deposited him unharmed outside the downtown army headquarters, radio stations said. They said gunfire was heard at the army compound in <LOCATION> Mirebalais </LOCATION>, about 25 miles northwest of the capital, as soldiers mutinied against their commander, Lt. <PERSON> Simeon </PERSON> <PERSON> Francois </PERSON>. The lieutenant fled. Radio stations said soldiers revolted at the <ORGANIZATION> Toussaint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louverture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gonaives </LOCATION>, 100 miles north of the capital, on Tuesday, chasing out their captain and demanding the ouster of the military commander. It was reported that thousands of people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Gonaives </LOCATION> in support of the mutiny. Soldiers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> also mutinied Tuesday, expelling the warden, Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, whom they accused of misconduct. On Monday, troops of the <ORGANIZATION> Leopards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> handcuffed their leader, <PERSON> Denis </PERSON>, to the entrance of army headquarters. Firing automatic weapons triumphantly into the air, they sped in vehicles back to their compound, near the wealthy suburb of <LOCATION> Petionville </LOCATION>. Soldiers of the 160-man <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> also briefly detained their commander Monday before expelling him from their base in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> said unidentified gunmen on Tuesday killed police Detective <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> and three other men. <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> was widely reputed to have been a member of <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s dreaded <LOCATION> Tonton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macoutes </LOCATION> secret police force, which terrorized the population during the 29-year <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> told the nation Monday he had appointed 11 civilians and one army officer to the Cabinet `` for the definitive installation of democracy.'' He made no mention of plans for free elections.

 Tropical Storm <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> formed in the eastern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> on Tuesday and showed potential for strengthening into a hurricane in the next day or two, the National Hurricane Center reported. <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> is the eighth named storm of the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season and the first since Hurricane Gilbert formed in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and went on to ravage <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Helene </PERSON>'s winds, based on satellite photos, reached 60 mph Tuesday and was moving west at about 15 mph, according an advisory from the hurricane center. Meteorologist <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lascody </PERSON> said a storm path can not be projected until it moves closer to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. `` It's going across the warmest water of the year now, which is perfect to fuel its growth,'' <PERSON> Lascody </PERSON> said Tuesday night. `` But it really would be very premature to give a guess on what may happen. It still has a long way to go.'' Storms that form this month near the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s coast are often the season's strongest because of ideal hurricane-spawning conditions, forecasters say. Factors such as low-pressure zones in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and high-level winds will affect the path of the storm, said <PERSON> Lascody </PERSON>. `` It looks like it will reach its make-or-break point sometime later this week,'' he said. The depression that became <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> had initially seemed disorganized, but satellite photos showed circulation had improved. The hurricane center has not yet received ship reports on the storm's intensity. At 10:30 p.m. EDT, <PERSON> Helene </PERSON>'s center was located 1,500 miles east of the <LOCATION> Lesser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION> at latitude 12 north, longitude 37.8 west. It will take about four days for <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> to get close enough to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to allow an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reconnaissance plane to overfly the storm. Until then, hurricane forecasters will have to rely on satellite reports, said forecaster <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. He emphasized there was no way to tell if <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> would become as powerful as the deadly <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which forecasters have called the storm of the century. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which had winds about 175 mph at its peak, did not reach tropical storm strength until reaching the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>.

 For all the grand designs of the presidential nominees, a large number of Americans believe neither candidate could deliver on most of his campaign promises, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found.

 An improving trade deficit helped economic growth remain strong in the second quarter despite the Farm Belt drought, but inflation was more severe than previously believed, the government said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the broadest measure of the nation's $ 4 trillion economy, grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.0 percent in the April-June period. That was slower than the 3.4 percent expansion rate in the first quarter, but still brisk. If not for the drought, second-quarter growth would have been a more robust 3.9 percent. Crop and livestock losses for the year are estimated at $ 13.9 billion and will be even more of a drag on the economy in the third and fourth quarters.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON> does not behave like a TV star. He would consider that a high compliment. On a recent visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to participate begrudgingly in a minimal amount of publicity for his show, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Wiseguy,'' he plopped down in a hotel dining room chair in long hair, baseball cap and faded denim jacket. The disguise helps him avoid the public attention that makes him uncomfortable. <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON> avoids the glitter of show business like the plague. When not working on the series, which is filmed in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, he lives in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with his wife and kids. And he does n't hang out with other actors. `` I'm just an actor when the camera's on,'' he said. `` The rest of the time I'm just <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>, and I just do what I do. I like it that way.'' <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, had aspired to be a professional baseball player, but an injury ended that dream. When he was 19 and going nowhere, he decided he had nothing to lose by driving out to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to try acting. It looked like a better job than stacking auto parts. `` When I'd come home from work, you know, I'd watch television like every other average guy, go to the movies occasionally, and I just was n't intimidated by it,'' he said. `` It just did n't seem like it was that big of a deal, that it should n't be all that difficult. `` I figured, well, I ca n't play baseball, I did n't have an opportunity to go to college or anything, so I thought I'd give it a shot, I had nothin' to lose, and I got lucky.'' That's the kind of luck that other actors spend lifetimes wiping bars and waiting tables for. `` That's why I do n't hang out with them,'' <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON> said. `` There's a lot of sour grapes ... I do n't need the aggravation. I say, ` What am I supposed to do, not do it because you waited tables for 15 years?' I did n't tell you to do that. That's why I set the time limit, because I did n't want to be one of those people who would wait tables for 10 or 15 years waiting for the big break to happen, because a lot of them are real bitter, and I just do n't want to live life that way.'' <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON> gave himself 18 months to make it, or go back to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and pick a trade school. But he quickly landed his first starring role, in the movie `` The Wanderers.'' He later had a supporting role in the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> movie `` Fort Apache, The <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>,'' starred opposite <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> in `` Jinxed,'' then opposite <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> in `` Purple Hearts.'' In the critically praised `` Wiseguy,'' <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Vinnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Terranova </PERSON>, an agent of the <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> who goes so deep undercover he is sometimes tempted to go over the line. The show languished in the ratings its first season but picked up viewers in summer reruns and will be back this season. <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON> says even if the series became a big hit, he would prefer to walk away in about three years rather than dragging it on as long as anybody will watch. He'd like to go back to movies, because _ ever the pragmatist _ they're less work. And do n't look to see him on a stage anytime soon. He's never been on one and says he's only seen three or four plays in his whole life. `` I've gotten in trouble with this before, so I have to explain,'' he said. `` Just because I'm pragmatic about this occupation does n't mean that I do n't take it seriously. I mean, I do to the extent that I try to do the best job that I can. ... I just keep it on an occupational level. I do n't take it to another level of being all artistic and everything. `` If somebody else wants to think it's artistic, well, that's fine But to me, it's my job. I'm supposed to do it well. If I do n't do it well, I wo n't be able to continue to work. And then you get hungry. And that's my point.''

 When <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Falacy </PERSON> saw open flames near the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> in fire-ravaged <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> recently, he stopped his truck, ran into the blackened woods with a shovel and attacked the hot spots. `` I'm from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and I wo n't let it burn anymore,'' said <PERSON> Falacy </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION> and lives in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, N.M. He should n't have done it, because he had no firefighting gear or protective clothing and because snags are dangerous, but his wife, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, said she could n't stop him. `` He's really upset,'' she said. The Falacys were in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> to check out the damage from the worst forest fires in centuries. Nearly half the park's 2.2 million acres have been charred by wildfires this summer. `` It was about what I expected, but <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> just could n't take it when he saw the flames,'' <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Falacy </PERSON> said. `` He saw flames and went right down there. You could n't stop him.'' <PERSON> Falacy </PERSON>'s typified the reactions of people from the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> neighborhood _ the states of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. `` I did n't realize how much damage there is until we saw it for ourselves,'' said <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. `` It was bad enough reading about it. This is so awful I ca n't describe it.'' Living near the nation's oldest national park generates a proprietary interest in its welfare, and there is much anger over the events of the summer. However, tourists from distant parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and overseas are less emotional about the damage and say they expected to see far worse. `` When it all grows back it will be twice as pretty,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Quiggle </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quiggle </PERSON> said television coverage of the fires had led him to believe that `` all I'd see was burned trees They made it sound like the whole park was scorched to the ground.'' Forest fires burn in a scattered pattern called a mosaic by foresters. Acres of blackened trees are interspersed with untouched stands. Other sections are burned at ground level, but foliage is untouched. Many of the park's most popular attractions have escaped the fires. No damage is visible at the falls near <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, Artist Point and the north shore of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. Old Faithful, however, is partially surrounded by scorched trees. A tour group from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> marveled at the parts of the park that remain _ at least so far _ undamaged. `` We thought it might be worse,'' said <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellerington </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cokedale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. `` But it's a beautiful place. `` We've been able to see the falls and Old Faithful and what we wanted to see, and we're so glad we could see <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> at all,'' she said. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said they, too, expected more damage. Gazing out over the spectacular canyon and the falls of the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said she hated to see the burned trees visible from some roads, but was n't disappointed with the park. `` The main reason to come to the park is the things like Old Faithful, the canyon, animals and geysers, and all these things are here,'' she said. `` There's a lot left.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On a host of issues, from Star Wars and student aid to child care and the Nicaraguan Contras, Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offer voters clear distinctions on where and how they would lead the country as the next president. But in many areas, including how they propose to reduce the huge federal budget deficit or provide long-term health care for the elderly, each candidate has been purposely vague _ especially about the cost of their good intentions. As they prepare for a head-on collision on the issues in their first nationally televised debate Sunday night in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, here is a look at the major stands of the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAXES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s response to the question of tax increases consists of three words: `` No, no, no.'' He has vowed, `` I wo n't raise your taxes, period.'' He proposes to lower the 28 percent capital gains tax to 15 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says that would cost the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> $ 30 billion or more, but the vice president contends it will generate more revenue than it loses. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has suggested expensive new tax credits for oil and gas exploration and child care. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says, `` No serious candidate for the presidency can rule out the possibility that we will need new taxes to get our budget deficit down and our economy back on track.'' His first target: a crackdown on tax evaders who he says cheat the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> out of $ 110 billion a year. If taxes prove necessary as a last resort, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says, `` I would see that they are raised on the basis of the ability to pay.'' He opposes a cut in the capital gains tax, calling it a tax break for the wealthy.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s solution to the annual $ 150 billion federal deficit is a so-called `` flexible freeze'' on all federal spending except Social Security. It would allow government programs, including defense, to grow no faster than inflation. Some would have to be cut to allow for spending increases that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised for education, child care and other initiatives, but he has not specified where the cuts would come. He favors a line-item veto and a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. `` The most important action we need to take on the budget deficit is to hold the line on taxing and spending,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promises to make `` tough choices'' on spending, but for the most part refuses to say where the ax would fall. He opposes a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, but favors line-item veto authority for the president. He has said he does not envision major cuts in domestic programs, and has hinted that any savings from cutting back on the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> and such weapons as the rail-based mobile MX missile and Midgetman missile would be offset by a buildup in conventional weapons. `` There are only four ways to reduce the budget deficit: cut spending, increase revenue, bring down interest rates and improve economic performance,'' he said. `` We must do all four.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFENSE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, `` I believe that the -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- administration's approach in rebuilding <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defenses is fundamentally correct. He has not suggested scrapping any <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> weapons systems, although he says the proposed single-warhead Midgetman missile would be costly. He promises to press ahead with research and eventual deployment of SDI, or Star Wars, the space-based missile defense system, although he cautions that a full deployment would be `` very expensive.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes the rail-based MX missile. He says the Midgetman is strategically sound, but very costly. He is against plans to build two more <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aircraft carrier task forces at a cost of $ 18 billion each. He has called Star Wars `` a fantasy'' and says he would reduce its research budget to $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says Republican mismanagement has left the military short of tanks, artillery and other conventional weapons. He supports the Stealth bomber, Trident II submarine-based missiles, the advanced tactical fighter, the SS-21 Sea Wolf fast-attack submarine and advanced cruise missiles, as well as more tanks and artillery.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CHILD CARE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who says he wants `` a kinder and gentler nation,'' has proposed a $ 2.2 billion federal income tax credit for low-income and middle-income families up to $ 20,000 a year to help pay child-care costs. The credit of up to $ 1,000 per child under age 4 would be refundable for parents who do n't earn enough to pay income taxes. All low-income families with at least one working parent would be eligible; the care could be provided by family, friends or in any type of day-care facility, including those run by churches and synagogues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has endorsed the concept, but has not committed himself to the cost, of a $ 2.5 billion, Democratic-sponsored bill that would funnel child-care aid to families earning up to 115 percent of median state income. The measure would establish and expand child-care facilities nationally, with a national advisory committee establishing minimimum health and safety standards for both day-care centers and homes. The bill has run into snags in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over restrictions on church-based day care.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ABORTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Both candidates say they personally are not in favor of abortion. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports a constitutional amendment that would ban abortion except to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports government financing of abortions only to save the mother's life. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes efforts to outlaw abortion, saying the matter should be left for women and their doctors to decide. He supports government financing of abortions for the poor.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, `` Continued research on the virus combined with public education and testing are the best path to curb the spread of AIDS.'' He has said, `` We may have to spend even more'' in the AIDS fight than the government's current budget of nearly $ 1 billion. He has urged states to routinely test marriage license applicants, patients at clinics treating sexually transmitted disease or drug abuse, and prison inmates. Records must be kept `` appropriately confidential.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says children should be taught `` essential facts about AIDS in a thoughful, sensitive manner,'' and children who carry the virus should be allowed to stay in public classrooms with proper safeguards. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promises to `` commit the resources necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, find a cure, develop a vaccine and care for people with AIDS and AIDS-related complex.'' He says he will lead a `` massive public education campaign'' and teach the public `` about both the facts and the myths of this terrible disease.'' He supports federal legislation to protect AIDS patients against discrimination and impose penalties `` for violating people's confidentiality. He supports mandatory testing in the military and of immigrants from countries with high incidence of AIDS, as well as in blood, sperm and organ donor banks.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, `` In the past few years, we have not done enough to protect the environment. I will do more.'' He promises to seek an end to ocean dumping of wastes by 1991, a goal of `` no net loss of wetlands'' and a moratorium on offshore oil drilling in sensitive areas such as the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. He also says he will seek to curb acid rain by finding ways to cut `` millions of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000 and to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions,'' and to accelerate the Superfund cleanup of toxic wastes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he will set and enforce strict standards for air and water quality and strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to `` make the polluters pay.'' He says he will work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` to stop the acid rain pollution of North American skies and waters.'' He promises to `` halt below-cost timber sales in national forests'' and he opposes offshore drilling in environmentally sensitive areas, including the <ORGANIZATION> Georges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DRUGS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calls drugs `` a cancer on our society'' and says he will make his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, czar of an administration-wide assault on drugs. `` We have had some good results in stopping this poison at the borders. But drug abuse must be attacked not only by stopping the supply, but also by stopping the demand,'' says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We have to educate our children about the dangers of drugs.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he will wage `` a real war, not a phony war, against drugs.'' He promises to appoint a federal czar to oversee the nation's drug enforcement, rehabilitation and education efforts. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vows to cut off foreign aid to governments that refuse to cooperate with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts, hire 600 more <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents and strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and dispatch the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military `` under appropriate circumstances'' to help foreign governments eradicate drug crops and drug processing labs. He promises to expand aid for drug treatment clinics to make space available for any addict who wants to kick the habit.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ENERGY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former oilman, has proposed a 10 percent tax credit for oil and gas exploration. He wants to fully decontrol natural gas prices, use more coal as an energy source and fill up the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> faster. He says nuclear power `` must be a part of our energy mix.'' He opposes an oil import fee. He says, `` There is no way to meet our energy requirements without offshore drilling,'' but some sensitive tracts should not be leased. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes the construction of new commercial nuclear reactors until new reactors are designed and safe ways are found to treat and dispose of radioactive wastes. He also would fill the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. He says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must become less dependent on imported oil. `` We must use cleaner fuels, like natural gas, and better technologies, like clean coal. And we must promote alternatives to fossil fuels and significantly increase energy efficiency and conservation,'' he says. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, too, opposes an oil import fee.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Each candidate says he wants to be `` the education president.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised to spend more on Head Start, the preschool program for needy children, and to increase the education budget by $ 600 million, including a new `` Merit Schools'' program that would reward schools that make strides in educating the disadvantaged. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has proposed allowing parents to earn interest tax-free on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he favors creating a $ 250 million National Teaching Excellence Fund to attract people to teaching with scholarships, sabbaticals and other incentives. He says he is committed to the principle that no qualified student should be denied a college education because of financial need. He has proposed allowing students to borrow money for college and pay it back through a payroll withholding tax throughout their working lives. He promises to work in partnership with the private sector to eliminate adult illiteracy.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HEALTH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, `` We must mount a comprehensive effort to reduce the cost and improve the quality of, and access to, health care in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He says Medicare may be able to save money by extending its prospective payment system for hospitals to physician and outpatient services, but he is wary of `` regulatory schemes that could have the unintended effect of lowering the quality of health care.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favors tax incentives to encourage people to save for their own long-term costs in nursing homes. He says elderly couples should not have to bankrupt themselves before qualifying for government help. The centerpiece of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' health program is a promise to make basic health insurance available to all American workers, with their employers footing the bill. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> recently became the first state to impose such a requirement on all but the smallest employers. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> maintains this can be done at no cost to the federal government. Business groups contend it would cost employers heavily and result in job losses. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he also is committed to the goal of ensuring that all the elderly have access to long-term care. `` With a $ 150 billion federal budget deficit, we will not realize this goal overnight. But we must begin now, with commitment and compassion,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says.

<HEAD>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT</HEAD>

 More bad news about an oversupply of oil on world markets overshadowed a mixed performance in energy futures. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the October contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled 16 cents higher at $ 14.73 a barrel Monday after a late-afternoon rally in anticipation of the contract's expiration on Tuesday. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery gained 0.02 cent to close at 44.24 cents a gallon. The October wholesale heating oil contract lost 0.01 cent to settle at 41.36 cents a gallon. Analysts said the market opened lower, influenced by a report that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> intentionally was violating its production quota in a direct challenge to the 12 other nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a respected industry newsletter, said the quota violation was a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> strategy ahead of next week's meeting of the cartel's price monitoring committee to bring other quota violators back in line with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> pricing policy by competing with them for market share. The meeting is scheduled for Sept. 25 and 26, either in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> or on the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION>, according to reports. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s largest oil producer and once was considered the swing producer, and in a position to influence other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. But recently, some analysts have questioned <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s leadership role. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, for example, has refused to abide by an OPEC-imposed quota, saying it needs the oil revenue to rebuild its war-torn country.

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities fell in the government's latest auction. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 7.0 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.17 percent on Monday, down from 7.21 percent last week. Another $ 7.0 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.34 percent, down from 7.41 percent last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.05 percent on Aug. 15 and six-month bills averaged 7.26 on Aug. 8. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 7.40 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,818.80 and and 7.73 percent for six-month bills selling for $ 9,628.90. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the average yield for one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, fell to 8.01 percent last week after averaging 8.09 percent the week before.

 World finance officials begin arriving this week for the annual World Bank-International Monetary Fund meeting, which is expected to be more a forum for discussion of economic ailments than a producer of any historic policy decisions. Finance ministers, central bankers and other officials from 151 countries are expected to attend the joint meeting, the first ever held in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Representatives of the countries will present their nations' positions on various economic issues at a plenary session scheduled for Sept. 27-29 Preliminary talks that include a meeting of officials of the world's seven largest industrial democracies _ the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> _ begin Thursday. Coincidentally, Thursday is the three-year anniversary of the so-called Plaza Agreement in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> agreed to depress the dollar's foreign exchange value to help curb the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. Since then, the dollar has declined by nearly 45 percent against the Japanese yen, a move cited as a key factor in cutting the deficit over that time. Also during the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> discussions, the G-7 nations are slated to review their economic coordination policies. The Group of Seven comprises the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Observers say the Group of Seven likely will reaffirm its intention to keep the dollar steady at around current levels and restate its belief that an excessive rise or fall of the dollar would be counterproductive to world economies. <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> officials and private economists say the importance of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> meeting is not its results, but the new ideas it produces. `` I do n't think there will be any major decisions, but there should be a lively exchange of new ideas,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietsch </PERSON>, economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerzbank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, said in an interview. <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, told reporters last week: `` We expect no historical decisions.'' Also scheduled to meet this week on Thursday are deputy finance ministers of the Group of 24 developing countries. The plight of heavily indebted developing nations is expected to be a major topic during the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> talks. According to <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> annual report released Sept. 14, the industrial nations are in good financial health but the overall situation among developing countries remains far from satisfactory. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> report said total debt of the developing countries increased 10.4 percent in 1987 from the previous year to $ 1.2 trillion, while their average growth rage fell to 3.4 percent in 1987 from 4.2 percent in 1986. The Third World debt issue likely will be dramatized in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> by protests expected to be staged concurrently with the finance meetings. About 40,000 protesters have said they will come to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to denounce what they see as unfair treatment of the developing nations by richer industrialized lands and calling for general Third World debt relief, according to organizers. Industrialized nations and private banks have been encouraging developing countries to undertake economic reform in exchange for help with their debts. <PERSON> Pietsch </PERSON>, the West German economist, says that strategy continues to show the most promise. However, some indebted nations have called for more sweeping solutions to their problem, including partial or whole debt forgiveness. `` A general debt relief would not help to stabilize economies and societies,'' <PERSON> Pietsch </PERSON> said. `` We need to be flexible and look for new instruments -LRB- to help reduce developing countries' debts -RRB-. The debt countries are also creating lots of innovations in order to overcome their problems,'' he said. French Economics Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON> has indicated that during the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> discussions he plans to unveil a proposal aimed at encouraging banks to step up their lending to middle-income debtors. Other topics likely to be discussed during the meeting are the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade and budget deficits, protectionism and high inflation in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, represented by its newly appointed <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, is expected to stress that the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president would continue the nation's cooperation with the rest of the G-7 countries. There also could be discussion of a possible Soviet entry in the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s minister for economic cooperation, said last week he would be `` extremely happy'' with such a move, which he said likely would speed up structural economic reform within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 Its inventor says the Baby Bag was born of desperation. In years past, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> would have to grit her teeth and try stuffing her 4-month-old daughter <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> into a snowsuit while the child twisted, kicked and screamed until her veins bulged. Bundled and ready, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> needed a diaper change; once outdoors, her mittens fell off, creating another trauma. This was no way to enjoy winter, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> thought. Some type of bag-like outfit would be more convenient and more protective of the baby's face. So <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> stitched together a cozy little bunting sack to replace the traditional snowsuit, called it Baby Bag and began selling the insulated outfit in stores. It was an immediate success. `` It's a good product to sell because it's a very simple design, and the -LRB- promotional -RRB- pictures are always cute because the babies are cute,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said during a recent interview at her office in this <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> suburb. In 1980 _ a year after she began selling the bunting suits _ Andrews and husband <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> formed <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. They sold 681 bags that winter. The company now sells more than 30,000 bags a year and has recorded annual revenue over $ 500,000. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> also has expanded the company's facilities in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, expanded her product line, added a manufacturer in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and begun to set up marketing in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The bag _ which retails for $ 30 to $ 40 _ is displayed in several catalogs nationwide and sells in about 800 stores in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. It has been written up in Good Housekeeping and Parents magazines, and was displayed among several new consumer products on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' program. Using the bag is relatively easy. Parents can slide a child in and out of the bag without the pushing and pulling associated with tight-fitting snowsuits. The baby is warmed by its own body heat, which rises from the bottom of the bag. Loosening the strings at the top of the suit provides ventilation without having to undress a baby, as with traditional snowsuits. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 39, says the outfit was born of desperation. Just the sight of a snowsuit coming out of the closet sent her daughter into a 15-minute tantrum. `` I needed something to pop her in and get outside quickly because once she was outside she was fine,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' sewing experience was limited to repairing a few sails on the sloop she and her husband operated as a charter boat. Undaunted, she stitched a prototype one-piece suit that drew favorable comments from people who noticed the curious attire. She hired a Camden tent company to make the bags she distributed to friends, who encouraged her and her husband to open a business. They patented the bag and tried to persuade the outdoor outfitter L.L. Bean, based in nearby <ORGANIZATION> Freeport </ORGANIZATION>, to buy their idea and manufacture the product. But the company turned them down, saying <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> and her husband should develop the product themselves. With a few magazine advertisements, a $ 5,000 bank loan and 500 baby bags manufactured by a local sportswear company, the couple began a mail-order business at home in 1980. Telephone orders poured in day and night from around the country. Soon after, a product buyer at L.L. Bean helped <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> improve her idea, and the outfitter finally agreed to carry the bag in a December 1983 mail-order catalog. The backing from L.L Bean, coupled with a few magazine ads and displays at trade shows, pushed annual sales to $ 350,000 by the spring of 1984. While her business succeeded, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' marriage fell apart. She sold the mail-order division to another <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> company, Good Gear For Little People, but was frightened by the prospect of managing a wholesale business alone. `` I was a child of the 60's who never thought I would ever have to be serious about anything,'' she said. `` I had never been a person with a purpose or a goal.'' The warm and cheerful <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> says she adopted a slightly sharper edge following her divorce, quickly realizing that companies took her product more seriously once they saw she was assertive and persistent. Last year, she moved the business to <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION>, where she lives with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, now 10, and her second husband, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Krill </PERSON>. They renovated their barn into offices where <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, dressed in jeans and running shoes, scurries around with her three employees managing a line of products that now includes mittens, booties, snowcuffs for ankles, hooded jackets and pants. The products are made in <LOCATION> Fryeburg </LOCATION> by stitchers for a sportswear company who work part-time for <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>. They can produce about 7,000 Baby Bags a month and thousands of the other accessories. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> chuckles at her success, calling it `` a real story about how people who do n't know anything about anything can do something.''

<HEAD>NYSE Member Firms Report Drop in Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 41 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> member firms doing public business lost money during the second quarter, even though overall the firms' profit rose by 26.7 percent during the period. The exchange reported Monday that the investment companies had after-tax earnings of $ 365 million, compared with a profit of $ 288 million in the same period of 1987. The 226 profitable companies had aggregate pre-tax earnings of $ 813 million, while the 160 unprofitable firms lost an aggregate $ 261 million, the report said. Revenue of the 386 companies was down slightly, dropping to $ 12.449 billion from $ 12.603 billion a year ago. The firms had revenue of $ 13.015 billion in the first quarter. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, senior vice president at the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said inflation pressures and concerns about higher interest rates had a negative effect on the securities business. `` In addition to lower volume, there was a lowering of securities prices in both the fixed income and equity markets,'' <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said. `` And that's very important, because what determines commissions and trading profits are security prices.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> said the after-tax profit in the second quarter represented a 4.0 percent annual return on member firms' average net worth of $ 36.66 billion. Commission revenue amounted to 17.9 percent of total revenues in the second quarter, down from 18.6 percent in the first quarter, the report said. Member firms' assets rose 5.7 percent to $ 456.4 billion from $ 431.6 billion in the first quarter. Capital, which includes ownership equity and subordinated liabilities, rose 2.1 percent from the previous quarter to a record $ 37.04 billion. First quarter capital was $ 36.275 billion. The exchange said its specialist firms, which make markets for the stocks traded on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> floor, saw their aggregate after-tax profit drop to $ 30 million in the second quarter. That was down 36 percent from $ 47 million in the same period last year and off 55 percent from $ 55 million in the first quarter. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> said the specialists had a 12.3 percent after-tax return on capital in the quarter, compared with 17.7 percent in the same period last year and 22.3 percent in the first quarter.

<BYLINE>Bank Group President: Taxpayers, Not Banks, Should Bail Out
Thrifts</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Taxpayers _ not a bank-financed insurance fund _ should pay for the multi-billion dollar bailout of insolvent savings and loans, according to the president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> bankers Monday there was no alternative but to use taxpayer money because of the large and rapidly growing problem of insolvencies of thrifts and the deterioration of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that insures deposits in S & amp; L's. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should `` accept the facts of life'' that the problem requires taxpayer support. <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON> was equally adamant in opposing the use of funds from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures bank deposits, to help foot the bill. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> was n't created to bail out insolvent thrifts,'' he told the bankers. While deregulation has blurred many of the former distinctions between commercial banks and thrifts, each institution has its own regulatory and insurance systems. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> insures an individual's deposits of up to $ 100,000 at commercial banks and the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> provides similar insurance at thrifts. The insurance funds are supported by premiums paid by the insured financial institutions. <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON>, who also is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> NorthPark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said an <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> committee would recommend today not only that tax funds be used to deal with the growing problem, but that the government step in to halt the growth of the insolvencies and to increase the pace of liquidating insolvent thrifts. <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON> said the report to be released today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would blame the growth in thrift insolvencies on inadequate regulation and supervision. The deterioration of the thrift industry and the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> will be the single most dominant financial issue for bankers in 1989, <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON> said. He estimated the bailout would cost $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion, considerably more than predicted by the federal government's <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> estimated last week that the cost of merging, closing or disposing of insolvent thrifts would be in the range of $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion. He said that while banks and thrifts were separate entities, `` this is a bank problem,'' and the cost of coping with it is rising by $ 1 billion a month. `` Bankers across the country are concerned there could be a Saturday night massacre'' in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would merge the $ 18 billion <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> fund with the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, he said in an interview before his speech. `` We are worried there could be confiscation of a fund built up by us.'' Bankers also are worried, <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON> told reporters, because the practice of allowing insolvent thrifts to continue operating was cutting into profits. `` So-called brain-dead thrifts are paying excessive interest rates'' to attract depositors, forcing banks to compete and driving up the cost of raising money, he said. `` Our banks feel the pressure when insolvent thrifts build up credit costs,'' he told the convention. Over the long term, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should bring thrift regulations up to the same standards that exist for banks and should permit bank holding companies to acquire and operate thrifts.

<HEAD>CSX Restructuring To Return to Railroad Roots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to sell some of its major holdings and repurchase up to 38 percent of its outstanding stock is designed to return the company to its railroad roots, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> officials say. `` The restructuring program evidences our continued commitment to increasing stockholder value by concentrating our resources on our core transportation businesses,'' said <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, chairman of the Richmond-based transportation holding company. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> believed the firm's common stock was an attractive investment, but said `` the repurchase plan will permit stockholders who desire to sell their stock an opportunity to do so at a premium over the current market price.'' <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, will repurchase up to 60 million shares of common stock beginning this week. Each CSX shareholder will be invited to tender shares at prices specified by the shareholder, ranging from $ 28 to $ 33 per share. The company will select a single purchase price and will pay that price for up to 40 million shares tendered at or below that level. The stock repurchase will be funded with cash and short-term borrowings, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> also will sell its natural gas transmission and natural gas liquid processing businesses, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transmission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NGL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The company said also it might consider selling some of its resort properties, including the <LOCATION> Greenbrier </LOCATION> hotel in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> announcement triggered positive investor reaction. Its stock closed Monday at $ 30.62 -LCB- per share, up $ 3.75 on a volume of almost 3.5 million shares in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> responded to the announcement by placing certain <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> securities on its CreditWatch with negative implications, a possible prelude to lowering the company's credit rating. S & amp; P said even though <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> had cash and short-term investments of $ 1.1 billion at mid-year, the company would need to borrow money to finance its announced intention to trim 8,200 jobs from its railroad payrolls. <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to unload the pipeline and possibly certain resort properties marked a major move away from the diversification strategy that <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> has embraced in recent years, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> reserch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` I think what it shows is almost a restlessness at the senior management and board level with the price of their stock,'' he said. `` They obviously consider it very much undervalued.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest grocery chain, has reaffirmed its plans for a major restructuring after receiving an unsolicited $ 4.32 billion takeover bid from the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> received the $ 55-per-share bid for each of its 78.6 million outstanding shares on Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Haft </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The offer was revealed in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s board by <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> Chairman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON>. In his letter, which was made public by <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> was offering shareholders $ 43 cash per share and securities with a trading value of about $ 12 per share. `` All terms, including price, are negotiable and we are confident that together wer can determine and appropriate, proportionate ownership of the combined companies by <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders and <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders,'' <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> said The news of the offer pushed up <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s shares Monday. In active trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.75 a share to close at $ 52.75. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, operates more than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 convenience stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states. The company also processes a variety of food products for sale in its retail stores and to outside customers. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, owns the Crown Books bookstore chain and the auto parts retailer <ORGANIZATION> Trak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said its board was considering a $ 3.8 billion restructuring that would involve a special dividend of $ 40 a share in addition to a junior subordinated debenture with a trading value of about $ 8 per share. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said that while <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>'s offer was being reviewed, the company has not dropped its plans for the restructuring, which is scheduled to be taken up by the board at the end of September. The company declined further comment. The Kroger bid was the first takeover offer <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> has made since its failed bid for <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. The <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family has expressed interest in <LOCATION> F.W </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Zayre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> this year, but has not bid for either retailer. <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> and his son <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> have earned reputations as corporate raiders because they have bought up big stakes in retailers, made unsuccessful takeover bids and then profited from the sale of their stock when the companies bought back the shares or went private in buyouts by other firms. Their targets in the past have included <ORGANIZATION> Supermarkets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ both of which are supermarket companies _ and <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The Hafts maintain they are interested in buying and operating a retail company. In early August, the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> filed for federal approval to acquire a substantial stake in <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy contracted during the second quarter due mainly to lower demand for exports and declining investment in private housing, the government reported Tuesday. Overall economic growth, as measured by the gross national product, declined at an annual rate of 3.9 percent during the April to June period, the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. On an adjusted basis, the GNP fell by 1 percent, the agency said. During the first quarter, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s GNP grew 2.7 percent, or at an annual rate of 11.3 percent, according to the government report. The decline in the total value of goods and services produced in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> during the period was the first quarter-on-quarter contraction in the country's economy since the January to March 1986 period, when the economy briefly declined under the impact of the sharply rising yen. The government's GNP growth rate target for the current fiscal year is 3.8 percent. Agency officials said a 1.5 percent decline in foreign demand for Japanese products and services and a downturn in private housing investment over the previous quarter's levels more than offset a modest growth in domestic personal consumption and private capital investment. The greatest declines were in the yen value of exports of televisions, video tape recorders, radios and motor vehicles, they said. The Japanese yen has risen by about 83 percent against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar in the past three years, making Japanese products more expensive overseas. But despite the downturn from healthy GNP growth levels in previous months, agency officials said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy remained fundamentally strong. `` It's still showing a positive progression overall,'' said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` There's no reason to think that Japanese economic expansion has ended,'' said <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, senior economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fall in housing investments is a little steeper than expected, but on the whole we thought the numbers would be in this range.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had predicted earlier that the second quarter's GNP would remain unchanged or decline slightly from the previous quarter after statistics showed housing starts in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were peaking. Housing construction had boomed because of low interest rates and huge government expenditures in public works, which indirectly stimulated construction and other industries.

 A federal appeals court ruling indefinitely blocking the partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers is the most encouraging sign yet for halting the deal, the main opposition group said. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>' ruling Monday prevents the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and The Detroit News from proceeding with a joint operating agreement until the court rules on the challenge brought by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Citizens </LOCATION> for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The court also set an Oct. 28 hearing on the challenge to the merger and agreed to expedite the case. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state senator who leads the organization comprised of advertisers and readers opposed to the merger, said he was extremely encouraged by the ruling. `` We jumped all the procedural hoops,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said Monday. `` We finally got to a forum that is willing to look at the merits of the case.'' To qualify for the indefinite halt of the merger, opponents had to prove they have a `` substantial likelihood of success'' on the merits of their claim. In granting the order, the court said opponents of the merger `` have presented a serious legal question.'' <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> publisher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> characterized the court order as `` simply another development in a very long, now almost 30-month-old process.'' `` What pleases me ... is the quite expedited schedule,'' he said. `` That means everyone will get an earlier answer.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, which has lost $ 100 million since 1980, is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> bought the News in 1986, before the dailies asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to approve the joint operating agreement <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Weil </PERSON>, publisher of the News, referred questions about the appellate court ruling to <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, who could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> executive in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, was unavailable for comment. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s group disagrees with former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who ruled that the newspapers qualify for an antitrust exemption under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970. They argue that the exemption, which would create the largest joint operating agreement in the country, is unwarranted because the two dailies are losing money only because they have engaged in a 9-year-old price-cutting war to put each other out of business. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> are the nation's two largest newspaper publishing companies. The two papers have a combined weekday circulation of 1.2 million. The merger of the two dailies' advertising, circulation and production departments would create one of the nation's largest local newspaper publishing companies, and would result in the loss of between 600 and 800 jobs. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>, which has threatened to close the Free Press if the joint operating agreement is not approved, argues that the newspaper is powerless to reverse losses by raising prices.

<HEAD>OPEC President Said Price Committee May Not Call For Full Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s price committee may not call for an emergency meeting of the full cartel when it meets later this month, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Asia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> here, <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production may be higher than recent estimates. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said the five-member committee scheduled to meet Sept. 25 and 26 at an as yet undisclosed location, has a number of items on its agenda besides the current oversupply of oil that has depressed world prices. `` Present -LRB- oil market -RRB- conditions are serious, but whether they warrent an emergency meeting is for the committee to decide,'' <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said. `` ... It's by no means the only problem we have on hand.'' While the price committee can not determine policy or set production limits, it has the authority to call a meeting of the full cartel, which can. World oil prices have declined in recent weeks on fears that several <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries were continuing to overproduce, adding to the already excessive supply of oil. Last week, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil prices dipped to near a two-year low then rebounded slightly on reports that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was reducing its output. However, <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> estimated <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production is between 19 million and 19.5 million barrels a day, higher than recent estimates of between 18.5 million and 19 million barrels. The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> president cautioned it was difficult to assess current cartel output. `` I think some people are very brave or very smart to make an estimate,'' he said. On Monday, an industry newsletter said that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s largest producer, was intentionally exceeding it production quota to challenge other members to reduce their output <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cooperation with non-OPEC oil producers would be another topic for discussion at next week's meeting, along with the Iran-Iraq cease - fire He said collaboration with non-OPEC producers is `` perhaps the only way we can get better -LRB- crude oil -RRB- prices.'' `` The fact of the matter is there's some form of overproduction, and it's not just <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> alone,'' <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is looking for specific cuts in non-OPEC production `` as a guide to what -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- will be able to do ourselves to help in pushing prices up.'' The cessation of hostilities between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would help <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> planning, he said, but added that he does n't expect <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to return to its OPEC-assigned quota of 1.5 million barrels a day. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is said to be producing approximately 2.7 million barrels of oil a day and the country's oil minister said recently that it may have to increase its output to gain the necessary revenue to rebuild its war-torn economy. `` If they want to do 2.7 million, suppose <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> says they wo n't go below 10 million -LRB- barrels per day -RRB- as a counter to what <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said?'' <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> asked, quickly stressing his example was hypothetical. Earlier, he denied he had information that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> was overproducing.

<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This city approved a tentative $ 6.5 million settlement in the massive <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Public Power Supply System lawsuit, leaving 18 defendants on trial over a record $ 2.25 billion bond default. `` I feel fantastic, very relieved,'' Councilman <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bray </PERSON> said after the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved the settlement Monday as the federal trial continued in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. Plaintiffs in the case, including more than 24,000 bond buyers, sued over <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>' 1983 bond default, which came after it abandoned two nuclear power plants under construction. The default was the biggest ever in the municipal bond market. Under the settlement, which is subject to approval by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richland </PERSON> will pay <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> bondholders $ 6.5 million, of which $ 3.725 million will be paid by <ORGANIZATION> Twin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The remaining $ 2.775 million comes from 1982 bonds Richland sold to cover WPPSS plant termination costs and some capital improvements, said City Manager <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON>. The bond issue was factored into past city electric rate hikes, <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> said. The city also agreed to testify on bondholders' behalf. <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, which has more than 30,000 residents, had a 1.965 percent interest in the scrapped nuclear plant projects. The settlement leaves 15 public utilities, two engineering firms and a financial company as defendants in the trial, which was moved to <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> because of pretrial publicity. Seven other utilities settled with the plaintiffs before the trial began earlier this month. Defendants argued in opening statements Monday that a 1983 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling was to blame for the default. The high court invalidated agreements that 88 utilities signed to participate in building the nuclear plants financed by the bonds. `` The cause of the loss here is almost like an act of God, an act of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Klickitat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit by some utilities questioning the agreements' validity. By nullifying them, the court removed the guarantee that the bonds would be paid even if the plants were never built. Although the ruling applied to them, none of the utilities was part of that lawsuit. In opening arguments last week, bondholders' attorneys said the defendants lied about power needs in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, rising costs and construction delays. They contended that if the truth had been told, the bond would not have gone on the market. Defense attorneys argued Monday that their clients revealed all the information they were supposed to provide and did their best to estimate costs and construction schedules. `` The evidence will show that these official statements were as complete and accurate as people could make them, and they were not filled with misstatements,'' said attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagan </PERSON>, representing financial consultant <ORGANIZATION> Blyth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON> said public utility commissioners and <PERSON> Blyth </PERSON> employees were so confident in the information that they also bought bonds Testimony is scheduled to begin Thursday after a two-day recess. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> was formed by public utilities to build and operate major electric plants in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Growing White Wheat In a Field of Red</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The prospect of naturally sweeter bread and new export markets is sparking fresh interest in the cultivation of hard white winter wheat in the Plains states. While the hard red variety has been king of the Plains for more than a century, a number of growers in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> are now giving white a try. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which sprang from a group organized in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, the nation's No. 1 wheat-producing state, says millers may pay premium prices for white wheat because it yields more flour per bushel. White also has bread baking qualities comparable to hard red, long the world's premium bread wheat. Because of its lighter kernel color _ amber rather than the red _ more of the white wheat kernel can be ground and the flour is lighter in color than that of red wheat, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Keesling </PERSON>, president of the producers' group. The white wheat flour also has a slightly sweeter taste because the kernels lack the tannins that give red wheat bran a bitter taste, <PERSON> Keesling </PERSON> said. Thus, bakers can save money by cutting down on sweetners normally used to offset the slight bitterness of red wheat flour. `` My wife bakes with whole wheat flour from white wheat sometimes and people think the things taste sweeter, even though the sugar in the recipe actually is reduced,'' said <PERSON> Keesling </PERSON>, a Chase, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, farmer. Hard red wheat has been the favorite among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> growers because it had the advantage of catching on first, after <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> immigrants introduced it to the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. As a result, little hard white wheat is now grown in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Some is raised in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and researchers in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are experimenting with hard white varieties. Most of the white wheat cultivated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is of the soft variety, grown primarily in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and used in cookie and biscuit products. The movement to hard white is small but organized. The new producers' group is incorporated as a marketing cooperative, which controls the sale of the members' white wheat, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tice </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>. The white wheat will be treated as a specialty crop and separated from hard red for marketing and storage. To avoid mixing it with other varieties on the open market, the white wheat will be sold on a contract basis by the cooperative. <PERSON> Keesling </PERSON> expects <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> growers to plant more than 2,000 acres of hard white wheat this fall, mostly in the western part of the state, where growing conditions are best. Moister conditions in the east have caused the hard white wheat to exhibit `` head sprouting'' _ in which the kernels in the heads of the plants begin to sprout, destroying the value of the grain for milling purposes. <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> wheat breeders are working on a new variety with resistance to sprouting, but it is several years down the road. One <ORGANIZATION> KSU </ORGANIZATION> variety being tested this year may be released in 1989, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> KSU </ORGANIZATION> wheat breeder stationed at the Fort Hays Experiment Station. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> KSU </ORGANIZATION> associate agriculture dean and director of agriculture experiment stations, said increased grower interest has given a dramatic boost to white wheat research begun in the late 1950s. `` Within the past 18 months or so the administration has given us the green light to go ahead and increase our efforts because of the extraction rate and possible marketing niches -LRB- for white wheat -RRB-'' <PERSON> Feltner </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> KTECH </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a state economic development agency, gave the university a $ 160,000 grant that was matched with $ 160,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to work on white wheat and other wheat projects. <PERSON> Feltner </PERSON> said grain scientists are studying white wheat quality and end uses and agricultural economists are studying its market potential. One of the areas being evaluated is white wheat's export promise. Many of the world's importing countries prefer white wheat, said <ORGANIZATION> KSU </ORGANIZATION> breeder <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` Hopefully, this would open up some new avenues in some traditionally Australian white wheat markets,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. Australian white has been a favorite in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters would likely target some of those strongholds. `` I think we're probably a couple of years away from knowing whether white wheat is going to have an exciting start in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> or whether it's going to be a gradual transition,'' said <PERSON> Feltner </PERSON>.

 With something as simple as a greeting card, <PERSON> Truesillia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> hopes to help bridge the gap between the separate worlds of the sighted and the blind. `` It seems so unfair that a blind person should miss out on the simple, little pleasures of life,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON>, sitting in the living room of her modest home that doubles as the office for her 7-month-old card company, Sucurre Greetings. Sucurre means `` to assist'' in French. `` Can you imagine being 30, 40 or 50 years old and having to wait for someone to read a stack of Christmas cards to you? Or not being able to go into a store and pick out an anniversary card for your wife or a birthday card for your child?'' she asked. The inspiration for Sucurre Greetings, which Mrs. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> owns with her husband, came while she was working on an advertising project with a blind businessman. `` He was doing things I could n't do even with my sight,'' she said. `` It just did n't seem right that he needed someone to go to a store with him just to pick out a card.'' Because of the limited market, Braille greeting cards have not been manufactured by established card companies, said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ash </PERSON>, publisher of the Gift Reporter, a trade publication for the gift industry. Some rehabilitation agencies have been known to sell some Braille cards at Christmas, and others translate greeting cards to Braille when requested. `` At best, what you've been able to get up until now is a card for a sighted person that's been Brailled. These cards are designed specifically for a visually impaired person, but are still appealing to a sighted person as well,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponchillia </PERSON>, a professor in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ponchillia </PERSON>, who is blind, helped the Shanks design the cards. The Shanks, also co-owners of a year-old advertising and printing company, hope the pastel colors and simple but elegant designs embossed on the front of the cards will appeal to a wide audience. Underneath the design is a description of the object in <LOCATION> Braille </LOCATION>. Inside, Braille appears under the message, typically a short phrase with slightly raised letters. One lavender card has an embossed bird in flight on the cover. Inside, the message is `` My heart's all a-flutter.'' In addition to her basic line of 25 cards, Mrs. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> said she also has a line of Christmas cards for the holidays. `` We want the person to get the full impact of the card _ a card that everyone can enjoy,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON>, a bubbly, 32-year-old mother of three. She does the embossing by hand. Her husband, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, art director at an area television station, does much of the designing and printing. Most of the Brailling is done by blind volunteers. Distribution of the cards is mostly limited to local card shops, but Mrs. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> says she fills mail orders and is trying to line up distributors for the cards in other parts of the country. The cards sell for $ 2 and $ 2.50 locally. If the cards catch on, the <PERSON> Shanks </PERSON> would like to provide jobs for blind rehabilitation and training groups. And it looks like the cards may be catching on. Marshall Fields has expressed interest in buying the line for their chain of department stores, as well as an alphabet book Mrs. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> designed for use by both sighted and blind children. `` Before getting involved in this, I never really knew a blind person and I do n't think I ever remember seeing a book that's shown me what <PERSON> Braille </PERSON>'s like,'' she said. `` We planned the book to get rid of the gap between sighted and blind children. We want a sighted child to know what Braille feels like and a blind child to be able to feel the letters that we're seeing. Maybe that way we can get rid of some of the prejudice.'' Prejudice is a subject Mrs. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> knows well. `` Because I'm black, some people might ask why I'm not doing something for a black cause. Well, blindness knows no color. When people stop being prejudiced against blind people or handicapped people, maybe they'll stop being prejudiced about black people,'' she said.

 Leave it to show business veteran <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON> to team the forces of Olympic silver medal figure skater <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Harlem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globetrotters </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s superstar on ice wo n't suit up with the magicians of basketball, but she is performing under the same flag: <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON>'s company purchased the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Calif.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globetrotters </ORGANIZATION> and Ice Capades for $ 30 million in December 1986 from <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> Signing <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> to the Ice Capade's fall tour is one of many moves the former public defender, banker and motion picture executive has made to revitalize the skating troupe. He also has added a second squad to the <ORGANIZATION> Globetrotters </ORGANIZATION> and hired female players <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> to draw more women to the games. What's more, <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON> recently acquired the <LOCATION> Boblo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> amusement park near <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> for $ 19.5 million. He says the 272-acre island in the lower <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> will generate cash flow during the summer months when the <ORGANIZATION> Globetrotters </ORGANIZATION> and Ice Capades are idle. `` What we are is a mini-Walt Disney,'' said the 62-year-old Scallen. `` We want to expand within the concept of quality family entertainment.'' Besides the Ice Capades, <ORGANIZATION> Globetrotters </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Boblo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON>'s company owns a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> production company that made the movie `` Shoot to Kill,'' starring <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Berenger </PERSON>. A second film, `` South of <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>,'' is in the works and will feature <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON> also has his eyes on more regional amusement parks and some television stations. It was <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON>'s sale of Big Country TV of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, for an after-tax profit of $ 4.9 million that allowed him to purchase the Ice Capades and <ORGANIZATION> Globetrotters </ORGANIZATION>. `` Let's say <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON> -LRB- chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> are my role models,'' <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON> said. So far, <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON> has transformed <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> from an obscure penny stock company, which lost $ 1.2 million on sales of $ 2 million in 1986, to a $ 34 million company that expects to post net earnings this year of more than $ 2 million. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> stock now trades in the range of $ 10 a share on the national over-the-counter market. The business seems to fit <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON>'s colorful past. There was the law degree from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> that allowed him to work in that city as a public defender before returning to his hometown of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, where he acquired his love of skating. He said he returned to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to join a law firm in which his father was a partner. From there he turned to a banking career, starting the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> and helping to finance <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON>'s purchase of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dolphins </ORGANIZATION> professional football team. But he quit that to launch his show business career that eventually had him running Shipsteads & amp; Johnson Ice Follies, Holiday on Ice, and the <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty-Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Bros </PERSON>. Circus. He also worked briefly in a top executive post at 20th Century Fox. His darting moves through the entertainment world were briefly derailed in the early 1980s when <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON> ran afoul of Canadian securities laws. He was convicted _ but later pardoned _ for distributing a false prospectus on a loan he arranged to help finance his acquisition of the <ORGANIZATION> Vancouver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canucks </ORGANIZATION> hockey team. In typical style, <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON> emerged from the episode relatively unscathed. He was paroled after serving nine months of a two-year prison sentence and was pardoned in 1982 by the solicitor general of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Later, he even sold the <ORGANIZATION> Canucks </ORGANIZATION> for a profit, he says. `` There's no way of telling how painful an experience like that -LRB- prison term -RRB- was,'' <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON> said after receiving the pardon. `` Particularly when I believed then as I do now that I did n't do anything wrong.'' As <ORGANIZATION> IBC </ORGANIZATION> has grown from two employees in 1982 to 2,000 employees this year, the demands on Scallen have increased. But he says he loves it and he has refused to dilute his control over the company. `` This company is my life and it's a delight,'' <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON> said from his top-floor office in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>' signature skyscraper, the IDS Center. Splitting time between <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and an office in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON> operates the company with a skeletal administration that includes no middle managers. He says he wo n't make an acquisition `` unless it's a business I can run myself,'' and he still spends time at the ice rink staging Ice Capades shows. `` That's how I get my kicks,'' <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON> said. `` Those shows are the last big spectaculars in this country.'' <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Follese </PERSON>, who follows <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Summit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said her only concern about the company is that <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON> tries to do everything. `` When I started with this stock it was a dime,'' <PERSON> Follese </PERSON> said. `` I just thought <PERSON> Scallen </PERSON> was going to do it and sure enough he did. He's performed some real nice miracles lately.''

 The stock market posted a tiny gain today, but the pace of trading was sluggish. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 17.07 points on Monday, was up 1.78 points to 2,082.86 as of noontime. Advancing issues held a slim lead over declines on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 633 up, 610 down and 529 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 70.58 million shares at noon on Wall Street, compared with 69.80 million shares at the same point on Monday. `` It's been pretty dull,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, a technical market analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` People are waiting for something more conclusive to stir them off the sidelines,'' he said. The government's downward revision of its estimate of second-quarter economic growth failed to provide any stimulus to traders. <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> noted that the report had virtually no impact on bond prices, which often rally on indications of moderating economic growth. At midday, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> notes and bond prices were trading close to Monday's late levels. With bond yields still relatively attractive, <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said many traders have found incentive to take the risks associated with the uncertain returns on stocks. Among the blue chip issues, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> was up -LRB- at 26 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 45 and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> fell -LCB- to 28 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> led the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> list of most most actively-traded issues, slipping \ to 52 -LCB-. The company said on Monday that the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family had proposed at a takeover at $ 55 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -RCB- to 34. The oil-service company announced late Monday that would repurchase 30 million shares of common stock. Time was down 8 -LCB- to 107 -RCB-. The company said after the close of trading on Monday that it is n't considering a leveraged buyout or any other transaction. The company issued the statement after its stock price had risen $ 19 a share over the past two sessions.

<HEAD>Terrorizing the American Family</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the most popular games played today is terrorizing the American household. It's great fun, and profitable, too. Among those at the forefront of the movement are the media, the government, the business community, the fraternity of seers in such fields as economics, finance and science, and the outright exploiters. Fear sells, you know. You can sell fear to anyone concerned about physical or economic well being, and if you do n't think so just take a look at the magazine rack or the book stall. The field is wide open; if fear does n't exist, you can create it. Some of the fears are legitimate perhaps, but since there is no end to them, it becomes impossible to sort them out. How can you worry about radon, the well water, the air you breath and the weather together? Are you sure your children are n't overdosing on vitamins? Are they consuming too many fats, too much salt? What's your cholesterol level? When did you last check your blood pressure? You say you have n't had a physical? You were warned about the hurricane danger and still you have n't taken precautions Do n't you know the season continues into October? Tornados, you know, can occur at any time of year. Are you the kind of person who has n't yet begun preparing for the greenhouse effect? You say that the latter has n't even been demonstrated? That's pride and arrogance talking, especially if you live on the seacoast Just what will you do if the ice caps melt, raises the ocean level and swallows up your city? More to the moment, winter is coming. Are you sure your pipes are insulated? Had your flu shots? Remember that little leak in the roof last winter? It could become a big one in January. How are your finances? Do you mean to say that in these perilous times, when nobody knows what awful thing will happen next, you have no financial plan? No will? When was the last time you checked your health insurance? Are you prepared for the coming recession? Have you made plans to benefit from the coming boom if that comes before the coming recession? And what if deflation comes instead? You have to be ready for that possibility, too. Your economic preparedness kit should include procedures for handling the coming real estate collapse, the stock market collapse, the bank collapse. Have you really considered the dangers of that variable rate mortgage of yours? No matter what the politicians say, incidentally, you should worry about higher taxes. But you should worry, too, if they are n't raised, because then the federal budget will remain in deficit, and that is bad Hold on, says economist <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruff </PERSON>. He says you should add the shrinking federal defict to your fear list. `` It is to be feared in the same way that a junkie fears the cutoff of his supply,'' he warns. `` The withdrawal symptoms could be severe. A deficit stimulates an economy. When it shrinks, the junkies get sick.'' <PERSON> Ruff </PERSON>'s fear list includes deflation, higher interest rates, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' election, inflation-hedge investments, the stock market and the collapse of the American family, `` my greatest concern.'' There are so many things to fear that, for diversion, some securities seers have strung together lists of things not to fear, such as missing out on a bull market in stocks or failing to prepare for a strong economy. Having exploited fear a decade ago with the book `` The Coming Real Estate Crash,'' which either did n't occur or somehow was n't observed by millions of Americans, the same author has now written `` Panic-Proof Investing. `` A fearsome situation is developing,'' said a worrier the other day. `` What are we ever going to do about all these used and unused fears that are piling up and polluting the environment?'' He said it was really something to worry about.

 Stock prices finished higher in calm trading Tuesday, supported by news of slower-than-expected growth in British bank lending during August. Although prices on Wall Street were retreating by the close of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> session, British equities stood their ground and barely budged from their session peaks. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 12.2 points, or 0.7 percent, higher at 1,772.1, just below its best level for the day of 1,772.8. Volume remained light, with 309.2 million shares changing hands, compared with 326.7 million shares traded Monday. The British bank lending figures helped ease concern that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s interest rates might have to move higher over the short term in response to nagging inflationary pressures. The report showed that the most widely watched indication of domestic bank lending rose 5.8 billion pounds, the equivalent of $ 9.7 billion, in August, less than July's 9.2 billion-pound rise, and less than the 7 billion-pound to 10 billion-pound rise expected by the market.

<HEAD>Estimate of 2nd Quarter Growth Scaled Back, but Still Strong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, fueled by an export-driven manufacturing boom but held back by losses from the drought, expanded at a strong 3.0 percent in the April-June quarter, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, grew to a seasonally adjusted annual level of $ 3.99 trillion in the second quarter, a $ 29.1 billion increase from the January-March quarter. It was an unexpected downward revision from a preliminary estimate a month ago of 3.3 percent growth last quarter. The economy had grown at a 3.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter. If not for the drought, second quarter growth would have been a more robust 3.9 percent. Crop losses for the year are estimated at $ 13.9 billion and will be even more of a drag on the economy in the third and fourth quarters. The government attributed the downward revision in the second quarter to slightly less growth than first thought in the two strongest sectors in the economy: export sales and investment spending by business. Exports of goods and services expanded at a 9.1 percent annual rate, compared with the previous estimate of 11.6 percent. Business investment spending shot up 15.0 percent, compared with last month's estimate of 16.3 percent. However, consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds of all economic activity, was up 3.0 percent at an annual rate, compared with a slightly weaker 2.7 percent previously announced. The linchpins of growth during the first half of this year have been a boom in manufacturing triggered by the export surge and the consequent spending spree by manufacturers to modernize and expand their factories. But the strong growth has been accompanied by faster inflation. The government said a price measure tied to the GNP rose at the fastest rate in nearly six years. The GNP deflator, which reflects changes in buying patterns as well as prices, rose at an annual rate of 5.5 percent in the second quarter, compared with 1.7 percent in the first quarter. It was the biggest jump since the third quarter of 1982. Nevertheless, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` The facts, plus the moderating growth rate, point to inflation remaining under control.'' He said the report was `` good news.'' In another report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that after-tax profits by corporations surged 8.9 percent in the second quarter to an annual rate of $ 162.7 billion, up from a 2.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter. It was the most profitable quarter since the July-September period of 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, concerned about statistics showing a tightening labor market and factories straining toward the limits of their capacity, began an inflation-fighting program in late March by pushing up short-term interest rates. As reports on third quarter economic activity emerge, some economists are seeing signs of the desired slowdown. Among them: _ Civilian unemployment, at a 14-year low in June of 5.3 percent, rose in July and again in August, to 5.6 percent More people looking for work means less upward pressure on wages. _ Retail sales, a good barometer of consumer demand, fell 0.2 percent in August after a lackluster 0.1 percent rise in July _ Industrial operating rates edged up another notch in August, from 83.6 percent to 83.7 percent, but the increase was caused by a temporary surge at utilities Rates in the closely watched manufacturing sector edged down, from 83.9 percent ot 83.8 percent. For all of 1988, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is predicting real growth of 3.5 percent, which, if realized, would be the strongest since 1984. However, some economists such as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a private forecaster in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, see the annual growth rate easing to less than 3 percent in the quarter ending this month. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said growth rates in both exports and investment spending will be unable to maintain their recent torrid pace. Meanwhile, he says consumer spending will be hit sooner by <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s tightening of the money supply than in the past because more people have adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans tied to interest rate fluctuations. `` Rates have not gone up that much, but consumers are being cautious. They're just not taking on the debt to pay for those big-ticket items,'' he said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> predicted that overall economic growth will wind down enough to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates near the end of the year. But other analysts say the economy at the end of the second quarter had too much momentum for any appreciable slowdown to occur during the current quarter. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Annable </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, predicted third quarter growth of more than 3.5 percent, the fastest of the year. The sluggishness in the consumer sector, he said, is only part of an economy in transition from consumer-led growth to trade-led expansion. `` And we've got at least another year and probably two years of trade improvement coming,'' he said. Nevertheless, the slow numbers released so far for August will give <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy makers the excuse they want to take a break from pushing interest rates higher between now and the Nov. 8 election, he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> loves it. ... They're going to stand pat. ... They can not involve themselves in the election and that's exactly what they want to do. But after the election, if I'm right, that means interest rates will start to go up again,'' he said.

 Witnesses reported a 60th person was shot and killed as soldiers halted looting at a market in the city.

One opposition leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said street protests had been called off to avoid further bloodshed.

<HEAD>Securities Exec: Reasons To Support Farmer Mac Despite Unknowns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Unless the financial industry takes a real interest in a new form of farm lending, the opportunity may not arise again, an investment firm executive told a forum of Midwestern bankers Tuesday. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> said the newly created <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> Farmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, could help banks keep rural customers and reduce the risk of writing farm loans. Farmers, meantime, are hoping the agency will spur competition for farm loans and hold down interest rates. <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> said that despite high hopes for Farmer Mac, there are many unanswered questions about the agency designed to establish a secondary market for farm loans. One big unknown is how much of a demand exists for such new markets. If Farmer Mac does not sell well, `` I'm afraid it's an opportunity we may not get again,'' he told a seminar at the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> convention. Farmer Mac was established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enable rural lenders such as banks, insurance companies and the Farm Credit System to combine loans and use those pools of mortgages as security for investments sold to the public. It is still in the process of being organized and is months away from adopting even such basic regulations as how its loan pools will be organized. <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> is vice president for marketing for <ORGANIZATION> MABSCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines-based </LOCATION> company designed to provide banks access to secondary markets. <ORGANIZATION> MABSCO </ORGANIZATION> is owned by the insurance company <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and state banking associations in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and 11 other states. <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> said his company is interested in becoming one of the organizations pooling farm loans and selling mortgage-backed securities to investors. About $ 8 billion in new farm mortgage credit is extended every year, and only part of that will qualify for <ORGANIZATION> Farmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> securities, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. That will make Farmer Mac a small country cousin to such providers of secondary residential mortgages as <ORGANIZATION> Ginnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>. The outstanding principal balances of residential mortgages backing securities guaranteed by those three established agencies, formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, totaled more than $ 670 billion at the end of last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. What's more, farm loan demand has been in the doldrums in recent months. Following the farm crisis of the first half of the 1980s, in which farm debt rose to record levels, bringing down many banks, survivors began staging a recovery assisted by huge government subsidies. As a result, many surviving agricultural and rural banks are flush with cash. But <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> said credit could begin getting tight as early as 1989 making <ORGANIZATION> Farmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> a welcome tool for assuring liquidity and enabling lenders to shift the risk of long-term loans to investors. This summer's drought reduced crop yields, thinned livestock herds and held down many farmers' income at a time when the government is beginning to move to reduce its subsidies, and analysts are predicting loan demand from farmers will be growing as they expand plantings next spring. Not only are farmers expected to plant more next year, but the price of seed and fertilizer is rising and interest rates have been headed higher. `` If loan funds get tight, we can see demand develop quickly'' to harness <ORGANIZATION> Farmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> said. Analysts say yields on Farmer Mac securities should be competitive with <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> and other secondary markets for mortgages. The securities will be backed with a $ 1.5 billion line of credit at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury that can be tapped if losses in any mortgage pool exceed a 10 percent reserve fund established by lenders and pool operators.

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Lower; Gold Rises Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar drifted lower against most major foreign currencies in light European trading Tuesday, reflecting more reluctance by dealers to do business ahead of top-level finance minister meetings this week. Gold prices rose slightly in quiet trading. Markets ignored a downward revision in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product figures for the second quarter to 3.0 percent from 3.3 percent, foreign currency dealers said. They were more concerned with the potential impact of meetings starting Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF-World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> discussions on international debt will be followed by a Saturday gathering of finance ministers from the leading industrialized democracies. Both meetings will be held in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Ministers from the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> countries _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ are expected to push for stable currency exchange rates, dealers said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar edged up 0.35 Japanese yen to a closing 134.15 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it retreated to 133.90 yen. Many dealers said the worsening health of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> and a second-quarter decline of 1.0 percent in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s gross national product pushed the yen down. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6865 to buy one pound, more expensive than its $ 1.6785 level late Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Monday: 1.8641 West German marks, down from 1.8695; 1.5740 Swiss francs, down from 1.5793; 6.3385 French francs, down from 6.3520; 2.1075 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1100; 1,391.50 Italian lire, down from 1,393.50; 1.2203 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2194. Higher gold prices reflected internal market influences rather than renewed interest in the metal, said one <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> bullion dealer. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold edged up to $ 410 a troy ounce from late Monday's $ 409.30 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 410.50, up from $ 408.50 late Monday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> gold rose $ 1.72 to close at $ 413.12. Silver bullion prices rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 6.36 a troy ounce, from Monday's $ 6.28.

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday its first-quarter earnings rose 26 percent, in part because of a change in accounting for income taxes. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 71.4 million, or 83 cents per share, during the quarter ended Aug. 31, compared with $ 56.8 million, or 66 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. The company noted in a statement that its income was boosted $ 14 million as a result of the recalculation of prior years' deferred income taxes. Sales rose 2 percent to $ 1.48 billion from $ 1.46 billion. `` This represents the first step toward a better year in fiscal 1989, a year in which we expect to gain momentum toward much better long-term prospects,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, president and chief executive officer. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s food business has shown improvement, but the company is still spending heavily to boost its slumping restaurants division, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The restaurants unit reported a 34 percent decline in operating profit to $ 48.7 million from $ 73.5 million as sales declined 7 percent to $ 655 million. The unit includes Burger King, Steak and Ale and Godfather's Pizza. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> announced it was selling Godfather's to the chain's management for an undisclosed amount.

Talk that the Soviets had purchased 1 million to 2 million metric tons of both corn and wheat prompted buying in those markets, he said Rumors that government officials had scheduled an afternoon news conference regarding the ongoing grain-trade negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> added further fuel to the rally.

 The prospect of a bidding war over <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> loomed Tuesday as the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 4.6 billion for the supermarket operator, topping an offer from <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> made the day before. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> _ which earlier this year outbid <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> _ offered to pay $ 58.50 per share for each of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s 78.6 million outstanding shares, or a total of $ 4.6 The New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> it proposed to buy the retailer for a combination of cash, debt and equity in the company that would formed after a buyout. On Monday, the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family that controls <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> offered $ 55 per share, or a total of $ 4.32 billion, to buy <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>. A Dart spokesman, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, Md.-based company had no comment on the competing <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> offer. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock soared after the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> announcement, closing at $ 56.25 a share, up $ 3.50 from Monday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> reacted to the latest offer as it did to the <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> bid, saying it was reviewing the proposal but would continue to explore the possibility of a restructuring. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said it was considering a $ 3.8 billion restructuring that could make the company less attractive for a buyout. The Cincinnati-based retailer's board of directors was to review the proposal by the end of this month, the company said. In its letter Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> noted the restructuring proposal and the <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> offer, and said its own bid `` will better serve the interests of the company and its shareholders.'' The investment firm said it would pay $ 50 in cash, plus $ 8.50 in securities for each <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> share. Dart Chairman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> also told <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> in a letter made public Monday his company was offering shareholders a better deal than the restructuring plan. <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> offered $ 43 cash per share and securities with a trading value of about $ 12 per share. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said its restructuring would involve a special dividend of $ 40 a share in addition to a junior subordinated debenture with a trading value of about $ 8 per share.

<TEXT>
 A former programmer has been convicted of planting a computer `` virus'' in his employer's system that wiped out 168,000 records and was activated like a time bomb, doing its damage two days after he was fired. <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCown </PERSON> said he believes he is the first prosecutor in the country to have someone convicted for destroying computer records using a `` virus.'' `` We've had people stealing through computers, but not this type of case,'' <PERSON> McCown </PERSON> said. `` The basis for this offense is deletion.'' `` It's very rare that the people who spread the viruses are caught,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McAfee </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which helps educate the public about viruses and find ways to fight them. `` This is absolutely the first time'' for a conviction, <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> said. `` In the past, prosecutors have stayed away from this kind of case because they're too hard to prove,'' <PERSON> McCown </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` They have also been reluctant because the victim does n't want to let anyone know there has been a breach of security.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Burleson </PERSON>, 40, was convicted Monday of charges of harmful access to a computer, a third-degree felony that carries up to 10 years in prison and up to $ 5,000 in fines. A key to the case was the fact that State District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON> allowed the computer program that deleted the files to be introduced as evidence, <PERSON> McCown </PERSON> said. It would have been difficult to get a conviction otherwise, he said. The District Court jury deliberated six hours before bringing back the first conviction under the state's 3-year-old computer sabotage law. <PERSON> Burleson </PERSON> planted the virus in revenge for his firing from an insurance company, <PERSON> McCown </PERSON> said. Jurors were told during a technical and sometimes-complicated three-week trial that <PERSON> Burleson </PERSON> planted a rogue program in the computer system used to store records at <ORGANIZATION> USPA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Fort Worth-based insurance and brokerage firm. A virus is a computer program, often hidden in apparently normal computer software, that instructs the computer to change or destroy information at a given time or after a certain sequence of commands. The virus, <PERSON> McCown </PERSON> said, was activated Sept. 21, 1985, two days after <PERSON> Burleson </PERSON> was fired as a computer programmer, because of alleged personality conflicts with other employees. `` There were a series of programs built into the system as early as Labor Day -LRB- 1985 -RRB-,'' <PERSON> McCown </PERSON> said. `` Once he got fired, those programs went off.'' The virus was discovered two days later, after it had eliminated 168,000 payroll records, holding up company paychecks for more than a month. The virus could have caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to the system had it continued, <PERSON> McCown </PERSON> said. The defense argued during trial that <PERSON> Burleson </PERSON> was set up by someone using his terminal and code. <PERSON> Burleson </PERSON>'s attorneys tried to prove he was vacationing in another part of the state with his son on the dates in early September when the rogue programs were entered into the system. But prosecutors presented records showing that <PERSON> Burleson </PERSON> was at work and his son at school on those dates. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Beech </PERSON> maintained <PERSON> Burleson </PERSON> is innocent and but said his client might not have enough money to appeal. Besides, <PERSON> Beech </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Burleson </PERSON> is likely to get the minimum sentence of two years' probation. <PERSON> McCown </PERSON> said he is hoping for a stiffer sentence. <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON> on Tuesday ordered a presentence investigation and set sentencing Oct. 21. <PERSON> Burleson </PERSON> already has lost a civil case waged against him by <ORGANIZATION> USPA </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the incident. The jury in that case ordered him to pay $ 12,000 to his former employers. <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> said his organization had documented about 250,000 cases of sabotage by computer virus.

<HEAD>Dollar Little Changed; Gold Falls Toward $400</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 The dollar barely moved Tuesday in light foreign-exchange dealings, which money brokers attributed to upcoming meetings of senior finance ministers that might affect the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's value. Gold prices rose abroad but retreated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, falling toward the $ 400 - a-troy-ounce level in active trading <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 404.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 409.20 late Monday. Foreign-exchange strategists said a meeting Thursday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, followed Saturday by top-level finance officials from the leading industrial democracies, were deterring much dollar trading. The currency moved marginally throughout the day. `` We're into that range for the dollar again,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Yannalfo </PERSON>, a senior foreign-exchange trader at <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> commodities futures company. `` Unfortunately, we need something to rattle it.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar edged up 0.35 Japanese yen to 134.15 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it edged down to 133.90 yen. By the time trading ended in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fetched 134.09 yen, up slightly from 133.54 yen late Monday. The British pound strengthened mildly against the dollar in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 1.6865, up from $ 1.6785 late Monday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sterling fetched $ 1.6817, more expensive than $ 1.6787 late Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with levels late Monday, included: 1.8669 West German marks, down from 1.8677; 1.5767 Swiss francs, down from 1.5780; 1.2183 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2188; 6.3450 French francs, down from 6.3495; 1,389.00 Italian lire, down from 1,391.75. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday, included: 1.8641 West German marks, down from 1.8695; 1.5740 Swiss francs, down from 1.5793; 6.3385 French francs, down from 6.3520; 2.1075 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1100; 1,391.50 Italian lire, down from 1,393.50; 1.2203 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2194. Trading was much more active in the precious metals market, where gold prices continued to slide in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealings to the lowest levels since early last year, a reaction to growing investor disillusionment with bullion's value as a long-term investment and protection against inflation. `` We're going to test $ 400. It's not even a question anymore,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Posnick </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> MTB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> gold trading company. `` We've really been stuck in a rut for a long time and there's a lot of disinterest.''

<HEAD>Stocks Post Modest Gain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The stock market posted a modest gain in lethargic trading on Tuesday, recovering some of the ground lost in the previous session. `` It's been pretty dull,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, a technical market analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 17.07 points on Monday, bounced up 6.40 points to close at 2,087.48. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 862 issues up, 603 down and 500 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 142.22 million shares, up from 135.77 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 167.39 million shares. The Dow Jones industrials opened slightly higher, traded in a narrow range for most of the day and finished near the day's highs. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, head of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the gains reflected a technical rebound from Monday's selloff. `` People are nervous about yesterday's decline. There does n't seem to be any urgency to rush into stocks I do n't see the buying there as any more than a knee-jerk reaction to yesterday's decline,'' he said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, director of technical market analysis at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said the market appeared to be consolidating its gains of the past few weeks and expects prices to trend gradually higher. `` The market is not acting like it is ready to start a serious advance because we are not seeing cumulative buying by institutional investors,'' he said. Traders remain skeptical about the direction of the economy. The fear is that if the economy accelerates, inflation may rise as well and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will feel pressure to push interest rates higher. In its latest economic report, the government lowered its estimate of second-quarter economic growth from its estimate a month ago. <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said that while the downward revision indicated a more moderate pace expansion, he noted that positive development was offset by an upward revision in a measure of inflation tied to the GNP figures. As a result, <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said bond prices held in a narrow range for most of the day, providing little support to stock prices. With bond yields still relatively attractive, <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said many traders have found little incentive to take the risks associated with the uncertain returns on stocks. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> led the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> list of most most actively-traded issues, climbing 3 -LCB- to 56 \ The investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> proposed a buyout at $ 58.50 a share in cash and securities. The <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family had previously proposed a buyout at $ 55 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 ~ to 34 -LRB- The oil-service company announced late Monday that would repurchase 30 million shares of common stock. Among the blue chip issues, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> was up \ at 26 -LCB-, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 43 -LRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was up -LRB- at 45 -LRB- and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> fell -LCB- to 28 -LCB-. Time tumbled 10 \ to 106 after gaining 19 in the past two sessions The company said after the close of trading on Monday that it is n't considering a leveraged buyout or any other transaction. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market rose $ 8.983 billion, or 0.34 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed stocks rose 0.52 to 152.44. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 1.02 to 309.47, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.91 to 269.73.

<HEAD>Gold Prices Fall to 19-Month Low</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gold futures prices fell to a 19-month low Tuesday on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as gold producers sold futures to hedge against further declines in the cash market, analysts said. On other markets, coffee futures rallied strongly; pork futures led the livestock complex higher; grains and soybeans were mixed; energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. Gold for October delivery traded as low as $ 402.30 a troy ounce, the lowest price since Feb. 24, 1987, when gold futures last dipped below $ 400. Prices recovered a bit near the close when traders holding short -LRB- sell -RRB- took profits by buying at the low levels, analysts said. Gold producers were the among the heaviest sellers after the market registered little interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report on the gross national product, said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, metals analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> The report showed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy expanded at a rate of 3.0 percent in the April-June quarter compared with a rate of 3.4 percent in the previous quarter. The GNP number added to the already bearish sentiment in the inflation-sensitive gold market but another number in the report, the GNP deflator, rose at an inflationary annual rate of 5.5 percent compared with 1.7 percent in the first quarter. The deflator reflects changes in buying patterns as well as prices. Ms. <PERSON> Raptopolous </PERSON> said gold producers were watching the market's reaction to the deflator and sold when the market failed to rally <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, chief trader of precious metals for <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the sell-off reflected further bearishness in the market `` on the lack of any perception of inflation on the horizon. `` It could go through $ 400 and is going to get tested at that level,'' he said. Silver futures followed gold lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> while platinum futures fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled $ 3.90 to $ 4.70 lower with the contract for delivery in October at $ 406.20 a troy ounce; silver was 11.8 cents to 12.8 cents lower with September at $ 6.252 a troy ounce; platinum was $ 8.10 to $ 8.70 lower with October at $ 494.90 a troy ounce. Coffee futures surged on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid optimism about negotiations between consumer and producer nation-members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The ICO convened a two-week meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Monday to discuss changes in its price-support policies. `` There seems to be an aura of cooperation and the prospects for delegates completing their work by the first of October is very bright at this point,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, a coffee broker with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Coffee settled 1.25 cents to 3.21 cents higher with September at $ 1.23 a pound. Pork futures gained sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on a mixture of chart-based factors and position-evening ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Sept. 30 hogs and pigs report, a quarterly look at the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hog herd. Cattle futures gained on spillover buying from the pork market and bullish attitudes about the long-term outlook for the cattle-market, analysts said. Live cattle settled .27 cent to .70 cent higher with October at 69.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .52 cent higher with September at 80.37 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent to 1.25 cents higher with October at 38.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .95 cent to 1.17 cents higher with February at 50.70 cents a pound. Wheat and corn futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid rumors of new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but soybeans finished mixed on a lack of strong bullish signals. Wheat settled 5 -RCB- cents to 8 \ cents higher with September at $ 4.04 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents lower to 2 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.73 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents lower to 4 cents higher with September at $ 2.50 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent lower to 10 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 8.20 -LCB- a bushel Energy futures were mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents lower to 31 cents higher with October at $ 15.04 a barrel; heating oil was .09 cent lower to .14 cent higher with October at 41.32 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to .27 cent higher with October at 44.43 cents a gallon.

 <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it had sold its half-interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Elle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> joint ventures in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> to its lone partner, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but a source familiar with it and speaking on condition that he not be identified said the price was about $ 150 million. The sale is subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement. It was expected <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would use the proceeds of the sale to help finance its $ 3 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes TV Guide, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Form </ORGANIZATION> and Seventeen magazine. In a separate announcement, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON>, chairman of Triangle, said they had signed a merger agreement providing for the purchase of Triangle. The two men had announced in early August that they had agreed to the deal, subject to reaching a definitive agreement, among other things. The Triangle purchase remains subject to obtaining necessary government approvals and satisfaction of certain conditions in the merger agreement, the statement said. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has previously said he would sell some assets to help finance the purchase of Triangle, but had singled out only its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and some land in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. He has said his goal is to raise half of the needed funds through asset sales and borrow the rest.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will continue operating in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> until the Ecuadoran government takes complete control over the pipeline and oilfield operations the two now run jointly, a company spokesman announced Tuesday. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s new Center Left government, headed by President <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, announced Monday night it woudl assume control of the trans-Ecuadorian pipeline next year and take over oilfield operations in 1990 when its contract with the state <ORGANIZATION> Compania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecuatoriano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleo </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- CEPE -RRB- expires. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> manages 37.5 percent of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s petroleum industry. Oil accounts for about two-thirds of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s export revenue. `` The announcement surprised us, though we knew it would eventually happen,'' <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said at a <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION> press conference. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> told reporters the government failed to notify <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> about its plans and said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil giant would have preferred prior talks with the government. But he added: `` the government is exercising its rights according to existing contracts.'' Under its agreements with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, CEPE can take over the company's operations provided it notifies the firm of its plans a year in advance. A minor controversy arose Monday when a government spokesman termed the takeover a `` nationalization.'' The government later announced it simply was fulfilling the terms of its contract with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, and not nationalizing its assets.

 A former <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> bank president, convicted of federal racketeering and bribe-related charges for his part in the multi-million dollar fraud schemes of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Galanis </PERSON>, was sentenced to 20 years in prison Tuesday. `` I think you're dangerous,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brieant </PERSON> told <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> before sentencing him to 15 years for racketeering and an additional five years for crossing state lines to commit bribery. <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Southport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, could have been sentenced to a maximum 55 years in prison and $ 530,000 in fines. <PERSON> Brieant </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON>, who was defended by a court-appointed lawyer, had no capability to pay fines or make restitution. A federal court jury in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> had convicted <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Galanis </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and formerly of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, on July 5 of participating in a racketeering enterprise that looted banks, fleeced investors and defrauded the government of taxes. Prosecutors contended <PERSON> Galanis </PERSON> masterminded a phony oil - and gas-drilling tax shelter scheme that netted more than $ 172 million in fraudulent tax writeoffs for about 2,500 investors The so-called `` <PERSON> Galanis </PERSON> organization'' also left a <LOCATION> Rockland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, bank insolvent, fraudulently took over a <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> bank, forced <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> banking officials to take over another financial institution in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and stole $ 3.9 million from three <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> mutual funds. <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> was acquitted of involvement in the oil and gas shelter scheme but was convicted of helping bribe officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Monsey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> and defraud <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> bank officials. He was not charged in the other fraud schemes. Evidence at the three-month trial showed <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> paid $ 240,000 in bribes to <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and another $ 12,000 to its senior vice president to get the bank to buy more than $ 17 million in promissory notes from Galanis-controlled entities. On Sept. 13, 1985, the <LOCATION> Rockland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> bank was declared insolvent and taken over by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON>, who worked at banks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and was president of <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Trust in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, in the 1970s, also helped the <PERSON> Galanis </PERSON> organization take over the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> bank Through the racketeering conviction, the jury found <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> had helped make fraudulent misrepresentations to state and federal regulators to secure controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and to obtain a $ 4.5 million cash loan. In April 1987, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> had to take over <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION>. `` As of this minute, I still do n't feel that I've done anything illegal other than possibly to have much too narrow a focus and concentrate only on the banking aspects,'' <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> told the judge before his sentencing in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. As a former bank president, <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> `` was extremely valuable to the <PERSON> Galanis </PERSON> organization,'' said <PERSON> Brieant </PERSON>. The judge said <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> had `` no remorse and no understanding'' of why he was convicted. `` I think you're dangerous to yourself and to others because of what you did and your lack of understanding.'' <PERSON> Brieant </PERSON> is to sentence <PERSON> Galanis </PERSON>, who faces a maximum penalty of 207 years in prison and $ 8 million in fines, on Sept. 28 in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>.
