 A complaint by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> stopped the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> from banning the importation of 25 more models of semiautomatic weapons Thursday, a newspaper reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, in its Friday editions, said the bureau was ordered to hold off by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials after the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> raised objections. The newspaper said senior <ORGANIZATION> BATF </ORGANIZATION> officials decided at a meeting Thursday morning to announce the restrictions on the additional models later in the day, according to an official familiar with the events. But then they were instructed by the parent <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> not to proceed, according to the official. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> official, said the group learned on Wednesday night that other weapons might be added to the list of five types of assault weapons which drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> temporarily banned on Tuesday and contacted <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials who said there would not be any new restrictions, the newspaper said. The ban announced by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> included the Chinese-made AK47 and the Israeli <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON>, and covered about 80 percent of total imports of semiautomatic weapons. <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> then sought to close the door on the semiautomatic weapons not covered by the initial ban, fearing that these firearms would fill the void, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> BATF </ORGANIZATION> officials worried that manufacturers affected by the import ban would complain they were unfairly singled out.

<HEAD>Suicide Kills 140,000 Chinese A Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 140,000 Chinese take their own lives every year _ most of them women _ and suicide has become a particularly serious problem among rural women, a Chinese sociologist says. <PERSON> Shan </PERSON> <PERSON> Guangnai </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> said suicide is the leading cause of abnormal deaths in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and 70 percent of all victims are female, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported today. `` It used to be a taboo in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to study suicide. Yet in recent years we are increasingly haunted by the rising problem,'' the paper quoted her as saying. A survey of 10 million people taken by the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preventive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> found the suicide rate for urban women to be 10.2 per 100,000, and for urban men 7.23 per 100,000. In rural areas, the suicide rate was 23.34 for women and 18.6 for men. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the suicide rate is about 12 per 100,000. <PERSON> Shan </PERSON> said half the suicides among women are caused by family disputes and marital problems. He noted factors such as the breakup of the traditional extended family and lengthy separations as rural people stream into cities looking for work. Rural women are still treated as dependents and men dominate in the family, <PERSON> Shan </PERSON> said, adding that the psychological and emotional needs of women are largely ignored. He said women also appear to have more difficulty adapting to rapid changes in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s social values and moral standards brought about by industrialization and improving living standards. Rural women who migrate to the cities looking for work often find `` the sharp contrast is too much for them,'' <PERSON> Shan </PERSON> said. Those who return to their villages have difficulty adjusting again to rural poverty. Tens of thousands of Chinese committed suicide as a result of persecution during the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. The more recent phenomenon of suicide, linked to changing social conditions, has only recently begun to be a subject for study. In January 1988 the southern city of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> opened the nation's first suicide prevention and treatment center In the first year it received about 140 phone calls, 600 letters and dozens of visitors asking for help, the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> also opened a suicide prevention center last September.

 The leftist coalition that is to run <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has agreed on a new administration that gives women their first-ever majority in a West German state governing body. The agreement signed Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and the Alternative List gives women eight posts in the 13-member Cabinet administering the city-state of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` Women capture <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' read a front-page headline in the leftist Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has the status of a state in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s federal system and its government is formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The government was scheduled to be formally ratified when the newly elected legislature meets for the first time today. The leftist coalition between the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and the Alternative List _ the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> equivalent of the environmentalist <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ was formed after voters on Jan. 29 stripped the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> of its dominant position in legislature. The Christian Democrat's Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s center-right party, suffered heavy losses in the elections and the party's mayor, <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Diepgen </PERSON>, was forced to give up his post. <PERSON> Diepgen </PERSON> will be replaced by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON>, a Social Democrat. The vote left the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and the Social Democrats with 55 seats each in the legislature, while the Alternative List won 17. The far-right Republicans took 11 seats. With neither mainstream party able to muster a majority, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> entered into a power-sharing agreement with the Alternative List. The Alternative List got three government posts under the agreement and gave all three to women. The Social Democrats named five more.

<TEXT>
 The three Allied military powers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> have abolished a law allowing them to pronounce the death penalty, erasing a controversial regulation adopted 44 years ago, officials say. No one has ever been executed under the now-defunct law, said a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> military spokesman who requested anonymity. But the continued existence of the regulation has irritated many West Berliners. `` The Allies are conscious of many Berliners' objections'' to the law, said a statement issued by French military authorities on Wednesday. `` Beginning today ... no person can be sentenced to death because of violations against the Allies.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> officially control <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> under post-war treaties which left the Soviets in charge of communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The French military spokesman said the three Allies were abolishing the death penalty in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to `` bring their regulations into accordance with German law.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has no death penalty. The spokesman said the law was aimed at preventing attacks against Allied soldiers and officials in the years immediately after <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 1945 defeat.

<TEXT>
 The practice of disposing of pigeons by burying them alive was suspended after an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contacted the mayor's office. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON>, of the society's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters, said he offered to travel to <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> and provide a `` blueprint'' for urban pigeon control that would include alternatives to burying the birds alive in the county landfill. <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> said Tuesday that the society might challenge the practice of burying live birds. `` I would say certainly it violates the spirit, if not the letter, of the anti-cruelty law'' protecting animals in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> said he knew of no other place in the nation where pigeons were buried alive. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadidian </PERSON>, an urban wildlife biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, also said he'd never heard of such a practice elsewhere. <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Scotty </PERSON> <PERSON> Baesler </PERSON>, who was in a meeting Wednesday afternoon, issued a statement that the burials were suspended. He said he was unaware of the practice until it was reported Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> Herald-Leader. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> Humane society, said he was not aware the birds were being buried alive. `` Of course, we see problems with that,'' he said. The city had a year-round trapping program and caught about 125 birds a week, said <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, an aide in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>. He said the pigeons congregate on public buildings and leave smelly droppings. They were removed by city sanitation workers, tied in burlap bags and taken to the landfill, where the bags were buried. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the method combined `` reasonable humaneness and convenience.'' The method was inexpensive, but that was not the deciding factor, he said. <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> said there is no evidence that killing pigeons eliminates the problem in the long run. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> advocates taking measures to limit roosting spots, `` pigeon-proofing'' buildings by placing sharp spikes on roosting areas, frightening the birds with noisemakers and passing laws to limit the food supply from citizens, restaurants and other sources. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said it was expensive to pigeon-proof buildings and that pigeons were smart birds that soon learned to ignore noisemakers and predator decoys. The only solution is to kill the birds, he said Tuesday. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said that despite the apparent success of a pigeon shoot Sunday in downtown <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION> in southeast <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>'s pigeon problem was not bad enough to warrant blocking off downtown and shooting the birds `` I think the problem would have to be much more serious before we'd close the downtown and let -LRB- hunters -RRB- cut loose on them,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>, community development director in <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION>, said 500 to 600 birds, about half the pigeon population there, were killed in Sunday's shoot, and he expected half that many to be killed in a shoot scheduled Saturday. <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> said he had been trying Wednesday to contact <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION> officials to offer them a similar plan for pigeon control but had been unsuccessful. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>, who said he planned no further shoots after Saturday because of `` the media aggravating you to death,'' said he considered the method more humane than live burial. `` I'm not out here choking ours to death,'' he said.

<HEAD>Half of AIDS-Infected Men May Stay Disease-Free 10 Years, Study Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A gay man who becomes infected with the AIDS virus stands a 50-50 chance of going nearly 10 years without developing the disease, suggests a study reported today. The virus may incubate at least 9.8 years in half the gay men it infects, some two years longer than other recent studies suggested, according to the analysis of AIDS among gay men in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. If infected people are given AZT or an aerosol form of the drug pentamidine to stave off development of AIDS, the interval may run longer, said researcher <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>. He and colleague <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacchetti </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> present the work in today's issue of the British journal Nature. The study represents a new approach to estimating AIDS incubation time, and `` it's good work,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalbfleisch </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waterloo </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Kalbfleisch </PERSON>, a statistics professor who has done similar research, said incubation estimates are uncertain because too little time has passed since the earliest AIDS infections to give a clearer picture. For the new work, researchers compared infection rates among <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> gay men since 1978 to monthly totals of new cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The analysis estimated incubation times that would be consistent with the two sets of data. It was not designed to determine the fraction of infected men who would eventually get AIDS, <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said. He said he believed incubation periods seen among people who were infected by transfusions will eventually approach the 9.8-year figure. The work suggests that the number of new AIDS cases among <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> gay men will decline after this year, <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said. Other studies suggest the number of new infections started to decline after 1982, he said. Several teams of researchers had previously estimated AIDS incubation times. Last year, <PERSON> Kalbfleisch </PERSON> and colleague J.F. Lawless suggested that half of adults infected by tainted blood transfusions may still be free of AIDS 7.3 years after infection. Also last year, researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> estimated an average incubation of 7.8 years among 84 gay men. A British economist suggested a 15-year average incubation period in a 1987 analysis of blood transfusion data, but his study has since been criticized by other scientists, <PERSON> Kalbfleisch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bacchetti </PERSON> said. Another transfusion study that year estimated an eight-year average. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 25 percent to 50 percent of infected people will develop AIDS in five to 10 years. AIDS has struck 87,188 Americans and killed 49,976 since June 1981, according to the most recent <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> figures. Sixty-one percent of cases have occurred in gay or bisexual males. The AIDS virus is called human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Scientists Isolate Muscle Protein That Prevents Muscular Dystrophy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Studies of a protein that prevents the most common kind of muscular dystrophy should be aided by today's report of a way to isolate the substance from muscle tissue, researchers say. Scientists do not yet know what the protein does in muscle tissue. But its absence causes <PERSON> Duchenne </PERSON> muscular dystrophy, the most common and severe kind of dystrophy. Isolation of the protein from rabbit muscle is reported in today's issue of the British journal Nature by <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahl </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. They said the isolation method should help research into the protein, called dystrophin. The new study found dystrophin was tightly bound to a second protein. The results suggest the combination of the two proteins may be important for normal muscle structure or function, the researchers said. Duchenne dystrophy is a genetic disorder that strikes boys almost exclusively, appearing in about one in every 3,500 male births in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It causes a progressive weakening and wasting of voluntary muscles. Most patients die in their early 20s.

<HEAD>A Week Later, Only Ripples Left from Tower Defeat</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> has fallen, but the sky has not. For all the forecasts of dire results if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> blocked Tower's path to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, business is proceeding as usual. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the case was closed and accepted Democratic assurances of future cooperation. That does n't undo the resentment among some of Tower's more ardent Republican allies in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and in some corners of the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded like assurances of support from a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats. They ended up with only three Democrats in the close-to-party-line vote against Tower. Nevertheless, a week after the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator was denied confirmation as secretary of defens, the waters have closed. There will be ripples, and some of them could be wave-sized. The good-behavior rules set in the debate over Tower's drinking habits and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be invoked as precedents whenever Republicans spot a Democratic target. `` We've established what will be known as the Tower standards,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>. That argument will be used by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans challenging the financial conduct of House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> But it will be a debating point, not a turning point, in a <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> controversy that was ordained long before the Tower episode. While President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was unwavering in his support of Tower, he burned no bridges to congressional Democrats. He insisted that Tower was the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his choice, even after it was clear that the nomination was doomed. But he did n't get nasty about it, saying there was no point in escalating the fight. `` That's over,'' he said 24 hours after the Tower defeat. `` That's history. And now we are going to go forward.'' The 53-47 vote against Tower was a setback to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the sense that it always is a defeat when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> denies a president something he wants. But this denial did not cost <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a program, or a major campaign pledge, or the support of voters. Indeed, it could turn out that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did the president a favor by sending Tower back to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> instead of to the Pentagon. It was a break <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could not make with a political ally who had been after the Pentagon job since <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was elected president. Tower had not been a Reagan man _ he had supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the 1980 nomination. And the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House went to some lengths to rule the senator out of the job he sought, declaring that the new president would not be nominating any <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican for any Cabinet post. After Tower's long wait, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> displayed his own loyalty, all the way to a losing vote when the standard, somewhat safer course would have been to withdraw the nominee. Tower not only shunned withdrawal; he offered conditions that had to be humiliating, if only the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would let him have the job. Tower promised to quit drinking, taking the pledge on national television. And when that did n't work, he offered to become the first-ever probationary Cabinet member. Republicans proposed that he get the job for a six-month trial and then return for reconfirmation, a gimmick that would have changed the system and could have haunted the presidency. No deal. So Tower became the ninth Cabinet nominee ever to be rejected, the first who was a former senator. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had been fighting for the right of a president to appoint his own Cabinet, but he avoided language that would have raised the political stakes. Tower did not restrain himself. Battling for the job, he said withdrawal would damage <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and rejection would be `` damning the president's judgment.'' He said his nomination had been turned into a vehicle for a major presidential defeat. Tower's advocates on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor said grave constitutional issues were at stake, that the authority of the presidency was on the line, that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will come to rue the rules it wrote in the Tower decision. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said all along that the outcome, either way, would not hurt on other issues. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the pivotal figure in the Tower defeat, agreed. He told his <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> constituents that the Tower rejection would not hurt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s leadership `` In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, ` triumphs' and ` setbacks' are short-lived,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said, `` and that's particularly true of the president.''

<HEAD>Plan to Close More Than 100 Local Offices Announced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is promising better forecasts and fewer false alarms when it completes a reorganization program officials say will close more than 100 local offices. A giant supercomputer, an array of new high-tech radar and automated data collection systems will allow the agency to operate with 800 fewer workers and 115 local offices rather than the approximately 250 now open, says <ORGANIZATION> NWS </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> W. Friday. Friday said the agency hopes to complete the modernization program by 1995, but promised that no local office will be closed until officials are convinced they can do so without hurting local forecast and warning services. Staff cuts will be handled through normal attrition, Friday said, with no current workers expected to lose their jobs. The program is expected to reduce the overall staff from 4,700 people to about 3,900 when it is completed. Despite the <ORGANIZATION> NWS </ORGANIZATION> assurances on Wednesday, the plan is likely to provoke criticism from some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Reports earlier this month that some <ORGANIZATION> NWS </ORGANIZATION> offices might be closed led to quick complaints from senators and representatives anxious to preserve jobs and facilities in their home states. Friday said a list of the 115 communities expected to retain offices would be made public. However, <ORGANIZATION> NWS </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen later told reporters that the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had nixed that plan and the list would not be released. Friday said the improved technology, some of which is being tested in <LOCATION> Norman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, is expected to improve forecasting of severe storms from 60 percent accuracy to 80 percent. That should reduce false alarms an equal amount, he said. He said the automated data collection and processing system will first be installed in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and will be expanded to the remainder of the country once it is proven effective. Major components of the new system will be: _ The Next Generation Weather Radar, which will provide more detailed analysis of storms than current radar, which was installed in the 1960s The new radar can detect wind direction, improving the ability to see tornadoes before they touch the ground, Friday said. _ The Automated Surface Observing System, which will replace many current weather service offices with computerized stations that continually measure temperature, humidity, rainfall, cloud height, wind and visibility These stations will send data now collected by people to central offices for use in writing forecasts. _ A supercomputer will be installed at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, to provide detailed forecasts twice a day to weather service offices for use in preparing local forecasts _ The Advance Weather Interactive Processing System, an upgraded computer forecasting system to be installed in all 115 local offices The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, however, was critical of the plan, saying the new equipment has n't been proven effective. While <ORGANIZATION> NWS </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to provide either a list of weather offices to be closed or those to be kept open, an unofficial map was obtained indicating 113 sites in the 48 contiguous states expected to retain weather forecasting offices. Some locations are approximate, with final decisions yet to be made. The preliminary list includes: <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> and Mobile. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock

<TEXT>
 The Energy Department is urging aviation authorities to restrict flights over its military nuclear reactors to make them more secure against potential terrorist attack. `` We've got a lot to do in that area,'' Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Wednesday. `` It's going to be some time before we get this completely closed.'' The issue was raised by Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., during a hearing in which <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> pledged to give top priority to modernizing and cleaning up the department's nuclear weapons complex, which includes 16 major facilities in 12 states <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> said he was stunned to read a recent report that there are no effective restrictions on airplane flights over the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, whose reactors are the nation's only source of a gas used in nuclear warheads. Those reactors currently are not operating because of safety problems. `` If there is one place where we have fallen down on what is A, B, C in security, it is in this area,'' <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> also includes an Energy Department research laboratory, a plant that makes naval reactor fuel material, two chemical separation plants and a facility that produces weapon-grade plutonium. The only nuclear weapons plant that now has prohibited airspace is the Pantex plant near <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which is the final weapons assembly point. The Charlotte Observer reported in last Sunday's editions that classified security reports obtained by the newspaper in a Freedom of Information Act request showed <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> officials had repeatedly urged the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to ban low-altitude flights over the 300-square-mile facility. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had failed to justify the need for the restrictions, which the aviation agency views as excessive. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he was personally involved in trying to establish the air restrictions, not only at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> but also at other sensitive weapons plants. `` We've got to take a look all around,'' he said, to find ways of better protecting the weapons complex from possible air attacks by terrorists or damage from a crash. `` I believe with the new secretary of transportation and with my personal friend coming into the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, I do n't see any problem getting it reestablished,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. Although he was not more specific, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, a retired admiral, apparently was referring to recent reports that Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> IV, commander of naval forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since March 1987, would be named <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> administrator. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had not yet nominated anyone for the job. The Observer report said that last September, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> dropped its 1983 request to prohibit flights below 14,000 feet for <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and eight other weapons sites. The agency settled for a 2,000-foot minimum limit at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. That restriction, however, is voluntary and not enforceable, the report said.

<HEAD>Baker Plays Down Suggestion that Israel and PLO Talk</HEAD>

 Amid Israeli complaints, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is playing down his suggestion that direct talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> may be needed if alternate peace efforts fail. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations Wednesday that an Israeli-PLO dialogue was difficult to foresee but should not `` categorically'' be ruled out. This represented a shift in tone from Tuesday when he told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that if talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and non-PLO Palestinians do not prosper, `` I suppose we would then have to see negotiations between Israelis and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s remark triggered a telephone call from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, who told the secretary that the statement was `` damaging'' to the prospects for a dialogue between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and non-PLO Palestinians. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, here for official talks, disclosed the phone call to Israeli reporters. At Wednesday's hearing, Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s statement was an `` open invitation'' for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to engage in terrorist activities against Palestinians who choose to bargain with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> replied that he only meant to say in his earlier remarks that an Israeli-PLO dialogue should not be `` categorically, absolutely, totally and completely'' ruled out `` under any and all circumstances,'' because it might help the peace process. The comment did not repudiate what he had said Tuesday but there was a clear change in emphasis. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has steadfastly refused to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and says the dialogue the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opened with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> last December has strengthened the group's hand. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> accused the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday of committing the `` worst atrocities we've ever seen since World War II.'' In his remarks Wednesday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> seemed to hold out little hope that an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, advocated by many <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states, could make a significant contribution to peace. What is needed instead, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, are `` mutually reciprocal and reinforcing steps'' by both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to build confidence. `` Both sides have to take steps,'' he said. The mood at the hearing was generally friendly but there were some hints that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may encounter some resistance, especially on Central American policy. Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said the only aid package he could support for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels would be one leading to their resettlement in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or elsewhere from the base camps where they now are housed in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he believes the Contras should remain intact at least until national elections are held in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> next February. He implied that the rebels could then be reintegrated into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if the elections are fair. The administration is expected to seek a humanitarian aid package for the Contras in the $ 40 million to $ 50 million range in the next few days. On <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said that if the rightist ARENA party wins presidential elections there on Sunday, future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to that country should carry strict conditions because of the ties he said ARENA has with death squad activities. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> replied that it would be a mistake to exaggerate the size of the death squad problem, contending that politically motivated murders averaged 800 per month in 1981 and 1982 compared with 280 per year at present. He added, however, that the administration is aware of continuing human rights problems in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, recalling that Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> raised that issue with Salvadoran officials during a visit there six weeks ago.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Uniform Poll Closing Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The sponsor of legislation that would establish a uniform closing time for polls in 48 of the 50 states says he expects full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval of the bill as early as next month. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure on a voice vote. Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, sponsor of the bill, said he expects the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to approve the measure in early April, but <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has indicated passage could come before the Easter recess which begins March 24. Election officials in the West have charged that the early projection of the winner in the presidential race discourages people from voting in their states and the drop in turnout had affected the outcomes of close local races. Swift, D-Wash., has said previously that studies have shown voter turnout can drop by as much as 2 percent in states where the polls are still open but the winner in a presidential contest is known `` With passage of this legislation we will be one step closer to preserving the integrity of election day not only in the West, but across the country,'' said <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>. <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>'s bill was similar to ones approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> twice before, but both times the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> failed to act. A different version of a uniform poll closing bill is before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Under <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>'s bill, polls would close simultaneously across the country at 9 p.m. EST on election day. In the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> time zone, daylight-saving time would be extended for a maximum of two weeks in presidential election years. The extension would allow polls in that time zone to close at 7 p.m. PDT. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> are exempt from the legislation, but could change their poll closing times if desired. <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> said the need for a uniform closing time became apparent with the 1980 election when television networks projected the results based on exit polling hours before the polls on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> closed. The networks have since agreed not to project election results in a state where the polls have n't closed, but in 1988 the problem was different as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rolled up a large electoral college majority before Western polls closed. <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> said his uniform poll closing bill `` will ensure that voters in all regions of the country will be able to cast their ballots without being told who won the election. `` The networks held to their part of the bargain last November, now it is up to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to send this legislation to the president.'' While a version of a poll closing bill cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commitee </ORGANIZATION> late last year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourned before the the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had an opportunity to act. Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., has introduced legislation that avoids a change in daylight-saving time and simply calls for the polls to close at 7 p.m. Pacific time, 8 p.m. Mountain time, 9 p.m. Central time and 10 p.m. Eastern time <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> spokeswoman, said the chairman of the rules committee, Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., has indicated he expects <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' bill to clear the panel in early April

 Thousands of people, some chanting `` Russians go home,'' marched in twilight across the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to demand <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s full independence and celebrate its first small steps toward democracy. An estimated 100,000 people took to the streets of the capital on Wednesday to mark <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s 1848 revolt against Austrian rule, an anniversary that has become a symbol for reformers demanding greater freedoms. Unlike in previous years, when authorities cracked down on celebrations, the anniversary this year was declared a public holiday and both government and opposition rallies took place peacefully across the nation. In <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, thousands of people sporting national emblems marched, listened to poetry and folk songs and chanted slogans during rallies and other events held throughout the day. Crowds applauded calls for an independent <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the withdrawal of Soviet troops, free elections and a multi-party system and expressed solidarity with jailed activists in neighboring <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries. A five-hour march through the capital to symbolic sites of the 1848 revolution, which <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> crushed in 1849 with the help of Russian troops, was followed in the evening by a candlelight procession across a <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> bridge and up a steep road to the <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Police made no move all day to interfere with the marchers. Pro-democracy activist <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Szilagyi </PERSON>, one of the organizers of Wednesday's mass march through the capital, said this was a sign the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was sincere about taking steps toward democracy. In past years, large numbers of police escorted demonstrators at unofficial gatherings or forcibly dispersed them and detained protest leaders. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> protested violent a police crackdown on a March 15 rally. In a further sign of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s recent reforms and greater independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, no Soviet-style red flags hung anywhere in the capital for the first time on any national holiday in three decades. The day amounted to one of the biggest outpourings of nationalist pride since another unsuccessful Hungarian revolt, the anti-Soviet uprising of 1956, was crushed by Russian tanks. <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamas-Gaspar </PERSON>, a leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, told the crowd gathered before the candlelight march that March 15 was not only a celebration of 1848, but also of 1956. `` The aim is the same,'' he said. `` Constitutional democracy and national independence.'' Wednesday night, a crowd estimated by Western reporters and independent activists to be about 80,000 to 100,000 marched across the river to the castle, with some chanting `` Russians go home.'' Themes of democracy and independence marked events throughout the day, as Hungarians celebrated the newly recognized holiday and recent reforms endorsed by Parliament that could usher in a bona fide multi-party system. <PERSON> Denes </PERSON> <PERSON> Csengey </PERSON>, a popular leader of one of the largest independent groups, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, told a cheering crowd that March 15 should not be the only day of freedom. He spoke in front of the television headquarters where children stood underneath a banner which read `` Free Hungarian Television.'' Referring to a decision by independent groups not to accept an invitation by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders to celebrate jointly, <PERSON> Csengey </PERSON> said the separate celebrations did not mean `` we do n't wish to work toward national unity.''

<HEAD>Oldest Known Record of Total Eclipse Is Younger Than Thought, Study

<TEXT>
 Scientists missed by 150 years in dating the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, a clay tablet that also reflects fear among the ancient observers, researchers said today. Scientists had concluded about 20 years ago that the eclipse, recorded on a clay tablet found in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, occurred on May 3, 1375 B.C. But in today's issue of the British journal Nature, two Dutch scientists report their analysis shows the eclipse really happened about 150 years later, on March 5, 1223 B.C. The tablet was found in 1948 in the ruins of <LOCATION> Ugarit </LOCATION>, an ancient city near <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast. One side appears to tell of a solar eclipse, and the reverse side reads, `` Two livers were examined: danger.'' `` Apparently the anxiety caused by the eclipse of the Sun and the sudden appearance of Mars had to be resolved by an explanation through liver divination,'' wrote the researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amsterdam </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Leiden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. They concluded that the earlier text analysis of the tablet misidentified the time of year in which the eclipse occurred. The new study indicated the eclipse really happened in late February or early March. In addition, the text apparently indicates that Mars was visible at the time of the eclipse, the Dutch researchers said. They compared those criteria and the likely age range for the tablet to a list of possible total solar eclipses visible from <LOCATION> Ugarit </LOCATION>. Only the event in 1223 B.C. fills the bill, the researchers said. In an accompanying editorial, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> B.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> cautioned that their conclusion `` can best be regarded as a plausible hypothesis.'' The translation of the tablet's text is not certain, and the study assumes that citizens of <LOCATION> Ugarit </LOCATION> followed an Egyptian-style calendar, for which no supporting evidence is available, he said. Even if the tablet is 150 years younger than previously believed, it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Griffith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview. The next-oldest record was made in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Eighth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B.C. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION>, a researcher in ancient astronomy.

 Actress <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> says she has relied on cosmetic surgery for more than 20 years to help her remain a leading lady. The most recent operation was a 1986 neck tuck, she said in April's <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>'s magazine.

She said she had a facelift before opening in 1966 in `` Mame,'' the role for which she won the first of her four <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> awards. The next surgery was in 1969 `` to get rid of the little puffy bags that I'd always had under my eyes,'' she said. She said she had her neck and chin redone in 1976. She said she wanted to talk openly about the operations because `` cosmetic surgery should n't be just the secret of actresses and socialites now that it's available to anyone who wants it and can afford it.''

 As his only non-family, non-official guest on becoming secretary of veterans affairs, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> chose World War II cartoonist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON>, who says the new department `` sounds like the same old bureaucracy under a different name.'' <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON>, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, created the bedraggled dogfaces <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> for the soldier's newspaper `` Stars and Stripes.'' `` <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> told the truth of the war, World War II, and the fatigue, sadness, anxiety and humor of the period,'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said in his remarks on the White House South Lawn, with <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON> close to him on the podium. <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON>, 67, was a constituent when <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> represented the South Side of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> during 12 terms in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. During an interview before Wednesday's ceremony, <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON> said he knew <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> only slightly, and did not know whose idea it was to make him a prominent part of the day's events. <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON> carries a few more pounds and gray hairs than he did in slogging his way up the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in 1943-1944, where he collected a minor shoulder wound from a German mortar round that inspired one of his best panels _ Soldier, standing, to medic, seated at a table with boxes of medals before him: `` Just gim me the aspirin. I already got a purple heart.'' He told two reporters, one from Stars and Stripes, `` I ca n't help thinking <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> knows my attitude'' as an opponent of the large, main-line veterans groups and of what he saw as their grasping attitude. `` We were against the special philosophy, if you're a veteran you're a special case,'' he said. `` Just by virtue of being a veteran, I do n't think that entitles a guy to a gravy-train ride for the rest of his life.'' <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON> belonged to the tiny <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, serving two terms as chairman, and has not used any veterans benefits. `` We backed the GI bill, but our slogan was, ` Citizens First, Veterans Second,''' he said. `` I have n't paid dues for years, but they still send me mail. `` There are millions of guys for whom the military experience was the one great experience of their lives. I do n't blame them for wanting to sit around on a Saturday night with their friends and tell lies about their experience.'' <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON> said he had not paid close attention to veterans affairs recently, so his opinions had to be tentative. _ Agent Orange: Veterans are being forced to try to prove illnesses are connected to exposure to that defoliant, but `` the burden of proof ought to be on the government Those kids ought to have it made up to them. I'm very much in favor of a liberal hand'' in compensation. _ A <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> department replacing the old Veterans Administration: `` It sounds like the same bureaucracy under a different name ... maybe it will be entirely different.'' He was not at all tentative on universal service. `` I think it's great, the idea of putting two or three years of a young man's -LRB- or woman's -RRB- life into public service,'' he said. `` If you're not inclined to the military, then CCC-type work.'' The CCC was the <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, a depression-era agency tha provided jobs, clothes and food for young men in camps working on conservation projects. `` I think everyone owes his country a few years out of his life, just a short period, two years, maybe three.'' The point of this, he said, is to `` make better citizens out of them.. bond them to their country. Though many proponents of universal service have said the ending of the draft in 1973 ended valuable lessons in democracy through the military's mixing of classes, races and viewpoints, <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON> said he thought `` the sociology is obviously a side benefit.'' <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON> himself enlisted in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in 1940, more than a year before the entry of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into World War II, because, `` I had some friends in the unit I wanted to be with. ...

 The Roman Catholic church where parishioners rebelled over the removal of a Polish priest has reopened, but church authorities revealed that the priest has been suspended by his superiors. Police have guarded St. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> the Archangel church since it was closed Feb. 18 by <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> after a weeklong sit-in by about 200 dissidents upset over the sudden, unexplained ouster of the Rev. Roman Palaszewski. There were relatively few worshipers Wednesday at four early morning Masses, two celebrated in English and two in Polish, said the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyka </PERSON>, associate pastor. `` It was very, very emotional,'' <PERSON> Smyka </PERSON> said. `` The 6:30 Mass _ I think I cried through half of it. It was just so good to be back in the church. I mean, that's what our business is as priests.'' Some parishioners said they were overjoyed by the church's reopening Some said they heard about it by word-of-mouth, or by making daily drives by the church since the announcement that it would reopen. Monsignor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON> was suspended indefinitely for defying orders from his Franciscan superiors in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, to return to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last month. `` He's still ordained, but he can not function as a priest because he did n't obey his superior who commanded him, under obedience, to return to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON> said `` He would not be able to say Mass or administer the sacraments.'' <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON>, who spent three years at the church under an agreement between his superiors in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and Franciscan officials in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, has been in seclusion in the <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> area since his removal in December. About 50 worshipers attended a Lenten prayer service Wednesday evening. They entered the church under the watchful eye of a police officer sitting in a van parked discreetly across the street. Four or five dissidents watched quietly from across the street Wednesday evening as worshipers entered the church. They then gathered at a Polish club a block from the church to plan a demonstration outside the church this weekend on Palm Sunday, the start of the holiest week in the church year. `` They did n't heal our wounds _ everything is the same,'' said <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON>, a parishioner for 25 years and one of the protest leaders. She was unaware of Wednesday's opening, but said she and many other protesters plan to boycott services because they do n't believe their complaints have been addressed, <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON> said. The dissidents are demanding <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON>'s return to the parish and the removal of the church's pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bambol </PERSON>, who they claim engineered <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON>'s removal because of his popularity among recent immigrants. They also question <PERSON> Bambol </PERSON>'s commitment to maintaining the church's <LOCATION> Polis </LOCATION> traditions. <PERSON> Bambol </PERSON>'s supporters have said <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON> paid scant attention to parishioners who were not recent immigrants. A weeklong sit-in by about 200 dissidents who occupied the church in shifts ended early Feb. 18 when church authorities summoned police to expel them. Two who refused to leave voluntarily were charged with trespassing. <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> suspended Masses indefinitely the same day. <PERSON> Bambol </PERSON> said after the prayer service that the dissidents are welcome to return as long as they `` abide by the rules of the church.'' He said he was `` very joyful, very happy'' that the church had reopened. `` After all we were all suffering for so long unjustifiably ... we are happy to be back in harness, so to speak,'' he said. `` This is a period of reconciliation.''

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gunmaker is suspending sales of a semiautomatic assault-style rifle following imposition of an import ban on similar foreign-made firearms frequently used by drug dealers. `` We want to conform to the spirit of the law although we were n't specifically mentioned in the letter of the law,'' <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said Wednesday after announcing the voluntary suspension of sales of the company's AR15, a semiautomatic version of the military's M-16 The action came one day after the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration announced a ban on imports of several foreign-made semiautomatic weapons that police say have contributed to a nationwide wave of drug-related killings. Calls for controls also increased after an assault rifle was used in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> schoolyard attack that killed five children earlier this year. Administration officials said the move may just be temporary, but that with import applications skyrocketing, they wanted to head off an imminent surge of the deadly firearms entering the country. Colt's voluntary move to halt AR15 sales was lauded by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the nation's drug control director, as `` an act of civic responsibility.'' <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> added, `` It's amazing how this thing is just taking off.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> on Tuesday announced the suspension of pending import permits for more than 110,000 semiautomatic rifles until the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> can review if their intended use fits the requirement that they be sport weapons. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked Wednesday if the president would expand the review to domestic models, said, `` There are no plans of that kind anticipated.'' But <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said Colt will permanently halt sales of the AR15 to civilians `` if it is determined by the government review that semiautomatic rifles are not appropriate for the commercial market.'' He would not reveal how many of the rifles Colt makes. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Risch </PERSON> of Handgun Control, one of the country's leading gun control advocates, called the move by Colt `` unprecedented.'' But when asked about the possible impact on crime, <PERSON> Risch </PERSON> said, `` Zero.'' `` There are a couple of million of them already out on the streets, gun stores already have large stocks of ones already imported and domestically made ones, and yesterday's action does n't do anything to stop them from selling those,'' <PERSON> Risch </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gwynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Peirson </PERSON>, retired professor of criminology at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a police officer for 23 years in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said the ban on imports will have no immediate impact, but ultimately could if it is made permanent. `` It will have to trickle down and we may not even see the impact next year,'' he said. `` The only thing the ban will do in the short run is to increase the price of the available weapons.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said halting imports will have little impact on crime. It said the government is targeting law-abiding citizens and their guns, not criminals who will ignore gun-control laws anyway. `` If we leave this guy out on the street, he operates outside of all of our laws and he sneers at society and he's going to be a major problem,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>. The Colt AR15 is the most similar U.S.-made weapon to those covered by the import ban, such as semiautomatic versions of AK-47s and Uzi carbines, <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> said. The suspension on imports does not affect thousands of other semiautomatic rifles awaiting import permits, he said. `` The ones that do n't look like automatic weapons are still coming in,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> maintains that only cosmetic differences exist between the different weapons. <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> that it is extremely difficult to convert such weapons into fully automatic guns, as members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and gun control advocates elsewhere have contended. According to estimates by the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> and gun control activists, there are 60 million to 70 million firearms in private hands in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including 20 million to 30 million semiautomatic weapons ranging from pistols to the assault-style rifles. But it is unclear exactly how many semiautomatic rifles are produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as manufacturers are not required to report their output with such detail, <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> said. In 1987, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> produced a total of 1.76 million handguns and 1.01 million rifles, including regular bolt and pump action armaments as well as semiautomatics, <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> said. That was a 300,000 jump in both categories _ handguns and rifles _ from the previous year, and officials believe the number probably increased in 1988.

 About 200,000 spectators will converge on this <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> military base to watch Discovery land early Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> predicted. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON> said Wednesday that the crowd would be that big `` because it's a weekend landing at the beginning of spring vacation.'' The space shuttle and its five-man crew is scheduled to touch down at 6:34 a.m., capping a five-day mission highlighted by deployment of a $ 100 million communications satellite and experiments aimed at developing new medicines and learning how bones heal and chicken embryos develop in the weightlessness of space. Trouble with a valve on board Discovery had threatened to end the mission a day early, but it was apparently fixed Wednesday and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is aiming for a Saturday landing. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday that because of a desire to perform handling and braking tests, Discovery might land on concrete Runway 22 instead of on its normal landing strip, Runway 17, which is on the unpaved, clay surface of <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>. Runway 17 is roughly three miles from the public viewing site on the lakebed's east shore. Runway 22 is about 4.5 miles, but `` it's still a good view You'll see ` em fly right past,'' <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, five airmen playing the role of injured astronauts were rescued Wednesday from a make-believe space shuttle fire in an emergency drill by ground crews who will greet Discovery when it returns Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> routinely holds such simulations before real shuttle landings. The east shore viewing site will be open to the public 24 hours before the landing, and vehicle passes are not required. But gates to the main parts of <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> will be closed to anyone not on official business. Access to the viewing site will be closed one hour before the landing, <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON> said the two largest crowds for shuttle landings numbered 500,000, when <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> landed here on July 4, 1982; and 410,000 on Oct. 3 when Discovery glided to the desert floor to complete the first shuttle flight since Challenger blew up after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986.

<TEXT>
 State and congressional housing experts say a federal panel charged with coordinating programs for the homeless has done little or nothing to address the problem. Witnesses at a congressional hearing Wednesday lambasted the <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on the Homeless, saying it has not met its legislative mandate. The criticism came at a joint hearing of two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panels as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on housing introduced legislation touted by sponsors as `` the framework for a new national housing strategy.'' The litany of the council's failures began in the opening statement from Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., who chairs the Government Activities and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said the council `` has failed almost completely to carry out the mandates set for it by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. The council was established in 1987 by Title II of the McKinney Act to coordinate 20 new programs created by the act. It is supposed to provide information on the programs and help state and local governments and non-profit organizations implement them. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the Employment and Housing subcommittee, said much of the information that homeless providers needed to apply for <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> money was provided instead by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION> testified that after receiving numerous questions from states, she developed a report on the status of programs under the McKinney Act and related legislation. She said the report has now been updated three times. `` This publication contains the type of information the council should be disseminating,'' said <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>. Other witnesses said the council, in a year and a half since enactment of <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, failed to hire a complete staff or identify regional and field coordinators for programs. It focused too much on the development of an electronic data base which housing providers could not use, often sent information regarding application deadlines late, met just five times and produced only three monthly newsletters which contained useless information, the witnesses said. <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the council's former executive director, blamed a lack of resources. `` The duties with which the council is charged and its ability to carry them out must be brought into balance,'' she said. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave the council broad authority to develop programs and issue timetables but not the power or resources to do the job. She recommended increasing the staff size and removing the council from the administrative wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which she said has been unwilling to share information. The council, composed of the heads or their designees of 10 Cabinet departments and five independent agencies, was headed under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration by then-housing secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has yet to choose his successor.

 Federal officials prepared to vaccinate 5,000 people at an Indian reservation today as the nation's largest current outbreak of meningitis claimed a fifth victim. A 17-year-old girl died early Wednesday, becoming the fifth victim in south-central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this year. Seventeen people, mostly children, have contracted meningitis or another form of meningococcal disease since Jan. 10. `` It is very tragic and we are very concerned,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Topel </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Yakima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are in an outbreak situation.'' Although there are isolated cases of meningococcal disease around the country all the time, the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> outbreak is the largest current cluster, said Dr. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuchat </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The mortality rate of nearly 30 percent in the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> cases is far higher than the national average of 10 percent among the 3,000 annual cases, she said. The six meningitis cases involve a bacteria that attacks the lining around the spinal cord and brain, while the meningococcemia cases involve a bacteria that attacks the blood stream, Ms. <PERSON> Schuchat </PERSON> said. Doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> plan to study the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> outbreak to see if a particularly deadly strain of the meningococcal bacteria is involved. Anxious parents have deluged county and state health officers with phone calls wondering if they should have their children vaccinated, officials said. County health officials vaccinated 2,300 people in two communities where schoolchildren were exposed to the bacteria by an infected child, doctors said. In addition, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> planned to begin vaccinating 5,000 residents of the <ORGANIZATION> Yakima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION> today because Indians living in close quarters were considered at greater risk of contracting the disease. No decision has been reached yet on whether to vaccinate more than 60,000 people under age 25 in the entire county of 184,000 residents, Ms. <PERSON> Topel </PERSON> said. The vaccinations are given to people under age 25 because most adults who become infected with the bacteria do not become sick. The latest victim had been hospitalized since Feb. 7, after reporting a flu-like illness, he said. The others who have died were three children under the age of 18 months and a 23-year-old man. No new cases have been confirmed since last weekend and officials have no other suspected cases.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar finished higher Thursday against the Japanese yen, while share prices erased earlier gains and lost ground on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 130.73 yen, up 0.85 yen from Wednesday's close of 129.88 yen The currency opened at 130.68 yen and moved in a range of 130.60-130 .95 yen The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 376.13 points the previous day, erased its gains earlier in the day and lost 2.24 points, or 0.007 percent, to finish at 32,098.24. Currency dealers attributed the dollar's rise to a report Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that the nation's trade deficit fell to $ 9.49 billion in January from a revised December shortfall of $ 10.99 billion.

Trading companies and foreign banks bought the currency, boosting the dollar's rise, he said. The dollar is unlikely to continue to rise although a majority of market players were in a dollar-buying mood, another dealer said anonymously.

<HEAD>Study: Heart Failure Drug Not as Good as Old Standby</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 200-year-old mainstay of treatment for congestive heart failure will continue to play its key role after research showed that a highly touted replacement is not as good for many patients, experts say. When testing began several years ago with the new drug, called milrinone, some experts predicted it would supplant digitalis as the medicine of choice for the 4 million Americans with congestive heart failure. The latest study, published today, compared milrinone to a form of digitalis called digoxin in people with mild to moderate heart failure. Although milrinone worked, it was not as effective as digoxin. Those receiving it did worse and suffered more side effects. `` The clinical wisdom of a few years ago that it would be a replacement for digitalis is not correct,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBianco </PERSON>, who directed the study. `` It will not replace digitalis.'' Experts said the findings were surprising and disappointing. But in an editorial published with the study in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The good news for now is that digoxin can be used with greater confidence in its efficacy.'' Doctors also said there should still be a place for milrinone because it may be used in people who can not tolerate digitalis. <PERSON> DiBianco </PERSON> said he would like to be able to prescribe milrinone for such people, but `` for the majority of my patients, digitalis now even more firmly becomes the standard drug.'' DiBianco, a researcher at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Adventist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Takoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was the study's principal author. Research was conducted on 230 patients at 32 hospitals. An injected form of milrinone, produced by Sterling Drug, was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> last year for short-term treatment of acute heart failure. However, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has yet to clear the medicine's pill form, which was used in the latest study. In the three-month comparison study, patients with mild to moderate heart failure were randomly assigned to take milrinone, diuretics, digoxin or a combination of these drugs. The conditions of 20 percent of those taking milrinone deteriorated within two weeks after treatment began, compared with only 3 percent of those receiving digoxin. Side effects of milrinone included palpitations, irregular heartbeat, lightheadedness, low blood pressure, nervousness and headaches. Among those who once suggested that milrinone might replace digitalis was Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baim </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. His early results showed that the drug helped people with severe congestive heart failure who did not respond to other medicines. Although the latest results are disappointing, he said, `` I still believe that there is a clear beneficial role in the patient who has heart failure that is refractory to the conventional agents.''

<TEXT>
 Images of violence, catchy music and casual character assassination were among the dominant features of an election campaign that tried to stick to the airwaves and stay off of the streets. For one thing, radio and television advertisements were much safer than public appearances in this country, where expressing your political preference can be lethal. The campaign ended Wednesday with a burst of such advertistments and a rally by the leftist Democratic Convergence. No campaigning is permitted from today until Sunday's presidential balloting. The political parties knew that more than 85 percent of Salvadorans homes have radios, the most pervasive medium in a country where personal messages from one town to another are relayed between songs on music stations. There are 51 AM stations in the country of 5.5 million people _ 3 million radio receivers and 4.5 million daily listeners. Now Salvadorans are being asked to go to the polls to pick a president under the threat of violence by the leftist guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, whose nine-year war against the U.S.-supported government has claimed 70,000 lives. The rebels, as in previous elections, have threatened violence and urged voters to stay home on election day. In 1984, nearly 75 percent of the voters cast ballots. They chose <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> as president and gave a strong second place to a surging right-wing party _ the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> _ that now threatens to wrest power from the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. Political parties avoided big rallies both in the capital and in the countryside during this year's four-month campaign. A <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> rally on Saturday was the largest of the campaign, drawing more than 20,000 people in the capital. Most election work was carried out by party volunteers working city blocks and at so-called `` carnivals,'' where party leaders mingled with the people while local bands played and liquor flowed. Several people were killed in the early days of the campaign. The leftist guerrillas threatened city mayors, then killed nine of them, and leaders of the two dominant parties accused each other of political slayings. As a result, all the parties took the lion's share of their campaigns to the airwaves. Several sectors of society, principally the Roman Catholic church, harshly criticized the mudslinging that marked the ads. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> ran a television ad that showed a blood-covered man's body on the floor, followed by an image of a similarily butchered woman. `` This is the kind of violence <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> brought to the country,'' says a guttural voice over a horror movie soundtrack, playing on accusations that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, is linked to right-wing death squads who killed thousands of reputed leftists in the early 1980s. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> ran radio ads alleging that <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> embezzled or squandered millions of dollars, some of it destined for victims of the 1986 earthquake. Both parties denied each other's accusations. The leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convergence </ORGANIZATION> ran television ads showing soldiers firing on crowds while a voice sang, `` Let me not be indifferent to pain.'' The three parties flooded the airwaves on Wednesday, but the well-funded rightist party had by far the most broadcast time. `` Of course, not only do we benefit from the propaganda, but we block others,'' said an <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> campaign organizer, speaking on condition of anonymity. But the airwaves are n't reserved for the parties. The rebels spoke to voters with their clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION>, taking credit for an attack on the presidential palace and threatening election workers in an effort to enforce their election boycott.

 Riot police stormed a subway depot and arrested more than 2,300 workers who staged a wildcat strike today, paralyzing <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s subway system and stranding thousands of commuters. Most of the system's workers went on strike to demand dismissal of the subway chief for bad faith in labor negotiations. The government organized emergency transport with about 10,000 extra buses and military vehicles. The 3 million people who use the subway daily in the city of about 10 million people struggled to find alternate transport. Buses were packed and taxis carried up to five passengers each. About 4,000 riot police stormed a subway depot to disperse 3,000 strikers who had seized the facility during the night and erected barricades. Police armored trucks fired tear gas and bulldozers knocked down the barricades. Some strikers, armed with steel pipes and clubs, hurled firebombs at police before they were overpowered. Police officials said 2,344 strikers had been arrested at the subway depot. Most would be released, but charges were being prepared against about 30 union leaders for leading an illegal strike, the officials said. Officials of the city-owned <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said they were maintaining limited service on some lines with managers, non-striking workers and locomotive drivers from the national railroad system, officials said. A sudden snow storm that hit <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> during the morning added to congestion and confusion in streets clogged with heavy traffic. Subway officials said about 6,000 of the system's 7,732 workers were involved in the protest. It was the first strike in the subway's 15-year history apart from a two-hour stoppage last June. Mayor <PERSON> Koh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kun </PERSON> apologized to commuters for the inconvenience. `` We want the strikers to return to work and drop their unjust demands,'' he said. Subway President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Myong-nong </PERSON> ordered strikers to return to work by early Friday or face disciplinary action. But union officials, who declined to be named, said they had no intention of returning until their demands were met and all arrested strikers were released and charges dropped. The strikers had ignored a government order for a 15-day cooling off period imposed late Wednesday after last-minute negotiations failed on their demand that the subway corporation president be dismissed. Union leaders said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> had acted in bad faith during earlier labor talks and demanded <PERSON> Koh </PERSON> sign a new agreement on pay and working conditions because they did not trust the subway corporation. The mayor said he could not sign the agreement because he did not represent the subway corporation. Strikers also demanded withdrawal of law suits against labor leaders who organized protests last week. Subway workers allowed commuters to ride free for four days last week.

 Three years ago, the <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police switched from their old brown-on-brown police cars, hoping for a new image.

 Hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> live in a world of hopelessness and neglect, imprisoned as much by public indifference as by their extremist captors, a former hostage says in an editorial published today. <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, a French journalist held by Shiite Moslem kidnappers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for three years, marked the anniversary of the capture of fellow hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> with a wrenching plea for rekindled interest in the captives. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was captured four years ago today and has been held longer than any of the other 14 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In today's editions of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> says the hostages are no longer objects of mass compassion, no longer bargaining chips, no longer even political symbols. `` The truth is that the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today have become the damned of the West,'' he wrote. `` Without hope of being saved, imprisoned in silence and darkness, deprived of the sight of the world of the living, forgotten, they no longer represent anything.'' Hostages such as <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> are kept blindfolded and chained, robbed of their humanity, he wrote. `` This absence of senses is the worst punishment that one can inflict on a human being. The most tragic thing is that this torment is administered as much from the outside by countries and people indifferent to their fate as on the inside by their captors, who also work to make them ` insignificant' as men.'' The captors `` condemned us to the chain, they made us blind better to bend us and subjugate us. We had to become things. A hostage is above all a package, which is logical because he is the object of a swap.'' He said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also consider the hostages `` as merchandise'' and `` in believing they are devaluing the hostages by abandonment and silence ... have made them non-existent ... The Western hostages no longer exist for anybody except for their families.'' Perhaps the governments `` think the kidnappers will end up by getting tired and letting them go,'' <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> said. `` But this calculation has proved false.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> won the release of its countrymen because it `` cared about its hostages,'' he said. `` It was the spirit of solidarity of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> people that provoked the political will of the government.'' Nearly all <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> dailies today devoted stories to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who also was the subject of numerous radio reports. Radio <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> network carried reports on <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> nearly every half hour during prime time morning newscasts. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist who escaped after two months of captivity in 1987, said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>: `` Now is the time for the kidnappers and those for whom they work to release <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and the other hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and show the world that they believe in the mercy of God.'' <PERSON> Hesham </PERSON> el Essawy, chairman of the London-based <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Promotion of Religious Tolerance, said: `` We hope and pray that this tragic situation will end soon. We are very confident that this aspiration will be supported by every honest Moslem in the world today.'' Their statements were released through Article 19, an anti-censorship organization. Also, the Australian Journalists' Association today called on the <LOCATION> Australian </LOCATION> government to take whatever steps necessary to aid in the release of the hostages. Association federal secretary <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said the group also has written <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> asking them to intervene. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> was released May 4, 1988, with French diplomats <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>. Islamic Jihad, the group that holds <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, kidnapped <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> on May 22, 1985. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> spent his last six months of captivity in the company of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages, first <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 57, acting dean of agriculture at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>, was abducted June 9, 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> 56, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON> romance of a 16-year-old Greek Cypriot schoolgirl and a 17-year-old Turkish settler has stirred political passions on this divided east Mediterranean island. The love story has underlined the deep-rooted divisions that plague <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> 15 years after <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded and seized the northern one-third of the island. And even though the young man was deported this week by Greek Cypriot officials, the story in its small way symbolizes hopes of reunification as leaders of the rival communities try to find ways to bring them together. There was an uproar in the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> south in September when the Turkish Moslem, <PERSON> Cengis </PERSON> <PERSON> Coksun </PERSON> <PERSON> Seytan </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chronia </PERSON>, a Christian, were married in a widely publicized Moslem ceremony in the north. <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> was only 15 at the time. She is only the second Greek Cypriot girl known to have married a Turk since the 1974 invasion. Her family is part of a small, isolated Greek community in the <LOCATION> Karpas </LOCATION> region of the north following the flight or expulsion of 200,000 Greek Cypriots after the invasion. Greek Cypriots were incensed not just that one of their own would marry a Turk but one of the 50,000 mainland Turks shipped to the north to increase the <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> population, which is outnumbered 4-1 by Greek Cypriots. The Greek Cypriots demand the withdrawal of all the settlers and some 30,000 Turkish troops from the north before a settlement can be reached on reunification. Hardline Greek Cypriots alleged the girl had been kidnapped. Some officers in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force believe the hardliners sought to undermine the talks between their political leaders. The Greek Cypriot press angrily demanded action by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force, which supervises the living conditions of the Greek Cypriots left in <LOCATION> Karpas </LOCATION>, to rescue <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON>. High school students staged protest demonstrations demanding <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> action. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officers reported they found no evidence of coercion and that <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> was happy. Greek Cypriots called that a cover-up. Anger was fueled when Turkish Cypriot television, seen in the south, broadcast the marriage of <LOCATION> Cengis </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> and announced that <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> had given the couple an expensive wedding present. Greek Cypriot newspapers claimed the marriage was a Turkish attempt to prove to the world that the mainland settlers were being assimilated and were even acceptable to Greek Cypriots. In February, when <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> crossed to the south she claimed she had indeed been kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam before being pushed into marrying Seytan. A few weeks later, Seytan slipped across the so-called Green Line that divides the island to become a Christian so he and <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> could live in the more prosperous south. He was immediately arrested and held in jail on charges he had kidnapped <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> and entered the republic of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> illegally. <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> then changed her story, saying she had been forced by her own family to concoct the kidnap story to save them from the humiliation of her love for a Turk and conversion to Islam. `` I'd go to the end of the world to be with him,'' she said of the curly haired Seytan. <PERSON> Seytan </PERSON> said during a brief court appearance: `` I love her. I want to see her. Why wo n't they let me?'' Nonetheless, the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> authorities ruled that he should be deported as an illegal immigrant. They carried out the order Tuesday. He was flown to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, and then to <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> said she does n't know what she will do, but had no plans to go to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Some Greek Cypriots newspapers insist that <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON>'s denial of being kidnapped followed Turkish warnings they would harm her family still in the north if she told the truth. But other newspapers have become sympathetic and urged tolerance. `` If these two youngsters are really in love, why do n't we accept the fact and let them live in peace,'' the independent <PERSON> Epikeri </PERSON> weekly said in an editorial. `` Why do we object so violently and fight this possibility?''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says the current <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour of Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> is a hostile affront to Moslems who want <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to ban <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday accused the British government of trying to exploit the trip and `` give a cold shoulder'' to the world's Moslems. But it warned that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> could not avoid facing `` their wrath.'' On the second day of their official visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> Wednesday, the heir to the British throne and his wife were steeped in <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> traditions. There was camel racing, sword dancing and open-air lamb roasting. The couple is on an official one-week tour of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and the Emirates that was announced last June. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> will then fly alone to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for a private visit. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio, monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, noted that the visit was taking place while the 45-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> was meeting in the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, with `` The Satanic Verses'' at the top of the agenda. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Wednesday told conference delegates it was honored to have broken relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair. It reiterated its call for the execution of Indian-born British author first issued Feb. 14 by fundamentalist patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. `` Now under such circumstances when the British government has applied all its resources for inflicting a blow upon Islam and insulting our prophet, how can the presence of the British crown prince in Islamic states be justified?'' said a commentary by <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. Many Moslems say `` The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by suggesting the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, was invented by the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> rather than received directly from God, and for giving prostitutes the names of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives.

<TEXT>
 A convicted cop-killer granted clemency in 1985 may go free as early as Friday, said state parole officials who voted to release him. A three-member panel of the state Board of Parole voted unanimously Wednesday to release <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON>, who some saw as an unrepentant murderer. But <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> also had some well-known supporters, including folk singer <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON>, conservative columnist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> and civil rights lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>. `` It's been a long haul. I've been in this for 13 -LCB- years,'' said <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>. `` I'm happy for <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, his wife and his family.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON>, the prosecutor who won the 25 years to life sentences handed <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON>, 44, and co-defendant <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Culhane </PERSON>, said the parole board's decision was `` a sad commentary on our criminal justive system.'' Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s grant of clemency for <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> on New Year's Eve 1985 was denounced by many <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law enforcement officials and by then Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> At the time, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> was considered a potential 1988 presidential contender. Although <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s clemency made <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> immediately eligible for parole consideration, the state board twice refused to free him before Wednesday's hearing at <LOCATION> Otisville </LOCATION> state prison where <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> was being held. The board's executive director, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Elwin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> could be freed as early as Friday. Through three trials, <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Culhane </PERSON> steadfastly maintained their innocence in the 1968 shooting death of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputy, during an escape attempt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, the 86-year-old brother of the slain deputy, said <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> should have been kept in prison for life. `` But what are you going to do?'' he said after the parole board decision. `` There's nothing I can do about it.'' <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> was n't granting interviews Wednesday, but <PERSON> Culhane </PERSON> said his friend's parole was `` wonderful.'' <PERSON> Culhane </PERSON> said he felt the parole board's decision might help his bid for early release. Thus far, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has refused to grant <PERSON> Culhane </PERSON> clemency and he's not eligible for a parole hearing until late 1991. That's when <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> would have been first eligible for parole without <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s clemency. In the past, the board had cited the serious nature of the crime in keeping <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> behind bars. On Wednesday, the board noted <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON>'s `` outstanding record'' while in prison. Leading the effort to win <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON>'s freedom has been free-lance writer <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Culp </PERSON>, a former newspaper reporter who met <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> while he was in prison and married him on the 10th anniversary of the shooting. <PERSON> Elwin </PERSON> said <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> and his wife planned to live at her home in <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. That's not far from where <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON>, <PERSON> Culhane </PERSON> and inmate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowerman </PERSON>, according to prosecutor <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON>, tried to escape while being transported from state prison to a court appearance. At the time, <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Culhane </PERSON> were serving state prison sentences for the armed robbery of a gas station. <PERSON> Bowerman </PERSON>, a jailhouse lawyer, was helping them appeal their convictions. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bowerman </PERSON> were fatally shot and <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Culhane </PERSON> were wounded. <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON> said it was <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> who fired the shot that killed <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>. Even though <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Culhane </PERSON> have maintained <PERSON> Bowerman </PERSON> acted alone, a second deputy in the car, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, said they were involved. Singer has since committed suicide.

The psychiatrist examined the woman last week. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who faces charges of criminal trespassing, burglary, possession of marijuana and larceny, yelled out to reporters as she entered the courthouse and spoke out in court, although warned not to by the judge. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> shrieked: `` I'm ready to talk. I've had enough. I've seen enough.'' Under <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s order, a panel made up of a psychiatrist, a psychologist and a social worker from the state psychiatric hospital in <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION> will examine <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Niantic </LOCATION> state prison for women. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> has been held at the prison in lieu of $ 5,000 bail since her arrest for breaking into <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION> on Feb. 28, the second time in five days she was found inside <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s unoccupied house She was allegedly wearing one of <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s watches and told authorities she was there cleaning <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> also was arrested twice last spring for breaking into his home in the exclusive community about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Train Engineer Told To Stop Readings, Greetings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the more than 400 commuters riding the <LOCATION> Rockport-to-Boston </LOCATION> train, the days of poetry readings and words of good cheer have ended. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, engineer of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> Train No. 110, has been told to stop talking to passengers over the public address system. The 42-year-old <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, a railroad man since he was a teen-ager and an engineer for 15 years, began his commentaries soon after taking over No. 110 two years ago. He began by making occasional observations about the weather and other things as the train passed through marshlands leading into <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. He expanded his repertoire last month after returning from a vacation that included a train ride from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> during which he heard a club-car attendant recite poetry as part of his announcement he was closing the bar. `` I thought, ` Wow, what a great idea,''' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said. And he began short readings, usually poetry and always something he considered upbeat. He read while he drove the train through a work zone at 2 mph and kept one hand on the brake. Passengers thanked him as they walked past his cab, and they wrote letters commending him. One called him `` the goodwill ambassador of the commuter rails.'' But after pulling into North Station on Wednesday morning, <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> supervisor told him unnamed higher-ups wanted him to stop. The <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> hires <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> to run its commuter trains. `` He told me the feeling is that somebody, someday, is going to say something like, ` How is he going to be able to drive the train while doing that sort of thing?''' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> supervisor, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxton </PERSON>, declined to discuss the matter, but transit authority spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimond </PERSON> said his agency was concerned after the newspaper inquired about <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>'s popularity. <PERSON> Dimond </PERSON> said officials thought what <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> was doing was a direct violation of regulations. `` Engineers are expected to give undivided attention to driving the train and not doing anything but driving the train,'' he said. Earlier, <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said: `` I have not been seeking notoriety. I began because I noticed that people getting off the train were never smiling, that it always seemed to be ` back to the salt mines' for them ... I do this because of the positive effect that it has on people.''

<HEAD>Witnesses Say Gunman Methodical During Shooting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Witnesses recounted brushes with death and identified a 61-year-old retired librarian as the gunman who killed six people and wounded 10 in a 1987 shooting rampage. During an emotional third day of testimony in <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday, eight witnesses said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> was purposeful, precise and without emotion during the shootout at two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> supermarkets in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s eastern coast. `` It was n't a zombie-type look,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who helped usher people to safety during the April 23, 1987 attack and came within about 15 feet of the gunman at one point. `` It -LRB- was -RRB- more or less like somebody who had a job to do.'' <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> is charged with six counts of first-degree murder, 28 counts of attempted murder and two counts of kidnapping. Lawyers for <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON>, who could face the death penalty, do not deny he was responsible. But they say he was temporarily insane at the time. The trial was moved inland to this central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> town because of heavy local news coverage. To deflate the insanity claims, prosecutors asked each witness in detail how <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> acted during the shooting, hoping to prove his actions were deliberate. <ORGANIZATION> Publix </ORGANIZATION> store manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brubaker </PERSON>, employee <PERSON> Babetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> and shopper <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> all said the gunman appeared to be in control as he methodically took aim with his semiautomatic rifle at human targets. Mrs. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> and her daughter arrived at the store as <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> sped into the parking lot and got out of his car with what appeared to be a rifle, she testified. Then she saw the gunman shoot two young men who were coming out of the store. As the men crumpled to the ground, the gunman approached them and shot again, Mrs. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` He was holding it up like so and pointing it downward to where they were, she said, crying on the witness stand as she described how the gun was handled. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said he saw two men lying motionless on the ground, and a third man running away yelling in a foreign accent: `` Oh, God. Oh, God.'' The three men were Kuwaiti students. Two died, and the third was seriously wounded.

<HEAD>18 Africans To Leave China, Saying It's Racist</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Eighteen students from <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> say are leaving the country because it is racist and life for them in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has become intolerable. The departures over the next five days would mark the first time African students have left <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> en masse since anti-black racial incidents in four Chinese cities during December and January. Two Senegalese students, contacted this afternoon, said they were happy to be leaving. `` This is my pass to freedom,'' said one man, holding his airplane ticket. `` I've been here 3 -LCB- years but it's felt like a decade.'' The other student, <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ndirye </ORGANIZATION>, said today that he and six other Senegalese students will stay behind to finish the school year and then follow their countrymen home. When they leave, <PERSON> Ndirye </PERSON> said, there will be no more students from <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He said the students were going home because `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is racist.'' `` Everywhere we go they still call us names and rub our skin to see if we will become whiter,'' <PERSON> Ndirye </PERSON> said. `` The situation has become intolerable.'' Two Senegalese diplomats contacted today refused comment. The anti-black incidents began in the eastern city of <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> and Chinese fought on Christmas Eve after Africans tried to bring Chinese girlfriends to a school dance. Chinese later stoned the Africans' dormitory and marched through <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>'s streets, shouting `` Kill the black devils!'' and demanding Africans involved in the fight be punished. One African was held by police for 25 days and two others were detained two weeks. One of them, <PERSON> Alpha </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, left <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Lesser confrontations involving alleged racism against African students occurred in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and two other cities. About 500 Africans students boycotted classes at the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Languages </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. They returned to classes on Feb. 22 after the end of winter vacation. <PERSON> Ndirye </PERSON> said the Senegalise students who are leaving have been living in several cities, including <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, and most were on Chinese government scholarships. He and the other student said they planned to continue their education in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, preferably <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Senegalese speak French. <PERSON> Ndirye </PERSON> praised the government of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> for honoring their requests to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We are different than other African countries,'' he said. `` We are more democratic. If we want to leave a place they respect us.'' African students from countries such as <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> have complained that their governments were not permitting them to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In January, a report by the <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> attacked African embassies for seeming to `` ignore us until things get blown up into crises.'' Senegalese students today said they knew of several Ghanian students who were trying to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But a Ghanian diplomat said his country had yet to decide what to do with the approximately two dozen Ghanian students in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. And at least one student, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON>, the one detained for 25 days in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, said he will stay. In January, <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he was determined to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. About 1,500 African students, most on Chinese scholarships, currently study in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as part of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s policy to cultivate close ties with the Third World. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON>, asked today about the Senegalese, said he had heard nothing of their reported departure. He reiterated <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s position that `` there is not such a question as racial discrimination in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Work crews gathered to dismantle `` Tilted Arc'' just hours after the creator of the steel sculpture ended a last-ditch effort to keep it at a federal office plaza. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>, who has maintained that merely moving the 73-ton work from the site would destroy its artistic integrity, said Wednesday that the removal is `` a very thoughtless and barbaric act.'' `` This country pays lip service to -LRB- Salman -RRB- <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, and turns around and destroys my piece,'' said <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>, referring to the British author who had a price put on his head in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> because of his book `` The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslem leaders labeled blasphemous. Hours earlier, <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Topkis </PERSON>, announced: `` We're dropping all of our efforts to do anything about their destroying Tilted Arc. <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> has been battling in and out of court for the last four years to prevent the government from removing the sculpture from Federal Plaza in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> where it was unveiled in 1981. Workmen were ready to dismantle and remove the 120-foot-long, 12-foot high, wall of curving, rusty steel over the weekend until the government agreed to wait, pending further legal maneuvering by <PERSON> Topkis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Topkis </PERSON> previously sought a delay, to which federal lawyers consented, to research whether the work was protected under the `` moral rights'' clause of a 19th-century international copyright treaty. But he said he concluded that the treaty from the <ORGANIZATION> Berne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> joined two weeks ago, does not bar the government `` from destroying this work of one of our country's most distinguished artists.'' Previously, <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> lost a $ 30 million damage suit against the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which commissioned the work for $ 175,000 in 1979. <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> decided to remove the work after numerous complaints that it was an eyesore that bisected the plaza, preventing its use for large public gatherings, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, regional administrator of the agency. `` This is an important victory for the people of lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, who will now be able to regain the use of the plaza, which has been denied to them for seven years by ` Tilted Arc,''' said Diamond. <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> said the work would be stored under guard at a government parking lot in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> plans an outdoor cafe, trees and other greenery for Federal Plaza, he said. No permanent relocation site for the sculpture has been picked.

 <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, the Lebanese man convicted here of hijacking a plane in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1985, denounced terrorism in an interview broadcast today and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` showing off'' by arresting him. `` I am sorry to say I have been imprisoned because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government would like to show off,'' <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter, said on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> `` Nightwatch'' program. Repeating his courtroom claim that he had been a member of the Amal militia carrying out a military orders, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> said he was not an international terrorist as portrayed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. `` If my brother would harm civilians, I would be against him,'' he said in the interview, which was taped Wednesday night. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was found guilty by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury of hijacking a Royal Jordanian airliner from the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport in 1985 and holding 70 people, two of them Americans, for 30 hours. The jury acquitted him of charges that he used or threatened violence against crew members or passengers and that he helped blow up the aircraft. The hijacked plane was used to deliver to an Arab League meeting in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> Amal's demand that armed Palestinians be removed from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, 30, was lured to arrest in an elaborate trap the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> set on a yacht in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials call his conviction a successful test of a 1984 statute giving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> jurisdiction over the taking of American hostages abroad. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> remains imprisoned under heavy guard and faces a possible sentence of life in prison. But he said he was tried unfairly for taking orders as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia seeking an end to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. `` The leaders of Amal are not terrorists,'' he said. `` They will not terrorize anyone, they will not harm innocent people.'' `` We had an objective. Terrorist acts do not serve ... to end the war. ... Terrorism harms civilians to serve objectives which have nothing to do with the war.'' <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> said he was the wrong target if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aim was to strike against anti-American terrorism. `` But I would like to leave the judgment on this issue to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' he said. `` Had I had any hate or problem with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government, I would have harmed those two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. The testimony proves in court they were well treated. They were even better treated than the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> citizens who were on board that flight.''

 Central American diplomats have reached tentative agreement on a plan that would bring <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops into the region to monitor guerrilla movements. The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> are to meet March 29-30 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> capital, to adopt the plan. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> said adoption would be `` a formality.'' Honduran Ambassador <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials also confirmed Wednesday's agreement in principle Up to 11,000 Nicaraguan Contra rebels supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have bases in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> from which they launch raids into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. They are the prime focus of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the peacekeeping plan does not conflict with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s intention to supply humanitarian aid to the Contras. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Tuesday that an international border patrol force was `` not inconsistent'' with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's policy goals. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers are to operate in the region to verify reports of guerrilla activity and, by their presence, deter such raids. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has drafted a plan calling for up to 100 military observers backed by 60 pilots, drivers and civilian administrators from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Churches won a court victory over the government's electronic war against the Sanctuary movement, but four <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> churches must meet another test to keep their lawsuit alive, a federal appeals court ruled. In a dispute that grew out of the federal government's use of electronic surveillance to track the Sanctuary movement, the court ruled unanimously Wednesday that churches have the right to sue over the issue. `` Of course, we're delighted,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrott </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Southside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` We've always felt that the infiltrators in our church were a disgrace.'' But in order to keep their lawsuit alive, the churches must prove that the surveillance is continuing or likely to resume, according to the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruling. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> must weigh the evidence, the court said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, a lawyer for the churches, called the 3-0 ruling `` a great stride forward toward protecting worship services from electronic surveillance.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> declined to comment. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> district director of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said he had not seen the ruling and could not comment. The court did not say whether government infiltration and secret recording of church services, without a search warrant, would violate freedom of religion or the constitutional ban on unreasonable searches. That is a key issue in the pending appeal of eight Sanctuary movement workers, including five members of the clergy, convicted in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> in 1986 of a variety of immigration charges, including illegally harboring and transporting Central American refugees. It was disclosed in that case that paid government informants had secretly recorded worship services and Bible classes. A federal prosecutor said the surveillance was proper because the church was the site of a criminal conspiracy. The criminal appeal was argued before another panel of the 9th Circuit last December and has not yet been decided. The civil suit that led to Wednesday's ruling was filed by churches in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. They said informants working for the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> attended and secretly recorded their services between March 1984 and January 1985. Once the surveillance was disclosed, church officials said, their attendance declined, a Bible study group was canceled, and members became more reluctant to seek pastoral counseling and less open in their prayers and confessions. The suit sought a ruling that the surveillance was improper and a court order banning it in the future. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> dismissed the suit without a trial, saying that even if all the allegations were true, the churches as organizations had not been harmed. But the appeals court disagreed. `` When congregants are chilled from participating in worship activities, when they refuse to attend worship services because they fear the government is spying on them and taping their every utterance ... we think a church suffers organizational injury because its ability to carry out its ministries has been impaired,'' said the opinion by Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Opposition Boycotts Parliament, Presents Memo To President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition lawmakers stormed out of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s upper house today after its chairman refused to ask the government to release a report that allegedly links a top official to Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s assassination. All but one of the 93 opposition lawmakers in the 245-member chamber decided to boycott the proceedings through Friday to protest <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>'s decision. Some of the 63 opposition members suspended from lower house on Wednesday for demanding disclosure of the report met with President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> and urged him to direct the government to turn the report over to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The government has said the report will remain classified. The demand was first raised on Tuesday after the Indian Express, the country's largest English-language newspaper, published excerpts of the report. The Bombay-based newspaper quoted the inquiry as saying <PERSON> Rajendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s personal secretary, may have `` consciously or unconsciously ... facilitated the commission of a crime.'' <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON>, 52, left the post after the assassination but returned last month as a key aide to <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, the slain leader's son and successor. <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> has refused comment on the allegations, but other government officials have said he is innocent of any wrongdoing. The inquiry, ordered by the government and conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> M.P. <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON>, ran parallel to police investigations into the assassination. It was submitted to the government in 1986. Opposition members in the upper house shouted slogans and pounded on their desks today, demanding the government make the report public. When <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> refused to consider the issue, opposition legislators walked out and said they would not return this week. They then marched to the Presidential Palace and delivered copies of Tuesday's Indian Express to the president and demanded he order the government to release the report The Indian Express, which has a nationwide circulation of 1.1 million, is frequently critical of <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was shot and killed by two Sikh bodyguards on Oct. 31, 1984, as she walked through the garden of her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> residence to a television interview. One of the guards was killed in a shootout with other guards. The other was convicted of murder and hanged Jan. 5, along with a third Sikh who was convicted of conspiracy. In its report, the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said the government report accused <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> of altering the time of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s appointment with the television crew and that <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON>, who was walking with Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, fell back `` in the nick of time as they were approaching the scene of the assassination.'' The government has said Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was killed in revenge for an army raid she ordered in June 1984 on the Golden Temple, the Sikhs' holiest shrine

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is being asked to back up his presidential campaign rhetoric blasting Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for failing to clean up <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, for whom the polluted harbor became a political liability, asked the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Wednesday to put `` its money where its mouth was.'' `` When you make the kind of statements that were made in the campaign, you've got an obligation to make good on them,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The governor faulted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for proposing cutbacks in federal wastewater construction programs that would cost <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> $ 40 million. In addition, he charged that while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has earmarked $ 59 million for the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> project, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has not included those funds in its budget. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was confident the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> congressional delegation would reverse those decisions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president, staged a surprise cruise in September on <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> to criticize <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for pollution. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters argued that the governor was primarily responsible for the legislation designed to end the pollution by the next century. But the charges, reinforced by a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign TV commercial, stuck to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, leaving the Democrat on the defensive. `` I'm proud to say that as of today, we're right on schedule _ and that's the way we're going to keep it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday, flanked by Environmental Affairs Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVillars </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>. The governor ticked off a series of steps already taken to address the harbor pollution, beginning with the creation of the water resources authority. Noting that the agency has already spent $ 350 million of the projected $ 6.5 billion cost, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the state water authority has stopped the discharge of `` floating scum'' from its aging treatment plants at <LOCATION> Nut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Deer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised that families will notice cleaner beaches this summer in the metropolitan area.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ante </PERSON> <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> was installed today as premier and promised a series of democratic-oriented economic and political initiatives to roust this Communist country from a nine-year economic slide. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> said in his inaugural speech that a free-market economy is the `` ultimate achievement of mankind _ for which no alternative has yet been found.'' A new Cabinet was also sworn in. `` There is no solution to the economic crisis without the strengthening of political democracy in the country,'' he said, urging the creation of `` a new modern socialist system.'' The new premier said this <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> country of 23 million people has to undergo `` a fundamental change'' in order to revive the economy. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is burdened by 346 percent annual inflation and a $ 21 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> indicated he would seek closer links the West, including greater economic cooperation with the European Economic Community. He advocates reshaping the country's banking system along Western lines, creating a stock market and ending state subsidies to money-losing companies. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, which split from the Soviet bloc in 1948, is a founding member of the non-aligned movement, and both superpowers vie for its good graces. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>, a successful businessman, called for an immediate introduction of shares and bonds, private initiative and entrepreneurship and an end to state interference in the operation of businesses. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>, a former president of the Croatian republic, succeeds <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>, who, together with his entire <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, resigned Dec. 30. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>'s government was the first to resign since the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> took power after World War II. He stepped down following his government's failure to solve the country's daunting social and economic problems, including a dramatic rise in social and ethnic unrest. Economic problems have been accompanied by a resurgence of historic ethnic rivalries a this loose federation of six republics and two autonomous provinces. Much of the recent unrest has centered on the southern province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where ethnic Albanians form a majority of 90 percent. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>'s 19-member Cabinet, the smallest in postwar history, is a mix of prominent politicians and technocrats, with only two ministers retaining the seats they occupied in <LOCATION> Mikulic </LOCATION>'s government. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Budimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Loncar </PERSON> and Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Veljko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadijevic </PERSON> remained in the new administration, while <PERSON> Dobrosav </PERSON> <PERSON> Culafic </PERSON>, Interior Minister in <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>'s government, lost his job. <PERSON> Culafic </PERSON> was replaced following severe public criticism of his handling of tensions in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where emergency measures were imposed last month in order to prevent clashes between ethnic Albanians and Slavs living there. The important <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> went to Gen. <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gracanin </PERSON>, president of the largest republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, of which <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is an administrative part. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> named as vice premiers <PERSON> Aleksandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitrovic </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s vice president, and <PERSON> Zivko </PERSON> <PERSON> Pregl </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Slovene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party The choice of vice premiers indicates <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> took a balanced stand between <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, which advocates a market economy and more political pluralism, and <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, which strives for more centralism and political orthodoxy. In his choice of <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members, <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> has for the first time abandoned the principle of absolute parity among the republics and autonomous provinces _ which, strictly adhered to in the past, provided for equal <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> representation of all regions. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is run by a state presidency, a collective nine-man body whose chairmanship rotates annually. It is the supreme commander of the armed forces and executes foreign policy. The government is responsible for executing economic policy, while the Communist Party Presidium, or Politburo, has 23 members to oversee state activities.

<TEXT>
 The Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are vying furiously to gain credit for helping <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families afford satisfactory child care. The White House rushed a long-promised child-care bill to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Wednesday as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and Human Resources approved, by an 11-5 margin, a rival $ 2.5 billion program of direct subsidies. Only those families making $ 13,000 or less would be eligible for assistance under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan; the congressional proposal's income ceiling would be each state's median income. The national median for a family of four is $ 32,777. `` It's not a question of whether or not we're going to do something on child care this year, but the direction it's going to take,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coates </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel worked toward approval of the measure drafted by Sen. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., and co-sponsored by about 40 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, including a handful of The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal, outlined by press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, would provide a tax credit of up to $ 1,000 for each child under age 4 in working families who make up to $ 13,000 a year. He said 2.5 million American families would initially benefit from the legislation. Such families would be given credit toward the first 14 percent of the income they report for tax liability purposes. This would mean that people in the lowest, minimum-wage categories of less than $ 8,000 a year would get less of a benefit than those at the upper end of the scale. Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., today called the administration's approach a `` 2 percent solution'' that should be part of the more ambitious Democratic approach `` I think we'll probably end up with both,'' she said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America. `` One -LRB- the Republican bill -RRB- is a child allowance bill, and that's fine. ... But it does n't deal with child care.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was questioned aggressively at the midday news briefing about the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration formula. `` You can always pick some number and say, ` Is this enough, or is this too little?''' he said. `` But the fact is, you need to start someplace. It reflects budget considerations _ that we ca n't afford unlimited costs here and obviously if you could pick any number you wanted to, and you had unlimited billions to spend, you'd rather pick a much higher figure, but you do the best you can with what you've got.'' During his presidential campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly cited child-care assistance for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families as one of his top priorities. Under existing law, parents are allowed a $ 720 credit for child care costs incurred in order to accept or keep employment, but it applies only to families with sufficient income to pay federal income taxes. Under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan, if a family's income tax liability was less than $ 1,000, it would get a refund reflecting the difference between the amount owed and the $ 1,000 credit. The Dodd bill, similar to a measure that reached the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor last year but was blocked by an informal filibuster, would provide benefits to families with children up to age 15 whose income does not exceed the median income in the state where they live. Aside from the scope and cost of the programs, a major difference is that the Dodd bill would set up minimum federal standards for day care providers _ although states would be given more than six years to comply _ while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> measure would leave standards solely to the states, as they are now. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said emphatically in a statement that he opposed having the federal government get into the business of regulating the quality of child care. `` Federal policy should increase, not decrease, the range of choices available to parents,'' he said. `` The federal government should not become involved in licensing decisions and federal financial support should not be made contingent upon state licensing decisions.'' At a news conference, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> welcomed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s determination to push for child care assistance but ridiculed some aspects of the president's proposal as `` utterly amazing.'' `` I'm opposed to any suggestion this is a substitute somehow for a meaningful child care bill,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. He said the administration's bill would cover less than 2 percent of the population. While <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> gave no estimate of what the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed tax credits might cost the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> and others have said it would be minimal _ probably just a few million dollars. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged that Democrats had their own bill and said that was `` one of the reasons why we wanted to get on ... as soon as possible'' with the administration version. `` It's a matter where there is a direct philosophical difference between Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, and one that will be argued probably along those lines in some cases,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` But it's also a debate I think everybody wants to have because both sides of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recognize there is a need and a desire to do something.''

<HEAD>Caller Claims Responsibility For Van Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> says it is checking into claims by a radio station caller that a group called Guardians of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> planted the bomb that destroyed a van driven by the wife of the USS Vincennes skipper. Meanwhile, trustees at the private school where the skipper's wife teaches scheduled an emergency meeting today in response to parents' concern about student safety if <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> returns to her fourth-grade classroom The caller, who spoke with a <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> accent and claimed to be a member of the group, linked Friday's car bombing to last July's downing of an Iranian jetliner by a missile fired from the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, the radio station said All 290 people aboard of the jet were killed when Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> gave the order to fire in the belief the aircraft was an attacking warplane. The caller to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> KNX </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday also threatened additional attacks against <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' wife and `` all the American officers and officials,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON>, the station's executive news producer `` We're looking into -LRB- the claim -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He declined to elaborate. Terrorist expert <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said he doubts the validity of the call because it came five days after the bombing and was n't phoned to a news wire service like most legitimate claims for such acts. Guardians of the Islamic Revolution has told international news organizations it was responsible for the Dec. 21 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, that killed 270 people. The Islamic group also has claimed credit for a July 1987 car bombing in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> that killed a former minister in the government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deposed <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, and the October 1987 slayings of two opponents of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> escaped uninjured in Friday's bombing of the family van. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said the bomb was a non-military device, possibly a pipe bomb. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Orrantia </PERSON> has said no possible motives for the attack on the van have been ruled out, including retribution for the airliner downing. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' future at La Jolla Country Day School may be discussed at today's board of trustees meeting, which was called after the school received a bomb threat Tuesday, board member <PERSON> Houshmand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aftahi </PERSON> said. Police found no explosives, but the incident apparently caused concern among parents that such threats will continue if Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> returns to the school, where students will be off the next two weeks for spring break. `` I hear that some parents are concerned and they want to know what the school is going to do about it,'' <PERSON> Aftahi </PERSON> said. `` We're all concerned about the security of our children, and we feel that her presence on the campus, at this point, is not good,'' an unidentified parent told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think parents would prefer that she stay away for the rest of the school year.''

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said today that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> fundraising efforts to benefit the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement have raised doubts about the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s impartiality in monitoring the Namibian independence process. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has been soliciting funds for the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, set for March 21, said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s director general of foreign affairs.

Last year, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan that calls for the independence process to begin April 1, leading to elections in November. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is favored in the elections, but other political parties will be competing. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON> said there would be `` hell to pay'' when these parties learn that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> was raising money that would benefit <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON> also accused <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> of inflating the number of its supporters living as refugees outside <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has said there are 80,000 refugees, while the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> has put the figure at around 60,000, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has suggested there might be as few as 15,000. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> receives funds from various countries and organizations on a per capita basis.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> fought to hang onto his job in a dramatic personal appeal on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor and then sat in silence as lawmakers denounced him for `` inexcusable breaches of the public trust.'' Standing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> declared Wednesday he had been acquitted by a jury in 1983 of charges of plotting to get a $ 150,000 bribe and said `` five years of post-acquittal investigation has produced no new evidence.'' `` I proclaimed my innocence then as I have from the outset and as I do now,'' said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, the first black federal judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> history. Nearby sat Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, who resigned as a federal judge to come to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, his expression alert but noncommittal. A few desks away, Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., former chief justice of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, thumbed through law books and leaned forward from time to time to gaze at <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> planned a closed-door session today to consider the appeal from <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, for dismissal of all but one of the 17 articles of impeachment approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 413-3 on Aug. 3. In an impeachment trial, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members serve as the prosecutors and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acts as the judge and jury. A decision to go ahead with the impeachment trial would move the proceedings to a special committee for hearing evidence, followed by a floor vote on whether to convict <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of conspiracy, perjury and disclosing secret wiretap information in an investigation of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> corruption. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, 52, would remain free if convicted but would lose his seat on the federal bench and his $ 89,500 annual salary. Packed galleries were ordered by Sergeant-at-Arms <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> to `` keep silent on pain of imprisonment'' as <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> took the floor to address an extraordinary <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> session with attendance among lawmakers unusually high. `` The jury heard all the evidence and argument on both sides,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said. `` They were attentive. The prosecutors never complained about either the quality of the jurors or the attention they gave. Those jurors deliberated carefully. They reached a conclusion. All 12 of them agreed that I was not guilty.'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, one of the prosecutors, scoffed at <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' position. He said a double-jeopardy defense did not apply in an impeachment trial but that the judge was seizing on it anyway `` to shield himself from the consequences of his inexcusable breaches of the public trust.'' `` Over five years, Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> engaged in a clearly discernible pattern of misbehavior,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. `` He conspired to sell his public office for personal gain, he subverted our judicial process by repeatedly lying under oath and he divulged confidential information in violation of his own court order,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> while <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> sat silently at the defense table with his attorneys. `` Today, Judge <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> asks you to ignore his corrupt conduct,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. `` In doing so, he asks you to rely on a tainted jury verdict.'' In addition to asserting the double jeopardy defense, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> says he can not get a fair trial because of numerous delays between the 1983 criminal trial and now. House members say the judge himself caused 18 months of delays by fighting a rearguard action to prevent lawmakers from getting their hands on evidence. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, a 1979 appointee to the federal bench, was arrested the night of Oct. 8, 1981, in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, hours after a close friend, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON>, was caught with a garment bag containing $ 125,000 in cash that he had received from an undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. The undercover agent had been posing as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, one of two brothers already under a three-year sentence from <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> after being convicted of skimming from a Teamsters pension fund loan. The Romano brothers, who have since died, had balked when approached about paying a bribe in exchange for a better sentence. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, which had been investigating Borders, set up a sting operation with the undercover man masquerading as <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>. Borders, at the time a politically influential <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> criminal lawyer, was convicted of promising that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> would change the prison time to probation in exchange for the $ 150,000 payoff. He was sentenced to five years and went to prison after his appeals failed. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a testimonial dinner for Borders the day the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> sprang its trap. Informed that agents wanted to question him, he left his suite in the plush L'Enfant Plaza Hotel without packing or checking out and told a friend he was taking a cab to <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, four miles away. Instead, he traveled more than 30 miles to <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and caught a flight to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> but deplaned in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and rented a car to drive to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. His own auto at the time was parked at the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> airport.

<TEXT>
 Moslem guerrillas today claimed they shot down two more aircraft in heavy fighting in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and captured two helicopters from Afghan soldiers who deserted. The claim brought to seven the number of communist aircraft the insurgents say they have destroyed this week in fierce fighting for the strategic city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 40 miles west of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. There was no immediate comment from Afghan government, and it was not possible to confirm the claims. Reports from the Afghan capital indicate <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has resumed an airlift of military supplies to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in response to the 10-day <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> offensive, which has had some of the heaviest fighting of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s civil war. The lastest reports indicate that Afghan soldiers withstood the guerrilla offensive on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and that the fighting has reached a stalemate. No reliable casualty figures are available but estimates run in hundreds of dead and thousands of wounded on both sides. It is the first major showdown between government troops and the guerrillas since Soviet forces ended nine years of military involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15. The guerrillas have fought the government since 1978 to establish an Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Observers believe a guerrilla victory at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, a key city along the main highway from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, could lead to the fall of the capital, 75 miles to the west. The guerrilla-run <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said insurgents downed a helicopter gunship near <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>'s television station and an airplane outside the city on Wednesday. A spokesman for the guerrilla <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, who demanded anonymity, reported crews of two helicopter gunships surrendered their craft to guerrillas outside the western city of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The guerrillas claim they overran <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>'s most important garrison, <PERSON> Samarkhel </PERSON> to the east of the city, and were closing in on the airport. But Afghan soldiers have retaliated with unexpectedly aggressive aerial and artillery bombardments which reportedly have stalled the rebels' progress. Fighting now centers on suburbs north, west and south of the city, according to reports reaching <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> today. `` The regime militas have been offering stiff resistance to -LRB- guerrilla -RRB- advances,'' said <PERSON> Ijaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilani </PERSON>, a Pakistani who monitors the war for the semi-private <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. Leaders of the <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> - and U.S.-supported guerrillas have predicted an early collapse of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government in the absence of its Soviet backers, but Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has insisted his forces are strong enough to survive <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that over the previous 24 hours, 560 guerrillas and supporters were killed and 252 were wounded. It said the dead included four Americans, a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> national, and some Pakistanis. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> back the Moslem guerrillas in their war with the communist government but deny having any nationals fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Despite communist claims, guerrilla sources say they have lost only about 150 men in the offensive and captured more than 700 government troops.

 Discovery's astronauts, working again at full electrical power, received a call from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and focused cameras on the wounds inflicted on Earth by man's pollution and nature's violence. Flying upside down 180 miles high, the five-man crew captured thousands of views of Earth with television, movie and still cameras. Some of the film will be edited into a study of ecological trouble spots. The president and the crew talked briefly in a combined television-telephone hookup that let <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> see the astronauts in their space cabin from the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> congratulated them on their flight _ which nearly had to be cut short one day because of an electrical-system problem _ and said, `` I am determined to go forward with an active space program.'' When Discovery commander <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> revealed that the crew was `` flying something for the new first lady'' it prompted a presidential invitation. `` You better come up here and give it to her personally,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` You're invited. When you get back head this way.'' Asked about a camera used to photograph environmental targets, pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> said the crew was `` getting a lot of great film that will show a lot of people around the world how fragile the planet <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is in this big vastness of space.'' `` There is so much interest today on the global environment,'' replied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I think a lot of people will see from just your important mission the contribution that space exploration can make to the world's environment.'' Discovery's crew started the day by pre-empting the usual wake-up call from <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> with tape recordings of their own. They ended their eight-hour sleep by radioing to Earth the theme music from `` Star Trek.'' Then, the recorded voice of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON>, who played Capt. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> in `` Star Trek,'' sent congratulations to <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` Discovery,'' responded a Mission Control communicator, `` tell <PERSON> Scotty </PERSON> to beam me up.'' A rousing medley of school songs from the alma maters of the crew members was the official wake up sound from <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The tape included `` Anchor's Aweigh'' for <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> graduates <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>; `` Wild Blue Yonder'' for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> graduate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fight song for Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON>, a physican who earned a bachelor's degree from the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> school. Their fourth day in orbit was the first with a trouble-free electrical power supply system. On Wednesday, they followed special operating instructions from <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> to correct an erratic flow from a hydrogen tank that supplies reactant to chemical power generators on the shuttle. Flow from the tank became troublesome shortly after Discovery was launched Monday and <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> feared that fuel from the tank would not be available for use. Engineers asked the astronauts to dim lights and turn off computers, and said the five-day mission could be cut short a day if the problem was n't corrected. The fuel cells on the shuttle combine hydrogen and oxygen to make electricity and pure water. Discovery became an orbiting movie studio for part of today. The astronauts were using a 70mm camera to take high fidelity pictures of environmental targets on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> for a joint project of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Photo targets included a coral reef being destroyed by pollution off east <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the scars left by fires in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> and the forests of the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, areas of deforestation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> and an active volcano in <LOCATION> Guatamala </LOCATION>. `` We got plenty of shots of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON> reported. `` And we got some very good pictures of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>.'' The astronauts also aimed cameras at <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> volcanos, the Great Barrier Reef off <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Aswan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> portion of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Mission Control remotely operated television cameras on Discovery to capture startling views of lightning playing across the skies over <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. From the Discovery's camera perch, the lightning could be seen bursting like a string of flashing white lights on a Christmas tree. Earlier studies from space have shown that lightning bolts seem to trigger each other in sequence along the front of a moving thunderstorm. The astronauts also tended to their strange collection of orbiting companions _ four crippled rats, 32 fertilized chicken eggs and a miniature plot of plants _ that are among the experiments aboard. Four caged rats with intentionally injured bones are being flown to test how weightlessness can affect healing. The chicken eggs will be examined after Discovery lands to determine how weightlessness affect the embryo development and a similar study is being made on the roots of a group of plants growing in a box on board. The flight is the first of the year and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> hopes to have six more as the agency builds toward a planned one-a-month flight rate within two years. The mission is third since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights resumed following the 1986 accident that destroyed space shuttle Challenger and killed seven astronauts. The astronauts accomplished the main goal on its first day of the flight _ deploying a $ 100 million communications satellite. The satellite is in a high orbit where it completes a network <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will use to link communications with shuttles and other satellites. The mission is scheduled to end Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Trustees of <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> have expressed concern that the institution's administration may be incapable of resolving pressing problems and agreed to closely monitor top administrators, it was reported today. Board members also told administrators Wednesday they hold them responsible for student demonstrations at the predominantly black university that subsided only after the intervention of Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and civil rights leader <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, chairman of the board of trustees, told reporters that in a board meeting with President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON> and others, `` We expressed our expectation that the administration will manage this institution as efficiently and effectively as possible and correct the inadequacies that exist. The board wants to make sure we do n't get a recurrence -LRB- of the demonstrations -RRB- in the future. The Poat quoted one unidentified trustee as saying: `` There is a deep concern on the part of the trustees that our recent troubles are a result of the fact that there is no one at the helm. We will be meeting over the next two to three months to determine if there is any way to address <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s problems with the present -LRB- leadership -RRB- team.'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Estep </PERSON>, vice president for university relations who has been acting as spokesman for the administration, said he could not comment on the criticisms raised about Cheek or his deputies. For more than three days last week, 3,000 students, about one-fourth of the student body, occupied the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> administration building to protest the appointment of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> to the board of trustees. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s nomination, while made by another trustee, was wholeheartedly supported by <ORGANIZATION> Cheek </ORGANIZATION>, who has been president of the federally subsidized university since 1968. Students said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s management of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election campaign had had racist overtones, and that his appointment showed how insensitive university administrators are to their concerns. They demanded and received <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s resignation. They also got assurances that the school would consider an African-American graduate studies program, and work on severe housing inadequacies, speedier processing of financial aid and security improvements.

 Christians and Moslems battled with artillery across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, and Moslems staged a nationwide strike to mourn victims of the worst round of civil war fighting in four years. Police said Moslem gunners fired rockets from west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seaside <LOCATION> Zeitouni </LOCATION> district into the Christian-controlled <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> port, damaging installations but causing no casualties In retaliation, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> batteries fired on the Moslem residential districts of <LOCATION> Sabra </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kasskass </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, a police spokesman said. There were no immediate reports of casualties, according to the police spokesman, who requested anonymity. Loudspeaker vans toured west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after the bombardment, urging people to remain indoors. Sniper fire crackled in the old commercial district straddling the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> harbor and around the Christian-held town of <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El-Gharb </LOCATION>, southeast of the capital, police said. The two locations were the main battlefronts in the past eight days of fighting that left 49 people dead and 161 wounded, by police count. The clashes occurred between Christian units of army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and Syrian-backed militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The fighting began after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> on March 6 imposed an air-and-sea blockade on illegal harbors run by Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in a bid to choke off their main source of revenue. The blockade angered <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, whose party runs two illegal port facilities south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, whose Amal militia operates one port in south beirut. The militias use the ports to bring in weapons and supplies as well as imported goods sold in areas under their control. As a result, the state treasury loses an estimated $ 100 million a year in customs duties. The one-day strike in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and other Moslem areas was called by <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and his Moslem and leftist allies `` in mourning for the victims of the massacre committed by Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>.'' Most casualties in the latest round of the 14-year-old civil war were victims of a 24-hour shelling duel in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Monday and Tuesday. Schools, shops, cafes, restaurants, banks and other businesses were closed in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in response to <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s call for a work stoppage. The police spokesman said Moslems in cities in north, east and south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> also joined the strike. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military Cabinet that has been vying for legitimacy with a rival <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> under acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> since President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term ended Sept. 22. Minutes before stepping down, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to head an interim military Cabinet, but his appointment was rejected by leftists and Moslems who declared allegiance to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 53, accused Syrian peacekeeping troops stationed in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> of causing the two-day bombardment. He declared that his 20,000 regular troops were involved in a `` war of liberation'' against Syrian occupation forces. The Syrians, with 40,000 troops deployed in predominantly Moslem sectors of the country, are <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main power brokers and support <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' cabinet. In <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Al-Baath </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper, which is controlled by President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s ruling party, denied <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s charges and said they were aimed at `` devastating <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s constructive role in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.''

 Supreme Court Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> is being criticized for sending a letter used by conservative <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> to support their claim that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` a Christian nation.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>, president of People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, said the letter has lent support to a movement that is `` a force for religious intolerance.'' The liberal activist group supports strict separation of church and state. <PERSON> O'Connnor </PERSON> said in a brief statement Wednesday that she was sorry the way her letter was used. `` I regret that a letter I sent to an acquaintance in response to her request for information was used in a political debate,'' said <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, a former state legislator from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. `` It was not my intention to express a personal view about the subject of the inquiry, but merely to attempt to respond appropriately to one of the many requests for information which come across my desk.'' She declined further comment. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s May 19, 1988 letter was sent to <PERSON> Annetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Conant </PERSON>, author of a resolution characterizing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> nation that was adopted last January by the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The resolution is a rallying point for backers of the state's former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governor, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was removed from office last year Moderate Republicans and prominent Jewish Republicans in the state expressed dismay over the resolution. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said in her letter to Ms. <PERSON> Conant </PERSON>, `` You wrote me recently to inquire about any holdings of this court to the effect that this is a Christian nation. There are statements to such effect in the following opinions.'' The letter cited three high court rulings. In one, handed down in 1892, the court said, `` We are a Christian people and the morality of the country is deeply engrafted upon Christianity.'' But two more recent opinions do not refer to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a a Christian nation in the pages cited by <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> is back on death row after a fellow inmate persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> against <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' wishes to block his execution this morning for the slayings of 14 family members. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 48, had been scheduled to die by injection five weeks after he was convicted of the 1987 Christmastime killings. He has said he wants to die and refused to appeal. The order to stop the execution was issued Wednesday without dissent or comment. `` We're disappointed because we know our client will be disappointed,'' said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who had met with his client Wednesday afternoon. `` I personally felt that would be the last time I talked to him.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who was eating his last meal when he saw a TV report about the stay, merely asked if he could finish the meal. <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON>, who is appealing his 1987 death penalty and conviction, had filed the petition, contending that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' execution _ which would have been the first in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> in a quarter-century _ could have repercussions for other death row inmates <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON>'s attorney, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution requires an appeal in all death cases. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Friday that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> is competent to waive his appeal for the February conviction. The same court on Monday rejected <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON>'s petition, claiming he lacked legal standing. <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON> filed the petition with Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> on Tuesday and <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> referred it to the full court on Wednesday. Reaction from state and local officials came swiftly. `` The ruling came as a complete shock to me and I do n't understand it,'' Gov <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Very, very surprised, frustrated,'' was state Attorney General <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s response. `` I actually did n't think the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would issue a stay.'' In <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was arrested on Dec. 28, 1987, after killing two residents in a shooting rampage, the opinion voiced against the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling was stronger. `` The decison stinks,'' Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has let <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON>, a convicted murderer, manipulate the judicial system and it's just not right.'' After <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>, authorities discovered the bodies of his wife, seven children, two of the children's spouses and four grandchildren at his home near <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, about 75 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> has prosecuted <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> twice, winning a death sentence each time. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was first sentenced to death last year for the <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> murders. That execution was postponed by state and federal courts considering the validity of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' waiver of his right to appeal. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said Wednesday he would now set a death date for <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> in the conviction for the <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> murders. But <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said he would expect the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to stay any execution date for <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> while it considers the <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON> petition. The stay is of indefinite duration, pending the filing of a petition to the court asking it to review <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' case. If the petition is denied by the court _ at least four of the nine justices would have to vote to grant it _ the stay would be dissolved automatically and <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> could sign a death warrant for <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> for the family murders. The <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Democrat, a <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> newspaper, published a letter Wednesday from <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> in which <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>' death penalty ineffective `` One of the things I wanted to say in court -LRB- which would have answered one of your questions -RRB- is that <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> does not have a meaningful death penalty, it is a facade,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> wrote in response to questions contained in a note given to him after a March 9 federal court hearing.

<TEXT>
 Radio signals beamed by a government agency are jamming hundreds of automatic garage door openers in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. And the government says homeowners will just have to tough it out and lift their garage doors themselves through May 2. Garage door companies have been swamped with complaints since Friday, when residents discovered nothing happened when they tried to use the remote-control devices. It's `` the worst problem I've seen in my 11 years in the business,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brotherson </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Walnut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Door </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has received 40 to 60 calls a day about the interference. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hora </PERSON>, a spokesman with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, on Tuesday declined to identify the agency that has been transmitting radio signals from atop Mount Diablo. But he warned that residents who ca n't turn the openers to another frequency can expect the problem to persist through May 2. The problem has been reported in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orinda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moraga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>. Garage door openers operate on radio frequencies used by the government and others with authorization. <PERSON> Hora </PERSON> said the public was n't warned about the problem because openers are considered `` unprotected devices.'' `` We're not obligated to do anything,'' he said. `` Normally, though, if anyone were to contact us, we would let them know what the situation is.''

 A soldier who was ordered to report to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and leave her infant daughter behind has won a delay of the transfer but said today she still wants out of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has nothing to do with going to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, really,'' Spec. 4 <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Beekman </PERSON>, 21, said in an interview. `` I have a hard time being in the military with a child.'' Ms. <PERSON> Beekman </PERSON> sued on Tuesday seeking a discharge and an injunction blocking <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> orders that she report to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on March 23. Ms. <PERSON> Beekman </PERSON>, whose child is 6 months old, was told no dependents were allowed on the assignment. The Army decided Wednesday to halt her transfer pending the outcome of the federal court case, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Eustis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION>, where Ms. <PERSON> Beekman </PERSON> is stationed. `` If the court rules that everything that was done was legal, then we have no alternative but to send her,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Beekman </PERSON>, a graphics illustrator, joined the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for a four-year hitch in 1986. When she became pregnant, Ms. <PERSON> Beekman </PERSON> was given the opportunity under military law to request a discharge, but she turned one down. However, after she gave birth in September and her husband, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, left <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in October to take a job in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, she found the dual role of mother and soldier too much too handle, she said in court papers. `` I am just barely able to get myself up in the morning and am tired all day at work,'' she said. An Army chaplain, two comanding officers and an Army staff judge supported Ms. <PERSON> Beekman </PERSON>'s request for a discharge to avert the transfer, but Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON>, her group commander, overruled their recommendations. Her attorney, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Labowitz </PERSON>, said he had found no previous cases in which a military woman has gone to court seeking a discharge so she could be with her child. `` They have greatly liberalized the rules regarding women in the military generally,'' he said. `` But having opened up that situation, that just creates new conflicts like this one.''

<TEXT>
 Israeli troops today destroyed or sealed four homes owned by Palestinians linked to a guerrilla group and reportedly opened fire on Palestinian youths who threw stones in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Throughout the narrow coastal strip, Palestinian youths burned tires, raised outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and hurled rocks at troops, who responded with gunfire, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. There were no reports of casualties. Protests by stone-throwing Palestinian school children prompted <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities to close two Palestinian junior high schools in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the nearby village of <PERSON> Bani </PERSON> <PERSON> Suheila </PERSON>, reports said. Palestinian witnesses said troops used dynamite to blow up two homes in the Rimal and <LOCATION> Tufah </LOCATION> neighborhoods of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after imposing curfews and ordering family members to remove their belongings. The homes were owned by two brothers who were arrested earlier this month for allegedly belonging to a guerrilla squad linked to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the army said. The squad is accused of killing two Palestinians suspected of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. `` This house belonged to my husband's 75-year-old father,'' <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Abukhari </PERSON> said. `` My six children and I are now homeless.'' Troops also sealed the homes of two other alleged squad members, the army said. In the Jabaliya refugee camp, troops late Wednesday bulldozed the home of a Palestinian lawyer wanted by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities for allegedly heading <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islami </ORGANIZATION>, a fundamentalist Moslem group backed by <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the army said. The timing of the demolition appeared linked to an attempted infiltration from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> on Wednesday by two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers who said they belonged to Jihad Islami and were operating with the backing of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>. Since the December 1987 start of the uprising, the army has destroyed or sealed nearly 200 houses belonging to Palestinians suspected of anti-Israeli violence. Usually, the houses are demolished or sealed before a suspect stands trial. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has condemned the practice, saying it violates the right to due process before the law.

 Three homicides within six hours raised the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s homicide toll to a record pace of 110 for the year, authorities said today. The deaths were the first fatal shootings here in at least 91 hours, police said, and compared with 67 homicides at this time last year. The names of the victims were not released. The first victim died Wednesday night in what police described as an execution-style slaying in the northwest section. The second victim was shot four times between two buildings at an apartment complex in the city's southeast quadrant, according to neighbors and police. The victim was pronounced dead at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> a short time later. A nursing supervisor said, `` He was riddled with bullets.'' The third shooting death occurred early today in northeast <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when a man was found dead in a four-wheel-drive truck, a vehicle that police say is popular with drug dealers. Police said they have no suspects or motives for the deaths, but most previous homicides had been linked to the drug trade. The fatal shootings late Wednesday and early today were the first since four men were killed within six hours Friday night.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> secretly alerted airlines and airports about a possible terrorist attack two days before a bomb blew <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 out of the sky over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has announced. It said in a statement Wednesday night the alert gave precise details of a new type of bomb, hidden in a radio-cassette player, similar to the device that on Dec. 21 destroyed Flight 103, killing all 259 people aboard the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. The alert was similar to an earlier warning sent out on Nov. 22, but included a photo of the radio-cassette player, the department said later. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, then changed planes at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport before heading for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A radio-cassette player containing plastic explosives and a device that could be set to detonate the bomb at a given altitude was found in October during raids by West German authorities in which 13 alleged members of the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group were arrested. <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said today: `` There is indeed a memo dated Dec. 19, but we did not receive it until Jan. 17. I am not going to say more than that.'' She said she did not have the memo in front of her so she would not talk about what it contained. <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was advised by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 18 of a bomb device found in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and was told the same thing by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 16, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s international division <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> today said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that `` people are reading an awful lot of things into'' the fact that some airlines received the information from the Departnent of Transport on Jan. 16. `` We had received the same information from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> a month earlier,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the airline received a telex on Nov. 22, `` the day it was sent'' but refused to go into details of what it said. He also said the airline received an alert on Dec. 19. `` We had full details, which we passed onto security staff,'' he said. He declined to be named. Lawmaker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman on transport, accused the government of mounting `` what can only be a cover-up.'' Two Americans who lost family members aboard Flight 103 today said the plane should have been searched for a bomb before it left for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the alert from its principal aviation security adviser, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, followed an initial warning in November of a possible bombing. It said: `` The barometric timing device indicated it was intended to sabotage an aircraft. We sent advice to the relevant security authorities. They were told what to look for. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities would have done the same for American airlines.'' Asked why <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> had not mentioned the Dec. 19 warning after the bombing, a department spokesman, who in accordance with British practice declined to be further identified, said: `` These are things that Mr. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> may want to answer on in due course. He said an initial warning was sent on Nov. 22, or 17 days before a Dec. 9 warning by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence sources that a group planned to bomb a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> within two weeks. The spokesman said some members of the group arrested in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were still being detained while investigations continued into the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> bombing. `` The case of the terrorist group in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> is being looked at in relation to <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>,'' he said. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tabloid the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> today called the latest disclosure `` a huge embarrassment'' to <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who have come under pressure `` from anguished relatives and members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to disclose how much the government knew.'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> man whose 20-year-old daughter <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> was killed aboard the plane, said the plane should have been searched for a bomb. `` It's unconscionable. This plane should have never left the ground until it was thoroughly checked,'' he said in an telephone interview. <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Buser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> WCBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>: `` How the hell am I supposed to feel if they knew this -LRB- the bomb -RRB- was going to be there.'' Ms. <PERSON> Buser </PERSON>, who lost her husband, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>; son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>; and daughter <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, said: `` If it's going to save a planeload of people and you have a report that this thing might happen, it's worth -LRB- waiting -RRB- two hours.

 Motorists in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> will soon be offered a window decal allowing police to stop their car after hours to see if it is stolen. Under a plan Police Chief <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON> is expected to reveal Thursday, the sticker will be made available for free to interested motorists and will alert police that the car should not be on the street in the early morning. Under the law, police can not normally stop a car without `` probable cause'' to believe a crime has been committed. More than 24,000 cars, worth $ 130.4 million, were stolen last year in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, a 22 percent increase over 1987. During January and February of 1989, the auto theft rate was 38 percent higher than the same months in 1988, police said. The stickers will serve as both a deterrent to auto theft and a tool to catch thieves in the act, said Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifelbein </PERSON>. Lt. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of the department's auto theft division said the decals will be designed like inspection stickers so they ca n't be peeled off. `` A good auto thief wo n't want to take five minutes scraping off a sticker so he can steal a car,'' he said.

 Guerrillas paralyzed bus services, sabotaged power lines and staged sporadic attacks today in a stepped-up campaign to disrupt Sunday's presidential election. Most bus drivers refused to work because rebels warned bus companies to keep their vehicles off the nation's streets and gas stations to remain closed. Many gas stations were guarded by troops to prevent rebel attacks. `` It does not matter that we have the soldiers here. We ca n't work because the workers have not come in,'' a watchman at one gas station said Much of the capital and the eastern half of the country was without power after rebels destroyed electricity poles, the power company said. Schools were closed throughout <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, while army helicopters and planes flew over the capital. One soldier was killed and four were wounded during a pre-dawn guerrilla attack in <LOCATION> Entre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rios </LOCATION>, 40 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the military said. The <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella group for the leftist guerrillas, also launched morning attacks in the towns of <LOCATION> Cinquera </LOCATION> and Tejutepeque in the eastern department of <LOCATION> Cabanas </LOCATION> and in the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>, officials said. No casualties were immediately reported. In the capital, an army convoy waited outside the eastern bus terminal to transport passengers to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vicente </LOCATION>, 30 miles to the east, but few customers were seen early this morning. `` No one has come in. The owners are afraid. So are the people,'' said dispatcher <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s western bus terminal. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said there normally are 300 bus departures and arrivals daily. The rebels have called for an election boycott and warned they would sabotage any vehicle ignoring the transport ban. Such threats have stopped about 90 percent of the nation's transport in the past. Private operators used flatbed and pickup trucks to transport people throughout <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and some vehicles carried white flags. News reports said citizens were offering similar transport services in other cities. On Wednesday, when campaigning officially ended, rebels attacked the presidential palace with grenades and bombs and killed a prominent rightist political adviser in the capital. Also Wednesday, a civilian judge indicted two military officers on charges of massacring 10 peasants. It was the first time in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s nine-year civil war that officers have been indicted in a human rights case. In Wednesday night's attack on the palace, shrapnel from a rocket-propelled grenade injured a palace guard and six civilians who live nearby, authorities said.

 To the disappointment of curiosity seekers and law enforcement agents, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s top mobsters stayed away from the funeral of reputed mob boss <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferriola </PERSON>. About 150 mourners, including two dozen women in furs and jewelry and men in expensive tailored suits, paid their respects Wednesday in a flower-filled salon at the <LOCATION> Salerno </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Galewood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> on the city's far <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. But `` the big boys ... the people who are supposed to take over -LRB- the crime syndicate in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> -RRB- did n't show up,'' said a man who was comparing with another man the number of out-of-state licence plates they had counted. `` This was a bustout,'' he said, `` and you can call me an ` informed source.''' The two men declined to identify themselves. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a private watchdog group, would not comment on who attended the service or the burial in suburban Hillside. <PERSON> Ferriola </PERSON>, who authorities said rose through the ranks and had run the crime syndicate's day-to-day operations since 1973, died Saturday in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> after two heart transplants. He is survived by his wife and five children. The prospect of a gangland funeral attracted dozens of journalists, photographers and law agents.

 The American flag made its final appearance on the floor at a student art exhibit today, with three ledgers offering a handwritten history of the rage, pain, sympathy and support that the work provoked. The stage for the four weeks of heated debate was set by `` Dread'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, 24, with his work `` What is the Proper Way to Display the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Flag?'' Since the show opened at the School of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the work has triggered demonstrations, debate on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, censure by the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, submission of tough new flag-protection legislation in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a lawsuit seeking the flag's removal that was promptly dismissed by a judge The exhibit opened this morning without incident, said school spokeswoman <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` We expect it to be pretty quiet today,'' she said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday that he thought the flag-on-the-floor exhibit is `` disgraceful'' but added that he would be `` very wary'' of proposed legislation that would jail anyone for setting up such a display. `` I'm always worried about the right of free speech,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an Oval Office interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> and five other newspapers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was disgusted by the exhibit because `` there's a certain respect for the flag that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have.'' The controversy is all there in the ledgers that are part of the work: anger and pain from veterans, comment on First Amendment rights, opinions about <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s use of the flag as a powerful symbol, and more. The authors number in the hundreds, with myriad viewpoints. A sampling: `` A cheap publicity stunt, not art. It's sad you had to desecrate our flag to achieve recognition.'' `` Well, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, you got what you wanted.'' `` You should be put on the floor and walked on.'' `` Good work at provoking a reaction. That's what art is supposed to do.'' `` Dude, you think this is cool well, it's not.'' `` This took guts. If you believe in what you did, good for you.'' `` If you do n't like this country, move to a communist one.'' `` You skunk _ my father's flag was drapped -LRB- sic -RRB- over his coffin ...'' `` I think this is a lot of fuss over nothing.'' `` Becky call Ed.'' One visitor congratulated <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> on enlisting viewers to complete the piece with their comments _ `` living history.'' Another bemoaned the `` myopia'' of visitors who `` neglect all the art that surrounds them'' at the juried exhibit, which featured 66 minority-student works, mostly paintings. Viewers Wednesday were admitted in small groups for security reasons and allowed about 10 minutes at the school's public gallery. Many returned to the short line for another look. Security guards sighed with relief at the prospect of an end to the exhibit that drew hostile visitors and even threats. And in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a downtown showcase, a handful of protesters proudly waved <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> intended the flag to be spread on the floor beneath a framed, black-and-white montage featuring flag-draped coffins and Third World anti-American protest, and the shelf containing the ledgers. Protesters contend the arrangement invites visitors to walk on the flag, a claim disputed by school officials. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> has called his work revolutionary and says he had no apologies, despite death threats he said he and his mother have received. `` The bad news is that the flag does n't mean to the <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tylers </PERSON> of this country what it means to so many of us,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mars </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> vice president for administration, said earlier this week. `` The good news is that our system worked. The student was allowed to make his statement.''

 An Angolan air force jet crashed while landing at <LOCATION> Huambo </LOCATION> airport in central <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and the pilot was killed, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s state-run news agency reported Thursday. The Soviet-built MiG-21 was destroyed in the crash Wednesday, said the <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> agency in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. It identified the dead pilot as Lt. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lourenco </PERSON> and said the crash occurred while the jet was approaching the runway at <LOCATION> Huambo </LOCATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION>, a commission set up to investigate the crash ruled out the possibility rebels shot down the plane. The town of <LOCATION> Huambo </LOCATION> was once the main base of the <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> rebel movement, and there have been reports of heavy fighting in the region. <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that forces of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government claimed to have killed 89 rebels and freed more than 200 civilians held by the rebels in clashes in <LOCATION> Huambo </LOCATION> province and other parts of the country in the past week. In addition, seven rebel fighters and 25 of their civilian supporters turned themselves over to government troops, <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> quoted an army statement as saying. Four government soldiers died and 17 were wounded in the fighting, and two were missing in action, <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy of one child per couple and restrictions on early marriages are being widely ignored, according to a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> survey released Thursday. Results of the survey said that since the one-child policy was started in 1980, about 9 million babies a year have been born outside the state plan. <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> <PERSON> Peiyun </PERSON> said the survey was an `` alarm bell.'' She said the average Chinese couple between 1980 and 1987 had 2.47 children. Last year there were approximately 23 million births and 7 million deaths in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, pushing the nation's population close to 1.1 billion. The two-year survey, which covered 2 million people, found that women bearing two or more children accounted for 40 percent of the unauthorized births. About one-fifth of the unauthorized births were to women under 20, which is the legal age for women in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to marry, the People's Daily said in reporting results of the survey. The survey found that less than 60 percent of women of child-bearing age practice birth control. The government has had substantial success in limiting family sizes in cities but has met strong resistance in the countryside. Rural couples, wanting boys in particular to help in the fields and to care for them when they become old, have been willing to pay steep fines for violating the one-child policy. The government has acknowledged that its target of limiting population to 1.2 billion in the year 2000 is not possible. Estimates for the number of Chinese at the turn of the century have jumped to 1.3 billion, about 20 percent of total world population.

 Foreign diplomats and wealthy executives are smuggling more than $ 10 million of gold and emeralds out of the country every year, a newspaper reported Thursday. To curb the trafficking, the independent <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> is pressing for tougher laws, and the government is considering setting up a special police unit, The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee today approved legislation to open the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> to oil exploration, rejecting an amendment to delay it until a national energy plan is developed. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> adopted a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., that would allow drilling while a study on energy conservation is under way An amendment to the bill that would have delayed any drilling until the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary presented <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with a comprehensive energy plan was defeated on a 12-7 vote. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., called the amendment, offered by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., a `` killer amendment'' that would effectively stop any oil drilling in the `` We have been studying energy policy in this committee for 17 years,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. More conservation is needed, he said, but in the meantime more domestic oil production must begin. Estimates as to the amount of oil that may be found in the refuge vary, with the minimum put at 3.2 billion barrels. The bill, which pits conservationists against development interests, now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for a vote. It has not been taken up by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The measure was introduced last session, but failed to get a vote on the floor of either the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday, the committee refused to tie a requirement that cars be more fuel efficient to the drilling legislation. That amendment, offered by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cars would have to get an average 34 miles to the gallon by the year 2000, or the manufacturer would be penalized. `` We would get more oil from the Metzenbaum amendment than we would from ANWR -LRB- the wildlife refuge -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said he might be persuaded to vote in favor of searching for oil in the refuge, `` but it does n't make sense to use it in gas guzzlers.'' He said Americans have `` gotten fat and happy,'' are buying big cars and are not serious about dealing with `` an energy crisis that is coming just as certainly as God made little green apples.'' In opposing the amendment, Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said the committee did not have jurisdiction over auto mileage, and that it should go through the commerce committee. He said as much as 9 billion barrels of oil might be found in the refuge, lessening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on imported fuel. Other estimates have put the expected production to be about 4 billion barrels. The refuge, which is just east of <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, is the breeding ground for one of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest remaining herds of migratory caribou and the home of wildlife such as polar bear, musk oxen, wolves, arctic foxes, waterfowl and fish. Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., said the <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> amendment could raise the cost of automobiles and cause layoffs in the industry It was defeated on a 9-9 vote.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Commuters jammed buses and taxis and clashes broke out in at least one subway station Thursday after thousands of city subway workers went on strike to demand the system's president resign. Subway President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Myong-nong </PERSON> ordered strikers to return to work by early Friday or face disciplinary action. Union officials refused. Subway officials said about 6,000 of the system's 7,732 employees participated in the strike, the first extended work stoppage in the <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 15-year history. More than 2,300 strikers were arrested. A sudden snowstorm that hit <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> during the morning added to congestion and confusion in city streets clogged with heavy traffic. The 3 million people who use the subway daily in this city of about 10 million struggled to find alternate transportation. Buses were packed with riders, and taxis carried up to five passengers. Union leaders who spoke on condition of anonymity said they would stay on strike until their demands for <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s resignation were met and all arrested strikers were released and charges dropped. Union leaders accuse <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> of acting in bad faith during labor negotiations last week. The talks resulted in an agreement on new pay and working conditions, but strikers said they do not trust the subway corporation to live up to the deal. Strikers also demanded withdrawal of lawsuits against labor leaders who organized protests last week in which subway workers allowed commuters to ride free. `` The strike will probably continue for a few days as police have detained thousands of protesters and most union members are ready to resist the government's stern measures,'' one union official said. About 4,000 riot police raided a subway depot in eastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to disperse 3,000 strikers who had seized the facility overnight and erected barricades. Armored trucks fired tear gas, and bulldozers removed the barricades. Some strikers hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police, but they were overpowered in less than 30 minutes. Police said 2,344 strikers were arrested at the depot. Police said most of those arrested would be released by Friday but that 30 would be charged with organizing an illegal strike. The government mobilized more than 10,000 extra buses, trucks and cars to provide emergency service. Government workers were instructed to report to work one hour late and school pupils one hour early to help reduce traffic. Limited service was provided on some subway lines by managers, non-striking workers and drivers drafted from the national railroad system, subway officials said. The officials reported that the city's four subway lines operated at 54 percent of their capacity. Mayor <PERSON> Koh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kun </PERSON> apologized to commuters for the inconvenience. `` We want the strikers to return to work and drop their unjust demands,'' he said. The strikers have demanded that <PERSON> Koh </PERSON> sign the new labor agreement, but <PERSON> Koh </PERSON> said he could not do that because he did not represent the corporation. The only previous strike by subway workers was a two-hour stoppage in June 1988.

At the end of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' news conference Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, made a surprise appearance to tell reporters that he would nominate <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, a conservative <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> veteran, for the post `` whether some like it or not.'' <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> had decided a day earlier not to make the race, but <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said that decision was the result of pressure from the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> delegation, which did n't want <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>'s support to be diluted. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> should be the heir-apparent to <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, who is expected to retire in the next few years, and should therefore be installed now as whip. Both <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, who have been soliciting support since <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was nominated last Friday, claimed to have majority support among the 174-member House Republican Conference. The contest was seen largely as one of style, and to some extent one of generations and ideology. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, a six-term lawmaker best known for his attacks on House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, was generally favored by conservative colleagues who believe the party's current leadership is too unwilling to do high-profile warfare with the ruling Democrats. <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> was seen by many as someone who has paid his dues as the senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and as an inside player on various <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> legislative initiatives. Leadership sources said soon after <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> announced last Friday that he planned to make the whip's race, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> voiced his support and has been quietly campaigning for his <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> colleague, who is closer to his style.

<HEAD>Satellite Facing Budget Ax Helps Locate Earthquake Faults</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Scientists have discovered a series of unknown earthquake faults thanks to pictures from a satellite that has been facing the budget ax. The faults are located in the central and eastern parts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> and were found using images taken by the Landsat satellite, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The faults were discovered by studying a series of images taken in differing optical and infrared spectra, according to scientists at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> ` s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and at <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Some of the faults are inactive, but others may still be seismically active, the scientists said. The faults form part of a complex fault region between <LOCATION> Death </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> fault region. Without the Landsat images, the faults would not have been discovered, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. His announcement was made even as scientists and politicians were struggling over financing to keep the Landsat system going. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced recently that it would have to shut down the Landsat system at the end of this month because of a lack of money to operate it. Subsequently Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> began encouraging other government agencies to chip in funds to keep the system going and the cutoff has at least been delayed. Landsat, which studies the Earth's surface for mapping, mineral studies and other research, still faces a tenuous financual future, however.

<HEAD>Tibetan Leader Optimistic Chinese Will Negotiate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHARMSALA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tibetans' spiritual leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, said Thursday he believes <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> is ready for negotiations that would grant greater freedom to his people and the land he fled 30 years ago. In an interview at his exile headquarters in the remote Himalayan foothills of north <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> admitted he has had no recent indication of this from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities. In fact, the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> has been under martial law since bloody anti-Chinese protests there last week. But the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> adhered to his belief that change is sweeping <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, that the new concept of reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will soon come to the world's other major communist power. `` Within a few months, talks may start,'' the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said. In the meantime, he said, he will continue to support non-violent protest in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. `` Peaceful demonstrations _ that I am supporting. That is the only way to make -LRB- our situation -RRB- known to the outside world,'' the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said. Tibetans `` should not indulge in damaging and burning property. They should not indulge in stoning. Even if the Chinese open fire, they should not retaliate,'' he said. The Dalai Lama spoke at midafternoon in the hilltop compound that houses his residence, offices, Thekchen Choeling Temple and <LOCATION> Namgyal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monastery </LOCATION> where maroon-robed monks debate ancient scriptures and venerate this bespectacled, 54-year-old farmer's son as a living god-king, the 14th reincarnation of the earthly manifestation of <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>. On another March 16 afternoon, exactly 30 years ago, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> was in a more remote and far grander Himalayan compound, in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. Surrounded by Chinese troops who had moved their artillery within range of his palace, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> and his advisers were at the brink of the decision that would propel him and eventually 110,600 other Tibetans into exile. By the night of March 17, he had slipped out of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>'s Norbulinka Palace disguised as a Tibetan soldier and shouldering a rifle By April 18, 1959, he was safe in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, free to speak against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But the Tibetans' uprising had failed. The Chinese guns had bombarded <PERSON> Norbulinka </PERSON>, and thousands of Tibetans were dead. It was the approach of this anniversary that resulted in more bloodshed in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> last week. By official count, 16 people were killed when police opened fire during a pro-independence demonstration in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> in which Chinese-owned shops and vehicles were set afire. Western travelers said as many as 20 or 30 were killed. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s subsequent ban on foreigners entering <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> makes it impossible for the outside world to know with any certainty what is happening in the ancient kingdom, which Chinese troops entered in 1950. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> maintains <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has traditionally been part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> and his government in exile say <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has been independent for centuries. `` In the last few days, you see a sad situation within <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>,'' the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said, a long shawl of finely spun wool protecting him from the mountain chill. `` In the last 30 years, they -LRB- the Chinese -RRB- have used every repression,'' he said, speaking in English. `` We lost everything in the last 30 years, but we still remain. We are the same Tibetans the Chinese bullied 30 years ago.'' Despite the imposition of martial law, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said he thought <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s eagerness to open its economy to the outside world would bring greater awareness and greater tolerance to political problems at home. Reflecting a sense that time may be running out, that an influx of Chinese settlers in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> would obliterate the separate Tibetan identity, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> last June made his biggest concession to date. He proposed his homeland become `` a self-governing democratic political entity... In association with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' In return, he said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> could retain troops on Tibetan soil and handle <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s foreign policy. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> rejected the proposal, saying it failed to relinquish the concept of Tibetan independence, but it said it was willing to talk to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> on Thursday repeated that talks should start at a lower level, in a neutral spot outside Chinese control. `` If the Chinese do not want to talk, OK. The last 30 years we spent like this,'' he said.

 The world's land areas have become wetter over the last century or so, but the rainfall increases have skipped large areas of the planet, according to a study released Thursday. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> have seen measurable increases in precipitation since the late 1800s, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported. At the same time, however, there has been a decline in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and in tropical areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The analysis of rainfall patterns was compiled by <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, R.S. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Eischeid </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION>. Their findings are to be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research. The scientists looked at nearly a century of records. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said the primary period of increasing rainfall in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> was from the 1940s to the mid-1950. In the Northern Hemisphere, the overall trend is almost unchanged, he said, noting, however, that there seems to have been a decline in rainfall in northern tropical areas in the last 15 years or so. Rainfall patterns show substantial variability from time to time, the scientists noted, changing over periods of a decade or more. Thus, they said, it is difficult to determine whether rainfall has been affected by long-term phenomena such as that embodied in the Greenhouse theory, which predicts that changes in the atmosphere will cause worldwide temperatures to warm, leading to changes in rainfall and other climate phenomena.

 <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> congressman about to become secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, is tackling one of the most difficult management jobs in government with only an outsider's knowledge of modern weapons and with the extra weight of a late start. `` All the problems are compounded'' for <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, who served almost seven years in the job. `` Two months have gone by, a great many trains are leaving the station and they all have to be caught at once,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday. `` He's a fine choice and he will be very good. But he faces a very daunting task.'' Other officials still inside the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, who asked not to be named, say it's possible for a congressman to jump into the huge military bureaucracy and shine. For example, one said, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> did well in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. And <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> held a leadership post among House Republicans, is no stranger to most of the big issues, the official added. But <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is about to leap from running a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> office with relatively few employees to becoming the boss of 3.1 million people. And he is doing so with little time to select key assistants and aides. The first important job he'll face is trimming the fiscal 1990 budget. And he's never played that peculiar brand of Pentagon politics. `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is about to walk into this job right when it's time to play referee among four services that are attacking each other in hopes of saving their own budget,'' said one official. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to slash about $ 6.4 billion from its fiscal 1990 budget proposal `` and now it's dog-eat-cat time,'' the source said <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> recalled such military budget fights, saying, `` Everybody has recommendations of their own _ their own hopes and needs _ and there's never enough for everybody. ... It will be very, very tough'' for <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. To make matters worse, the congressman does n't have the detailed military-program knowledge possessed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first choice for the job, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>. Tower, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was widely known for his exhaustive knowledge of such details. His personal life, however _ including allegations of excessive drinking and womanizing and his financial relationships with military contractors _ led to rejection of his nomination last week. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, by contrast, after being lauded for his honor and integrity, was approved 20-0 Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and is expected to clear the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> without opposition Friday. One Pentagon official said anyone who sets his mind to it can learn what weapons the nation depends on, how they work, how they're produced and how much they cost `` But that takes time, and <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> does n't have any,'' he said. Tower knew the inside politics, the `` games between the services and program quirks,'' another source said. As if setting budget priorities were not enough, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> also will have only about a month to help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> make broad decisions that will affect national security for years to come. For example, the administration must decide whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs a mobile nuclear missile to deter Soviet attack and, if so, what type and how large it should be. The administration also must decide how fast it will attempt to build B-2 stealth bombers _ a decision with huge financial implications. Other pending decisions include how vigorously to develop a `` Star Wars'' anti-missile defense system, whether to continue supporting a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> built around 15 aircraft carriers, whether military manpower should be cut, what goals to aim for in negotiating a nuclear arms treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and how to walk the tightrope of safeguarding <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> while negotiating reductions to conventional arms. `` He's going to have to do about 14 or 15 things at once,'' says <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, who was sworn in as secretary of defense just one day after <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> began his presidency. `` It's too bad he lost these months.''

 Blacks die more often as infants and have shorter, harsher lives if they survive. They have more trouble getting jobs, are more likely to be poor and suffer more violent crime and divorces. In an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that is far from colorblind, the quality of black life from cradle to grave is worse than it is for whites and the gaps are widening in some areas, according to recent studies. `` There are still deep inequalities between the races,'' said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON>, director of research for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The nation can not allow such a significant part of its citizenry to experience such disadvantages.'' A black child born in 1986 can expect to die six years sooner than a white child, according to a report released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Life expectancy among whites rose from 75.3 years to 75.4 years between 1984 and 1986. For blacks, the number dropped from 69.7 to 69.4. Among the culprits that shorten black lives are infant mortality, murders, AIDS and pneumonia. Of 1,000 black babies born in 1984, 18.4 died before they were a year old. The mortality rate for white babies was 9.4 per 1,000 births, according to the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Low birth weight and lack of proper medical care were the main causes of death, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. A black baby is three times more likely than a white one to be born to a mother who had no prenatal care, according to a 1989 study by the Urban League. In 1986, there were 22,000 murders. Almost half the victims were black, and the murder rate is almost six times higher for blacks than whites. Black males are nearly as likely to be murdered as they are to die in a car accident, the government said. Blacks make up 12 percent of the population but are twice as likely to get AIDS. Influenza and pneunomia caused 28 of each 100,000 deaths among black men, far higher than the 18 per 100,000 rate posted for white men. Other studies show disproportionate differences between the races. The poverty rate for blacks in 1986 was 31.1 percent, compared with the 11 percent rate for whites, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said. The black rate is worse than the 1969 figure of 28 percent. The jobless rate among blacks in 1987 was 13 percent, 2.5 times the 5.3 percent rate for whites. If agencies counted blacks who were so discouraged they have quit looking for work, the rate would approach 25 percent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Full </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION>. The median black family income was $ 17,604 compared with $ 30,809 for whites, according to the Urban League. That same year, 44.2 percent of black families had incomes of less than $ 10,000, more than triple the rate for whites. In black families, single women are more apt to be in charge. Black males have the highest death rates from accidents and violence of any ethnic group with 153 per 100,000. The white rate is 98.6 per 100,000, according to a 1984 Urban League report. The divorce rate among blacks jumped from 45 per 1,000 marriages in 1960 to 178 per 1,000 marriages in 1981. White couples divorced at the rate of 27 per 1,000 in 1960 and 82 per 1,000 in 1981, the report said. `` Black males run a deadly gauntlet of dangers that cause a steady attrition in the number of men who can support families,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON>, an Urban League researcher. According to the 1980 Census report, elderly blacks were 3.5 times as likely as older whites to live in dwellings without plumbing. About 44 percent of homes occupied by blacks lacked central heating. In 1985, elderly non-whites, mostly blacks, were five times as likely to be slaying victims than whites, and non-white males were 2.7 times more likely to be robbery victims than elderly white males, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Black Aged. Black males had the greatest slippage in college enrollment among any racial or ethnic group over the past decade, according to a study in January by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Enrollment dropped from 4.3 percent in 1976 to 3.5 percent by 1986. Blacks also earned the fewest degrees and made the least progress in number of faculty positions held. `` Those who do manage to attend college find considerable racism and chilly environments on many white campuses,'' said the report by <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Fair housing is also a challenge, according to a February study in Social Science Quarterly. An <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> or Hispanic who has finished third-grade has a higher probability of living in an integrated neighborhood than a black with a doctorate, the study said. And an Asian or Hispanic who makes less than $ 2,500 a year has a higher chance of living in an integrated neighborhood than a black who earns more than $ 50,000. `` Blacks are exposed to higher crime rates, less effective educational systems, higher mortality risks, more dilapidated surroundings and a poorer socio-economic environment than whites,'' said researcher <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. `` Integration is possible, even likely, for all ethnic and racial groups except blacks.''

 A federal judge today ordered <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to let a Christian group hand out religious literature on the beach during the annual exercise in excess known as spring break. The group had sued the resort town after being warned of an ordinance against solicitation on the beach. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> said today that `` the public beaches are a public forum,'' and he advised the town that distribution of religious literature is protected under the Constitution. He ended the hearing by telling both sides, `` God bless you, gentlemen.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> officials have estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 students will converge on the island resort near the mouth of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> in March. A rock concert on the beach is scheduled for Friday. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>, a minister at <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>'s interdominational Word of God Family Church, said his <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> wants to provide an alternative to the companies promoting beer and condoms to the spring-breakers. City Manager <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Campirano </PERSON> said the town had not tried to single out any one group with its ordinance, which he said applies to commercial as well as religious solicitation. `` When the public is out there on the beach, they have a right to be out there and enjoy it and be left alone,'' he said.

 An 83-year-old man believed to have become disoriented while driving during a snowstorm strayed 40 miles from his destination and died, possibly from a heart attack. The body of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> was found Wednesday in his burned-out truck, which was in a ditch near the central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Monticello </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Petrie </PERSON> had been on his way to pick up his wife at work in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, seven miles from their home, during a storm that dumped more than 7 inches of snow Tuesday. Authorities speculate <PERSON> Petrie </PERSON>, who had a heart ailment, became disoriented in the rush-hour storm, took the wrong route and had a heart attack, causing the vehicle to veer into a ditch. One theory is that the truck's accelerator pedal stuck, causing the tires to spin then heat to the point of catching fire. The body was found about 13 hours after <PERSON> Petrie </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Delores </PERSON>, filed a missing-person report, said <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Quarnstrom </PERSON>.

Construction workers getting skyboxes ready for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> opener April 4 joined the picket line when they arrived for work in the morning, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON>. He estimated more than 150 persons picketed or honored the lines. <PERSON> Malkowsky </PERSON> said about 300 building-trades workers refused to cross picket lines. The 24 groundskeepers are paid an average of $ 21,000 a year, he said. `` They -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> management -RRB- did n't have enough time to slot us in for scheduled talks because they were busy giving millions of dollars away to the ballplayers,'' he said. Union attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said the ballplayers union also will be asked to join in when they return from spring training in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Malkowsky </PERSON> said, `` I'm hoping we can resolve it before the season starts.'' The groundskeepers walked out over a management effort to cut nearly in half their $ 14-an-hour wage and win other concessions, said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Bongiorno </PERSON>, a 23-year veteran of the groundskeeping crew. The team said in a statement, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> are certainly willing to continue negotiations but, in any event, we assure our fans that this will not disrupt operations at the ballpark this season.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to discuss the strike further. No new talks were scheduled, <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier has been charged with espionage for allegedly handing over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense secrets to communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> announced today. American military authorities said they filed the charges against Spec. 4 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, who recently disappeared for 11 days near the East German border. He turned himself in to military authorities last week. He also brought back a lap-top computer he took from his unit, where he worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist, officials have said. One Army officer told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the East Germans notified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had contacted them, but it was not immediately clear why the communist country would have done that. In a statement sent to the news media, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> `` has been charged with espionage _ communicating documents and @ or information relating to national defense to the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> -LRB- GDR -RRB-.'' The statement said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> was charged with `` moving classified documents to the GDR and transferring classified information to unauthorized persons.'' It provided no further details about the information allegedly handed over to the East Germans and said no date has been set for the soldier's trial. A 5th Corps spokesman, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` He gave them information. We're just not in a position to say what it was.'' A deputy spokesman, Maj. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, said in an interview: `` It is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national defense information as far as it pertains to our <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> mission and to the general defense plan as a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> force.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said that `` the evidence we have that he crossed the border was given to us by the GDR Ministry of Foreign Affairs.'' He said, `` We were told by the -LRB- East German -RRB- ministry <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> made contact with them.'' <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> disappeared Feb. 21 from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION>, 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. Some officials speculated that he defected because a military vehicle he signed out was found Feb. 23 near the town of <LOCATION> Obersuhl </LOCATION>, a remote rural area northeast of <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION> and near the East German border. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist. He was responsible for operating equipment that detects enemy radar and other signals. He has been stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since March 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> communique said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> also was charged with `` failure to obey the lawful regulations that require him to get permission to travel to the German Democratic Republic.'' The regulations also require soldiers to check with their security officer `` before going into a communist-controlled country.'' The statement did not say where <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> went inside <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or how he crossed the heavily guarded border. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, who was being held in pretrial confinement in <LOCATION> Mannheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, already has been charged with being absent without leave and other offenses. The 21-year-old soldier comes from <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Before today's announcement, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials described <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> as `` a good clean-cut soldier'' who had a `` perfect record. `` In fact, he had been promoted and nominated for ` Soldier of the Month' twice in the year he has been here,'' an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON>, said earlier this month. `` That's what makes it so baffling.'' Officials who thought <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had defected recalled that in March 1987, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Army Pvt. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, defected with his West German girlfriend to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in November 1987 and was court-martialed as a deserter. He was given a bad conduct discharge after being found guilty of the lesser charge of being absent without leave.

<TEXT>
 Authorities arrested three town magistrates and suspended two <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> police officers accused of torturing prisoners during the dictatorship of Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, officials said Thursday. The arrests and suspensions are part of a campaign launched by Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who toppled <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in a Feb. 3 coup. The magistrates, who have executive and judicial powers akin to those of a mayor or justice of the peace, were accused in the 1979 deaths of 24-year-old <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Irala </PERSON> and his brothers, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> Sindulfo </PERSON>, 27. They died in <LOCATION> Tebicuarymi </LOCATION>, a town 80 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>. The mother of the three, <PERSON> Leonora </PERSON> <PERSON> Irala </PERSON>, told human rights lawyers her sons were tortured by electric shock and had their teeth pulled out with pliers. `` My sons' cries and screams for help could be heard in the whole town,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Irala </PERSON> was quoted as telling the <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>. She said her sons were detained and tortured for five days in connection with the slaying of the son of the local ward president of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Formal charges have not been filed against <PERSON> Tebicuarymi </PERSON> magistrates <PERSON> Elvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salustiano </PERSON> <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON>, authorities said. Police announced the suspension of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> officers <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> <PERSON> Spelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Almada </PERSON> <PERSON> Saprissa </PERSON>, who have been accused of torture during the <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> regime. Lawyers for human rights organizations said dozens of formal complaints were filed against those two and others but never were acted upon. `` I know of at least 100 different suits against <PERSON> Almada </PERSON> <PERSON> Saprissa </PERSON> for torture,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, a human rights lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Artemio </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> said, `` They will be given the opportunity to defend themselves.'' `` We ca n't be unjust even with those who are unjust with us,'' he added. The campaign against torture began a month ago when Interior Minister <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Machuca </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> pledged to eliminate torture chambers in police stations and urged citizens who had been tortured to file legal complaints. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> ruled <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> 34 years before being overthrown in a bloody coup by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who had been his second-in-command in the army. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was accused of brutal repression of opponents during his rule, and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1976 labeled his government a dictatorship. He has lived in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> since the coup.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government joined friends and relatives of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> today in urging the journalist's captors in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to release him immediately on his fourth anniversary as a hostage. The continued detention of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and other hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` is a criminal act which serves no cause,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The hostage-holders should release their captives immediately and unconditionally, and we call on all countries with influence over the hostages, such as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, to use that influence to obtain freedom for all the hostages,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` certainly is concerned about the hostages,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was making a speech. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continues efforts to seek the release of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and eight other American hostages. At a ceremony on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> marking <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s fourth year as a captive, his sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is `` frustrated, tired and lonely ... and tired of being caged like an animal.'' In a message transmitted to the news agency's staff, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> said `` our hearts cry out in protest'' over <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s plight. `` It's time for those holding <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to release him and to end the unconscionable suffering of an innocent man. Each of us in our own special way should mark this day with contemplation and prayer for <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s release,'' <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> continued. `` As has been true from the beginning on that Saturday morning in 1985, our efforts on his behalf will continue in all corners of the world until our brave friend is free once more.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, who moderated an hour-long ceremony in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office building, said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has not been forgotten as he enters his fifth year as a captive in a small, dingy room. `` We ca n't turn our backs when people are denied human rights,'' <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON>, a former hostage held for a time with <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, said that before his release on July 26, 1986, he promiseed the journalist `` that I would never forget him, that others would never forget him.'' Colleagues who knew and worked with <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, one of nine American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, talked of his dedication to his job and his desire to tell the story of the war-torn nation. `` He took big risks ... and he has paid an awful price these last four years,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignatius </PERSON>, an associate editor of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` I want to see <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> released tomorrow, if possible.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, diplomatic correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said the radical Moslem Shiites believed to hold <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> are damaging Islam's image by keeping hostages. `` The only way your story is ever going to be told again is if our comrades are free,'' he said. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Laingen </PERSON>, a former hostage in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, echoed that thought. The hostage-holders are doing a `` grievous disservice to Islam,'' he said at the event, which was co-sponsored by No Greater Love, a humanitarian organization, and the <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Free <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, attended the ceremony, as did Reps. <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foglietta </PERSON>, D-Pa. Also in attendance were Lebanese Ambassador <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouhabib </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Burleigh </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for On Wednesday, <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said he would not accept `` the explanation that nothing can be done.'' He was to introduce a resolution today in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> condemning hostage-taking. `` Something must be done, the executive branch must seek to use every avenue, formal and informal, to win the hostages freedom,'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said in a statement. Meantime, administration officials say there has been no change in the hostage policy since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> assumed office nearly two months ago. `` In terms of our policy, there has been no change, and I do n't foresee one,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mideast </ORGANIZATION> specialist, speaking on condition of anonymity He called the policy the only one that might work. Since the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was embarrassed in November 1986 by revelations it had sold weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy has been, `` No concessions, but we're willing to talk to anyone,'' another official said. But Say has been critical of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government efforts on behalf of the hostages. `` You want to hope they are working on it, but let's face it, four years speaks for itself,'' she said. Say said she does not think the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has made any new drives to free the hostages. `` Basically, things are just status quo.'' She listed specific initiatives the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could pursue, including payments to the families of Iranians killed last July when the USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian jetliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it is working on a payment plan. `` You begin to wonder what it takes to move people,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said. `` They have heard and read how hostages have died, how they have gone mad, how they exist from day-to-day in the most barbaric conditions and the world does not respond.'' Officials say different factions hold the nine American hostages who have been seized in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but they are elements of the umbrella group, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, over which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> exhibits control. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has called for the unconditional release of all hostages before it will talk with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The families' frustration follows a brief sense of optimism that followed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Jan. 20 inaugural address in which he repeated his opposition to any deals, but seemed to send a signal to the captors. `` There are today Americans who are held against their will in foreign lands and Americans who are unaccounted for,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Assistance can be show here, and will be long remembered. Good will begets good will.'' Since then, other developments have intervened, most recently the furor over `` The Satanic Verses,'' a book by <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> that Moslems consider to be blasphemous. The Iranian government has called for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s death. `` The situation has fallen apart again,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mammod </PERSON> <PERSON> Faksh </PERSON>, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION>, said he does n't expect any good news for the hostages soon. `` The Lebanese civil war is still ongoing and there is more factionalism in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> now than ever,'' he said. `` So many things do n't bode well for the hostages. They are still alive because it is in the best interest of the hostage-takers to keep them alive.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is the designated contact with the family members. He said he tries to call the families every two weeks to reassure them `` someone is paying attention to them,'' and to put current events in their proper context. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> also monitors the dozens of letters the department receives each month from Americans on the hostages. In the 18 months he has worked at the job, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said he has not noticed any change in the volume.

<HEAD>IRS Says Budget Crunch Won't Slow Return Processing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, under heavy fire for often answering taxpayers' questions incorrectly, will not slow its processing of tax refunds despite scattered personnel and supply shortages caused by the budget crunch, acting Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said Thursday. `` We have a management problem trying to conserve resources. ... We are looking for about $ 50 million'' to continue present levels of operations for the next six months, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> oversight subcommittee. But the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will not let the problem slow returns processing, reduce services to taxpayers or deter the agency's enforcement efforts, he vowed. On another problem, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> appeared to confirm reports that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has had a policy of sometimes not telling taxpayers when they neglect to take credit for taxes withheld from their paychecks. That would result in an overpayment of taxes. Until last December, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told Rep. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Tenn., some credits `` were not picked up'' at one stage of the agency's review of tax returns and `` it is possible that taxpayers did not get the refund they were entitled to. Although changes in those procedures were made last year, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> added, `` I still am not completely satisfied with that program.'' He said he has asked for a report from other <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> officials. The existence of such a policy was asserted by <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> in interviews with Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., and The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> One employee, speaking only on the condition she not be named, said an agency handbook prohibited telling a taxpayer that he or she had neglected to subtract taxes withheld from taxes owed. In most such cases, she said, taxpayers were overcharged by $ 100 to $ 1,000, and often these cases involved retirees' pensions. When <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was asked about the policy, she said, `` We were told the taxpayers had to find their own mistakes.'' There were so many complaints from <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> workers about the policy that it was modified last year to permit notification of taxpayers who failed to subtract taxes withheld from wages or from periodic pension payments, the employee said. But the old policy remains in effect in cases of lump-sum pension payments. The Memphis worker is involved in an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> program to identify taxpayers who failed to report some or all of their income. She and others in the program start checking returns about 15 months after they are filed. If they find underreporting, they send the taxpayer a form letter asking for an explanation. After <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> testified Thursday, his principal spokesman, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, said the agency's policy is `` to make sure that people who are entitled to refunds get them.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> spent a good deal of his time before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel apologizing that <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees in some areas of the nation are correctly answering taxpayers' telephoned questions barely half the time. `` Our accuracy rate is unacceptable,'' he said. `` We will not be satisfied until we see substantial improvement.'' Although the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> disagree on just how often telephone `` assistors'' are wrong, the precise figure did n't seem to matter to members of the subcommittee. `` You're talking about whether we should give you a ` D' or a ` D-minus,''' said Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the chairman. `` Calling the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> for tax advice is a real crapshoot.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> have been exchanging words since March 10, when the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> called a news conference to announce that its 5,000 employees who answer taxpayers' telephoned questions were giving correct answers about 71 percent of the time. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the correct figure for the nation was closer to 62 percent and said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had labeled some misleading answers as correct. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> apologized for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> interpretation. But ironically, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> Thursday announced that an updated, although more limited, test indicated that <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees were correct about 66 percent of the time. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and its 115,000 employees, who collect about $ 1 trillion a year in taxes, are having trouble living within their $ 5.2 billion budget. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources Thursday as saying the agency `` is in the throes of a full-fledged cash crisis.'' Much of the trouble can be traced to the fact that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> $ 100 million less this year than it asked for and then required the agency to cut other programs to finance a pay raise for workers. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> saw the trouble coming late last year and asked the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to request additional money, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> refused.

 Some of the best engineering students in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> are busy trying to build cars that will take them 200 miles over four days. That wo n't be so easy as it sounds, because the cars will have to be powered only by the sun. The <LOCATION> Montpelier </LOCATION>, Vt.-to-Cambridge, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, race, called the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sol </ORGANIZATION>, is set for May 25-28. The race is patterned after a competition in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> that has attracted hundreds of entries since it began in 1985, including several from the schools involved in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> race this year. `` There's a very high interest level,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wills </PERSON>, who is coordinating the race. `` At <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>, the solar car project has attracted the most interest of any engineering project that I've seen.'' The winning team will get a trip to the European race, also called the Tour de Sol, this summer. Solar-powered cars use photovoltaic cells to collect energy from sunlight that power their electric motors. The cars can reach speeds of more than 60 mph. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> team, said it is redesigning parts of the car that entered last year's European race but was disqualified because of a technical problem in the drive system. Changes will include a new drive system and a new computer. `` We did pretty well, considering we were using a back-up drive system,'' <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said. The other four schools participating are <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Worcester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't know of any single activity on campus that has created as much enthusiasm as the solar car project,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Larrabee </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wills </PERSON> said the race will be run along back roads and will take the competitors through each of the five campuses. The times for the four daily legs of the race will be compared to calculate the winner. `` We managed to hit all the campuses, and that's a big selling point for us,'' he said. `` Everyone on the campuses will be able to see the cars.'' Though the Tour de Sol cars are designed with the hope that one could someday be used commercially, for now their cost is too high. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> car, for example, cost about $ 80,000. <PERSON> Wills </PERSON> said students get their schools or companies to sponsor the cars, but the cost is worth it because students learn about many engineering problems. `` Even the professors learn a lot,'' he said.

 The county jail boiled with rage after a deputy warden and two guards were charged with beating to death an inmate, and the men were held today in a closed municipal jail for their safety. Inmates of the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail shouted from their cells and smashed windows, and one set a bedsheet on fire outside a window as about 75 relatives and friends of the victim, <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, rallied outside on Wednesday. Bedsheets and toilet paper flapped from the windows of some cells. `` People are out here to pay their respects,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 25, a protester. `` And we're here for justice. Everybody makes mistakes, but they made a big one. That boy had a family and now he's in his grave.'' At least six police officers stood guard outside the jail during the demonstration, and about 20 others watched the crowd. There were no confrontations. Earlier in the day, corrections Officers <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 39, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumers </PERSON>, 35, and Deputy Warden <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, 52, were charged with murdering <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who was in jail on a burglary charge. <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> DePascale </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, 28, was beaten for 15 to 20 minutes in a jail elevator and left for 16 hours in a basement holding cell before guards summoned medical help. He died Saturday at a hospital where he was brought two days earlier in a coma. A coroner's report said he was beaten in the head, arms and body. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Angel </PERSON>, said inmates told his family that guards used nightsticks on <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. The defendants were unable to raise $ 50,000 bail and were sent to the <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, which was ordered closed by the state a month ago because it had no cameras to watch for suicide attempts. Officials are deciding whether to install cameras. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said he would not send the three to the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail for fear of exposing them to attacks from other inmates. The county board of freeholders, in response to protests over the killing, said it would investigate allegations about the existence of a `` goon squad'' of corrections workers who routinely beat inmates. <PERSON> DePascale </PERSON> said there is a special unit that responds to crises but that there was no evidence of unprovoked attacks. No other criminal charges are planned, he said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved air-dropping intelligence data and recoilless rifles to help the Nicaraguan Contra rebels sink two ships carrying arms, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial was told today The disclosure came during testimony by former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s onetime boss at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. North lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> about a `` top secret'' Oct. 3, 1985 memo from North to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> in which <PERSON> North </PERSON> recommended the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government air-drop intelligence to the Contras. As <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> examined the memo on the witness stand, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, approved the recommendation and that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> added the words: `` President approved.'' The approval came at a time when the Boland Amendment prohibited any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government agency involved in intelligence activities from using money to assist the Contras. According to <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s description of the memo, the steps <PERSON> North </PERSON> recommended were `` not only extraordinary, but also expensive'' and followed a meeting on the matter by the <ORGANIZATION> Restricted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> described that as an interagency committee that made `` recommendations on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' with one deputy from each of several departments involved in intelligence. The last page of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s memo describes `` what to tell the president,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who read portions of it aloud. One portion the lawyer read said that `` we intend to air drop intelligence along with two recoilless rifles which will be used to sink one or both of the arms carriers.'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said the recoilless rifles are `` designed to knock out a very hard target'' such as a tank, a bunker or a plane on the ground.'' `` Or sink a ship as it says here,'' added <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said the memo did n't come to him, since <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> dealt with it. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, was in another courtroom today for housekeeping matters concerning his case on charges that resemble <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he hoped that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial can get under way in summer or early fall, after <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial ends, and that he has not decided whether he or another judge will preside. The case had been in <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s court, but the judge decided he did n't want to hear it. In the meantime, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said, he will take care of any pre-trial matters. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told the judge he does not know yet whether the government will follow its action in the North case and drop two key charges _ conspiracy, and theft of government property _ that had been lodged against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> testified Wednesday at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial that inducements worth $ 110 million were discussed orally with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' president but not given to him in writing. The Honduran deal and other third-country help to the Contras were kept secret because the countries' relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be `` damaged'' if the support was disclosed, said <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. Also, exposure would touch off a confrontation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Four of the charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> are that he lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 by denying that he was involved in assisting the Contras. A Sept. 13, 1984, memo from North to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> detailed how an assistant secretary of state told congressional intelligence committees that foreign countries were providing support to the Contras but that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official did n't know which ones. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> acknowledged he took no steps to inform <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of what he, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and others in the administration knew at the time, that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> was providing $ 1 million a month for the Contras. The secret payments to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> amounted to $ 35 million in speeded-up deliveries of rifles, ammunition, machine guns and other military aid, plus $ 75 million in economic assistance. In addition, there is other unspecified assistance that is classified and which has not been disclosed at the trial. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> initialed his approval of the Honduran plan on a memo dated Feb. 18, 1985. `` You're going to give them tens of millions of dollars to cooperate?'' North lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. `` Yes.'' `` There is nothing dirty about quid pro quo, is there?'' `` No.'' The Honduran arrangement was made near the beginning of a two-year span in which the so-called the Boland Amendment prohibited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the guerrillas.

<HEAD>FAA Raises Fines for Guns in Hand-Carried Luggage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A passenger who tries to take a gun through an airport screening point, even unwittingly, could be fined at least $ 1,000 under a newly toughened <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> policy, a spokesman said Thursday. If the weapon is loaded or there is an attempt to conceal it, fines could range up to $ 10,000, said spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regional authorities could pursue smaller fines against first-time offenders or issue warnings, <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. Under the new order, a penalty of $ 1,000 would be sought in civil court if the firearm was unloaded and ammunition was not accessible to the passenger. This would be increased to $ 2,000 if ammunition was found. The fine could be $ 2,500 for a loaded firearm and from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 if there was an attempt to conceal even an unloaded weapon. If a gun was used along with a threat, the civil penalty could be at least $ 10,000 in addition to any punishment that might result from criminal prosecution. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said 2,773 firearms were detected in airports last year, leading to 1,493 arrests. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said he could not immediately determine how many of the cases had led to successful prosecutions or the size of fines imposed. The agency said more than 70 percent of the guns were loaded. A survey showed that 26 guns discharged in luggage between 1975 and 1986, including one that killed an airline employee. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said the only legal way to transport a gun aboard an aircraft is in checked luggage, and if it's a handgun the luggage must be locked with the only key in the owner's possession. The weapon must be unloaded, and the owner must declare it to the airline when the luggage is checked.

 Council members hoping to keep undesirables off their wealthy island are considering installing closed circuit cameras to monitor bridges and the main highway into town. Town Manager <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Doney </PERSON> said the cameras would enable authorities to film `` vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists ... anyone coming to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to do anything of an illegal nature.'' He said he thought the cameras could have `` a very good psychological effect on deterring crime.'' Town Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> said the constitutionality of the proposal, submitted Tuesday by a resident, should be studied before the council votes on it, and council members asked the town's <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to study the matter. Council President <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Douthit </PERSON> said the idea was `` definitely worth the research.'' `` The only people who might be bothered by this are those with a guilty conscience,'' <PERSON> Douthit </PERSON> said. `` You are photographed any time you go into a bank, any time you go through a toll booth on the turnpike and in many retail establishments and condo buildings. I do n't see this as being any different.'' The proposal would place cameras on four bridges and on the town's approach on Highway A1A from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Smoking Bans In Jail Proposed In Two More Counties In Michigan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Future inmates at the <LOCATION> Muskegon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> county jails may have to give up more than their freedom to pay their debts to society. They may also lose their cigarettes. `` People in jail give up quite a bit,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehfield </PERSON>, medical director in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where a committee has recommended a cigarette ban in the jail and other county buildings. `` Smoking certainly can be part of that.'' In <LOCATION> Muskegon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the sheriff's department has proposed that the county council make the entire department and jail smoke free May 1, said Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, jail administrator. `` It is not going to be easy for anyone,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, estimating that more than half the inmates smoke. The <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Muskegon </LOCATION> county proposals are inspired in part by an experimental ban begun six weeks ago at the Grand Traverse County jail. Officials in the two counties are monitoring that program before deciding whether to approve their own. Some officials are concerned a smoking ban could trigger more tension in the overcrowded jail system. `` We are thinking about issuing hard candy with dinner,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` We might also put a popcorn machine in for the evenings. That might take the edge off of it.'' <LOCATION> Muskegon </LOCATION> officials also plan to offer stop-smoking classes to inmates and employees.

 About 100 students at <ORGANIZATION> Colby-Sawyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> sat in Thursday at the administration building, singing `` I Am Woman,'' to protest the possible admission of men. The protest gave way after about four hours to an emotional meeting between the students, nearly one-quarter of the school's roughly 450 enrollment, and two administrators `` This institution runs because of our money. We should be put on the task force'' studying coeducation, one student told President <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Trustee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> at the meeting. `` We deserve that.'' In addition, the students asked Stock to scrap separate meetings scheduled with staff, administrators and students in favor of a campuswide meeting, and to delay by a month the April 1 trustees' vote on admitting men Students complained that coeducation has been discussed, partly in response to the prospect of a dwindling applicant pool, since October, but that students learned of it only recently. Students, one told <PERSON> Stock </PERSON>, feel `` segregated and manipulated.'' Stock and <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> responded that the administration has not meant to keep anyone in the dark. `` There's been no effort at all to divide and conquer. Rather, just the opposite _ to let everyone know at the time we know,'' <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said. The liberal arts school has been all-women for more than 60 years. The school traces its roots to a small academy chartered in 1837.

<HEAD>This May be the Year for Acid-Rain Legislation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, spurred on by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise to do something this year about acid rain, is beginning what could be the final confrontation in an eight-year, multi-million dollar lobbying war over clean air The opening volley was fired Thursday when more than 100 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, most allied with environmental groups, introduced legislation to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 40 percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by about half that amount. The gases are the two major components of acid rain. The bill drew expected, strong support from environmental groups, but was quickly opposed by the coal, auto and electric utilities industries, which have fought environmentalists to an expensive draw since the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration took office in 1981. `` This is the year for clean air,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., a sponsor of the legislation along with Reps. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, He cited the `` new attitude'' of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> compared to that of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and `` increased public awareness and concern about our environment.'' Environmental groups cite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise to solve the acid rain problem, made during a trip to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> last month, as one of two political developments that signal the battle may be near an end. The other is the levation to majority leader of Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, who sponsored last year's clean-air legislation in that chamber. `` For industry, I think they know the ` no-bill' option is pretty well off the table,'' said <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a private environmental lobbying organization. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>, senior <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> represenative of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged, `` The pressures for doing something this year are considerably more than they were last year.'' But <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> said `` we seem to be charging down a path that is driven by what we've learned in the early years'' about acid rain, and `` not what we're about to learn'' from a 10-year federal study scheduled for completion in mid-1990. He suggested the nation wait for the study, a recommendation that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> supported but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gayla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the nation's largest coal producer, <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said her company `` is opposed to additional controls beyond those already in place in the Clean Air Act.'' And <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smiroldo </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, representing the nation's electric utilities, said that `` the current Clean Air Act is working'' and that `` any legislation at this point is premature.'' Acid rain and another aspect of the clean air debate _ dirty air caused by ozone and carbon monoxide _ have been among the most heavily lobbied issues in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. According to records on file in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sensible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rain </ORGANIZATION> was the top lobbying spender in 1986. The organization, bankrolled principally by electric utilities and coal companies, spent $ 3,028,235 on behalf of a grassroots direct mail campaign opposing legislation mandating stricter acid rain emissions. Acid rain legislation did not get near the floor that year. But that figure did not include spending by individual automakers, lectric utilities and chemical and coal companies and their trade associations, according to Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. She said environmental lobbying groups spent only a fraction of industry expenditures. The industry groups also have had strong allies in Congress: the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> chairman, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., and the former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W The House bill would require that sulfur dioxide emissions be reduced by 10 million tons and nitrogen oxide emissions by 4 million tons by 1998. Currently, an estimated 22 million tons of sulfur dioxide and 21 million tons of nitrogen oxide are being emitted into the air. The two gases are converted in the atmosphere into acids, which travel far from their starting points to pollute lakes and forests and, according to some health experts, cause serious respiratory problems for asthmatics, children and the elderly. The leading sources of sulfur dioxide are coal-burning electric power plants and industrial facilities. Nitrogen oxides are emitted in approximately equal amounts by motor vehicles and industry. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been divided along regional lines. The Northeast, the primary victim of acid rain, wants immediate action. Midwestern states, with many older, coal-fired power plants, fear controls that will boost electric bills. States that produce large amonts of high-sulfur coal _ <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ worry that controls will cause massive job losses in the coal industry. The West, where low-sulfur coal is mined and acid rain is not a serious problem, is reluctant to pay the cost for new controls. Under the new House bill: _ <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> utilities would receive federal subsidies to protect residential customers from rate hikes of more than 10 percent as a result of the sulfur dioxide controls _ Motor vehicle manufacturers would be required to tighten tailpipe standards for nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons _ The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> would be required to control hydrocarbon vapors by requiring onboard vehicle canisters or controls at the gas pump <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> said the canisters are unsafe, and could cause fires in crashes, in hot weather, and if a leak develops in the emissions system.

 The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted unanimously today to approve the nomination of <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> as the No. 2 man at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, ending a controversy over his ties to former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s international consulting firm The 19-0 vote came after <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, who earned more than $ 900,000 last year as president of <ORGANIZATION> Kissinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to voluntarily disqualify himself from all matters involving former clients of the firm during his government service. But <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> was not been required to divulge the names of those clients to the committee, a move sought by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, R-N.C. Several senators pointed out that such a request put the nominee in the position of making disclosures beyond those required under the Ethics in Government Act. The nomination now goes to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to approve <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> as undersecretary of state on Friday.

That's why <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> got well over a million dollars,'' the senator said <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> brought up the difficulties encountered by former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> in his recent failed attempt to become defense secretary due in part to his financial ties to defense contractors. `` I wish he had an opportunity to answer questions in public about his income,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. `` He was n't allowed to defend himself'' against many of the allegations. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, a staunch conservative, also has been critical for years of <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s conduct of foreign policy, especially moves toward closer relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administrations. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> has asked <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> ade, to turn over a confidential list of all of the clients of <ORGANIZATION> Kissinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, even though <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> may not have worked for all of the clients during his four years with the New York-based consulting firm. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, told the committee that if pressed they would comply with the request but believed it set a poor precedent. `` Mr. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> are prepared to comply,'' said <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>. `` But it's an open door the committee could push through if they like.'' <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> contended that such a broad request would make it difficult for any person who had served in the private sector to enter government service. The attorney pointed out that <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> has cut all ties with <ORGANIZATION> Kissinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, sold all his stock and offered to disqualify himself for a period of one year from any dealings involving any of the clients he served while with the firm. Sens. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan., and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., objected to <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' line of `` You ca n't design something that will fit all situations,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> said, pointing out that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have to keep in mind common sense and good judgment,'' she said, speaking of problems of conflict of interest. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> who has filed financial disclosure forms showing he made $ 915,000 last year while working as the president of the firm, testified Wednesday that he has cut all ties with the firm and an affiliate, <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> also said he had sold all his investment stocks. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> received numerous plaudits for his years at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, including service as ambassador to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and undersecretary of State. But most questions centered on his contacts with the international clients of <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s firm. `` I'd rather be safe than sorry ... and right now, I do n't know what the facts are,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> argued in asking for the list of clients. The senator promised the list would be held in confidence, saying, `` I do n't think anybody on this committee would leak one word of this.'' If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> does not act this week, the nomination could be delayed for several weeks, because members leave Friday for a two-week Easter recess. Several senators on the panel called for timely action on the nomination, given the dearth of confirmed officials in the upper levels of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> testified that he had provided the committee with a list of the clients he had personally dealt while with at the firm and a description of his work for them in a `` generic sense.'' But he said he was prevented from disclosing additional information under the firm's confidentiality contract with its clients. The firms include such concerns as <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, H.J. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, and the Italian car maker <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.p.a. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, A.B. <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. He also testified that under advice from the Office of Government Ethics, he would disqualify himself for a period of one year from any future matters at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> involving the clients he worked with while with the firms. `` There will be no conflicts of interest because I have no outside interests,'' <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said. He also argued that his step to disqualify himself for the one-year period on all matters involving former clients was voluntary and went beyond the requirements of the Ethics in Government Act, which he said only required a recusal case-by-case. But given the current climate on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in the wake of the intense scrutiny of Tower over his failed nomination to head the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> was queried during his initial hearing about everything from his 30 years in government service to his personal habits. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, apparently in jest, even asked <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> at one point, `` Have you ever, in public or private, pinched a woman's behind?'' The room erupted in nervous laughter, with <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> responding in the negative.

 Israeli teen-agers are playing a form of Russian roulette that involves dodging speeding cars in an apparent attempt to share the dangers faced by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, an official said Thursday. The game, which has swept the country in epidemic form, appears in different versions nationwide, said <PERSON> Shai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadish </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s Road Safety Unit. Teen-agers either lie in the path of an approaching car and wait until the last moment to scamper away or leave school bags in the middle of the road, darting out to snatch them from oncoming cars, <PERSON> Gadish </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The Education and Transportation ministries have sent psychologists to high schools in an attempt to discover why the dangerous game is so popular, he said. <PERSON> Gadish </PERSON> said teen-agers hear about the brave deeds of older friends and brothers in the army. `` They want to imitate them by exhibiting their own courage ... by endangering their own lives,'' he said. Israelis are drafted into the army on their 18th birthday. Men serve for three years and women for two. `` We live in a society where you need to show courage,'' <PERSON> Gadish </PERSON> said. `` These youths know it's dangerous in the streets and that they can show their bravery there.'' Only one youth has been slightly injured playing the game, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Gadish </PERSON> said teens usually play the game on their way home from school, and high school principals have asked parents to discourage their children from participating. `` We are worried that the more publicity this game of Russian roulette in the streets receives, the more popular it will become,'' said <PERSON> Atniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneller </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>US Agencies Say Apples Safe for Kids</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three federal agencies proclaimed today that apples are safe for children to eat, attempting to calm fears about a chemical used by some growers that has been linked to cancer and claims that preschoolers are especially vulnerable. `` The federal government believes that it is safe for Americans to eat apples,'' said a joint statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The agencies said there is no `` imminent hazard posed to children'' by the consumption of apples. At a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> noted that he moved swiftly to raise concerns about fruit imported from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> after traces of cyanide were found in two grapes. He declared he would do the same if he thought apples were dangerous for children. There has been growing concern among parents and school officials about whether children should continue eating apples and apple products until questions about the health questions. At the center of the controversy is the chemical daminozide, sold under the trade name Alar, which the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said has caused cancer in test animals. Last month a private environmental group issued a report suggesting that children are especially at risk from Alar because they consumer many times more apples and apple products, compared to their weight, than adults. School systems in a number of cities including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> have stopped providing children apples after the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was made public and the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> program `` 60 Minutes'' reported on the controversy. In a statement, the three federal agencies said: `` The federal government encourages school systems and other responsible for the diets of children to continue to serve apples and other nutritious fruit to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children.'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the reaction to claims that young children are exposed to a dangerous levels of Alar in apples has caused a `` panic'' that is not warranted. He said there is `` not a signficant risk at this time facing the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people in the consumption of apples.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, acting deputy <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on children, families, drugs and alcoholism that while the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has conclude that daminozide causes cancer, its continued use does not pose a threat that would warrant the chemical being ordered immediately off the market. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> in his testimony criticized the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> study's risk estimates as not being `` scientifically sound'' and said the report has caused `` misinformation and fear'' to dominate the debate. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said if daminozide were a newly introduced pesticide it would not be approved. Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., suggested that the manufacturer of Alar `` would do us all a public service if they suspended production of the product'' because the controversy is harming the apple industry <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said most growers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state do not use daminozide, but there was no agreement among witnesses as to how widespread the use of the chemical actually is. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that about 10 percent of the apples are sprayed with Alar, but the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has cited a figure of about 5 percent. Consumer groups have claimed that spot checks have shown a use as high as 30 percent. Several senators said the controversy is threatening the apple industry. `` The apple market is dead as a doornail right now across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, whose family owns an apple orchard.

<TEXT>
 A police officer who was acquitted last summer of sexually abusing a 6-year-old girl was charged Thursday with raping the same child, after police allegedly found a tape of the crime in his apartment. Patrolman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, 45, was acquitted in June when the girl, placed on the witness stand in front of the defendant, recanted her story of abuse. Several months later, however, the girl told police that <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> had molested her again. After obtaining a search warrant, police raided <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>'s apartment Wednesday and confiscated a videotape that prosecutors said shows the policeman having sex with the girl. <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, who was suspended without pay after the raid, pleaded innocent at arraignment in <ORGANIZATION> Lynn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dever </PERSON> set bail at $ 350,000 with double surety, meaning <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> must put up bonds worth at least $ 700,000 to secure his release. <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Karahalis </PERSON>, did not respond to telephone messages requesting comment. <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, a divorced father of six children, has served for 14 years on the police force in <LOCATION> Lynn </LOCATION>, a industrial city of 78,500 people about 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. During his trial last summer, the child talked about visits to <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>'s apartment on weekends but did not accuse him of any sexual misconduct. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, said the girl had previously given investigators a detailed account of abuse but `` froze up'' on the witness stand.

 A surfer bitten by a shark at a public beach has lost a lawsuit against the county in which he charged that as in the movie `` Jaws'' authorities failed to warn bathers because of a holiday weekend. A jury deliberated 77 minutes Wednesday before rejecting a $ 63,000 claim by <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Popper </PERSON> against <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> over a leg injury he received in the May 21, 1983, attack. <PERSON> Popper </PERSON>, 22 when he was bitten, had argued that sharks were sighted off <LOCATION> Haulover </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> in the days prior to his attack, but no warning was issued, even though lifeguards commonly post signs advising of dangerous currents and poisonous jellyfish. `` Why would <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> make the decision to expose people to sharks rather than expose sharks to people?'' <PERSON> Popper </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothlein </PERSON> said in his summary. `` There can be only one reason _ there was a holiday weekend coming up and sharks are bad for buisiness.'' Assistant county attorney <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> called those arguments absurd. `` As this trial went on, it became apparent these men were trying to orchestrate the sequel to `` Jaws,'' <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today challenged charges that his administration is adrift, saying he is trying to defuse `` ticking time bombs'' while charting an agenda for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the next century. `` In this kind of work, more is going on than meets the eye _ or makes the headlines,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In a state where savings and loan failures have become regular events, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prodded <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to move quickly on his three-week-old plan to save the beleagured industry. `` There's no excuse for further delay,'' he said. `` The essential question today is, ` What are we doing to prepare for the new world that begins 11 short years from now?'' he said. `` That's what my agenda is all about.'' In his first trip West since his inauguration Jan. 20, the president flew to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> for a pair of speeches. His first stop was in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> for a luncheon appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which bills itself as a nonpartisan educational institution. Next, he was flying to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, to address the <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Achievement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. In the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> appearance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ticked off a series of initiatives from his new administration: a spending and deficit-reduction plan, a program to relieve Third World debt, a proposal to rescue the savings and loan industry and an increase in the minimum wage. On the savings and loan crisis, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> again assured depositors that their savings are safe. `` They are fully protected and will continue to be fully protected,'' he said. In recent months, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L customers have been withdrawing deposits at a record rate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the S & amp; L industry must be cleaned up `` so that the questionable ractices and outright illegalities that caused the current crisis wo n't happen again.'' Moreover, he said, `` We must see to it that those S & amp; L officials guilty of criminal actions are pursued and punished for the losses they have caused.'' `` These are serious challenges _ ticking time bombs that we need to defuse without delay,'' he said. `` And we're doing just that. `` But these are by no means the only issues that demand leadership and prompt action. We're entering the 1990s _ a horizon decade, threshold to a new century.'' He said that `` building a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> means laying the foundations today for the kind of future we want.'' Along those lines, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs to take steps to safeguard the environment against short-sighted actions that do long-term damage. `` It means finding ways to preserve and strengthen indispensable institutions like the family in the midst of social change,'' he said. `` It means taking a long-range look at the international landscape to determine what policies and approaches will keep us free, prosperous and at peace in the 21st century, as we are today. `` And speaking of freedom, it means formulating a multi-source energy policy that, in the long run, will make us less dependent on foreign oil,'' the president, a former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman, said in this petroleum-oriented city. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the nation must invest in its own economy with new incentives for business, including catalysts for research and development. He called anew for a reduction in the capital gains tax. In addition, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the nation must encourage and improve education. `` We are n't going to clean up the environment, turn our education system around or create a more responsive business climate in a single day,'' he said. `` But if we begin today and make steady progress, we will succeed. `` In this kind of work,'' he said, `` more is going on than meets the eye, or makes the headlines. The proof will come when we look back from the year 2000.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was warmly applauded by the audience of more than 1,000 people when he raised the controversial subject of restrictions on military-style assault weapons. `` I do want to find the solution to the so-called AK-47 assault weapon problem, one that protects the rights of the legitimate sportsman but also protects the lives of our police officers, who are laying their lives on the line,'' he said. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> applauded the decision of <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to suspend sales of its popular AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. Asked if other industries should follow suit, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration would stand pat for now. In recent speeches, the president has been emphasizing his actions thus far, including proposals for rescuing the savings and loan industry, relieving Third World debt, cutting the deficit and combating the problems of drugs, the environment and child care. `` Let us recognize that we stand at a special moment in our history,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a speech Wednesday night before the <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an industry trade group. `` It is a moment not for complacency, not to sit back and reflect upon what has been but to reflect upon what might be.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has established four objectives: to reduce the deficit, invest in the nation's future, confront problems that can not wait and avoid imposing new taxes. `` These four objectives will build on the progress of the last eight years. They will build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` They will reaffirm our strengths, defuse ticking time bombs and reorient us as a nation.'' Today's speech came amid skepticism from Democrats that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration can reach a quick agreement on a new spending plan. Neither side has been willing to propose either new taxes or new spending cuts to reduce the deficit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said a recent poll of corporate leaders found they believe Americans are too short-term oriented. `` My plan speaks to the long term, and to a stable business climate,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It says that to remain competitive, we must look beyond the next quarterly statement.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used the occasion to underscore his request for a cut in the capital gains tax to 15 percent, saying that `` nothing could make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> more competitive.'' A congressional study released this week said that 80 percent of the benefits from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed capital gains tax cut would go to Americans making more than $ 100,000 a year.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has increased its military presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> since the Iran-Iraq cease-fire, despite publicly urging withdrawal of foreign navies from the region, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military official said Thursday. Gen. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the gulf, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> navy continues escorting that nation's tankers while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other navies have scaled back escort operations. `` I see no withdrawal of the Soviets in this area,'' <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON> told reporters. `` As a matter of fact ... I see an increase in their diplomatic initiatives ... and their military assistance initiatives.'' <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON> said there has been a gradual reduction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the gulf since an Aug. 20 cease-fire halted fighting in the eight-year war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval force in the gulf and the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> now consists of 23 ships and will soon be cut to 19, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON> said the unit, which has operated in the gulf since 1949, would wind up slightly larger than the six ships in the region before mid-1987 when forces were boosted to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipping during the escalating war. <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON> said Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on a recent regional tour, did not honestly state the number of Soviet ships in the gulf. `` I will tell you, without going into details, that his mathematics are very bad, compared to what we've seen here,'' <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources say the Soviets maintain seven to nine ships in and near the gulf, including missile frigates and destroyers. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there has been no significant change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> force since the gulf war truce. `` The Soviets now have a permanent presence in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, that they've never had before,'' <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON> said. `` They have a very heavy presence of forces in the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, which, of course, Mr. <PERSON> Schevardnadze </PERSON> did n't talk about.'' He said the Soviets also had `` an overwhelming number of military advisers and military men'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> _ the only communist regime in the Arab world _ in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and other countries, and have `` a very large troop presence'' just north of the Soviet-Iran border.

 An adult's right to refuse medical treatment in the face of death was upheld Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a case involving a <ORGANIZATION> Jehovah </ORGANIZATION>'s Witness who was forced to accept blood transfusions. Privacy rights and religious freedom supersede the medical profession's interest in saving lives, the justices ruled 6-1. The court, noting the woman did not want to die, said its ruling was not condoning suicide. The decision was a victory for <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Wons </PERSON>, who sought care for uterine bleeding in April 1986. Doctors said she was lapsing in and out of consciousness and death was imminent at the time. While still conscious, she fought against receiving transfusions because <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses believe it defies a biblical passage in <LOCATION> Leviticus </LOCATION>, `` Whatsoever man ... eats any manner of blood, I will cut him off from among his people.'' A court in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> ordered doctors at the county-run <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> to perform transfusions. Mrs. <PERSON> Wons </PERSON> regained consciousness and continued her court battle. Her attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelner </PERSON>, said the bleeding is likely to recur. `` That is one of the things that made the issue not moot with the court,'' said <PERSON> Kelner </PERSON>. `` She has expressed her preference in writing that should she suffer from it again, she be allowed to ... refuse transfusions.'' Hospital officials, represented by the hospital's <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>, said letting Mrs. Wons die would leave her two children without proper nurturing. Mrs. <PERSON> Wons </PERSON>, 41, argued that her husband supported her decision and the children would be cared by him, his mother and brothers. The high court said Mrs. Wons' was n't necessarily ignoring the best interest of her children and should n't be viewed as returning to a normal life after having been forced to commit a sin against religious laws. Her death may have been necessary to ensure her spiritual life, Chief Justice <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON> wrote in a separate opinion agreeing with the majority. `` As a parent, ... she also must consider the example she sets for her children, how to teach them to follow what she believes is God's law if she herself does not. The choice for her can not be an easy one, but it is hers to make,'' <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON> wrote. Justice <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Overton </PERSON>, in the sole dissent, said Mrs. Wons' death would have been unnecessary and guessed the court would have surprised one of the framers of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution. `` To justify, as a right of the free exercise of religion, a parent's right to abandon a minor child through a death which is totally unecessary is, in my view, neither a reasonable nor a logical interpretation of the First Amendment,'' wrote <PERSON> Overton </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> would not believe that his ` free exercise' clause could ever be interpreted in this manner.''

<HEAD>Hill Negotiators Detect Move Toward Compromise with Administration</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional negotiators on the federal budget said Thursday they detected a move toward compromise with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on which taxes should be raised. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recommended $ 1.16 trillion budget for fiscal 1990, which opens Oct. 1, proposed to bring in about $ 14 billion through higher taxes, fees for government services, and sales of government assets. The White House contends its specific proposals do n't violate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` no new taxes'' campaign pledge. Lawmakers said there was little chance of enactment for many of the president's tax proposals, such as expanding the Medicare tax to all state and local employees and cutting the capital-gains tax rate. `` I think they recognize the problem that the revenues that are presented right now, that there's some difficulty in achieving those,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> But it was important that the overall total of $ 14 billion still be raised, he said. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> and other congressional budget-writers met Thursday with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, and the senior members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' tax-writing committees. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the Democrats were not proposing to raise more money than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed. `` I think they understand revenues are needed and they've outlined a number of revenues,'' he said `` My message was whatever we do has to be credible, that we have to show the financial markets that we've seriously addressed the problem'' of the deficit. `` Yes, I think there is some movement,'' he said, when asked if progress was made in the meeting. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> declined to answer reporters' questions. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said there was no change in the administration's position but he did not want to comment on what the lawmakers said. The Gramm-Rudman law mandates that the federal deficit, which is expected to exceed $ 163 billion this year, be reduced to $ 100 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, in a breakfast speech at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said the scope of the budget talks would be limited by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s willingness or unwillingness to discuss raising taxes. He said taxes needed to be raised and spending cut to produce a serious deficit-reduction plan. With the budget negotiators looking for places to cut spending, pressure continued to increase spending. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> by voice vote approved a recommendation that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adopt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to increase military spending next year to keep pace with inflation, and boost it 1 percent above inflation the next two years. Rep. Rep. G.V. `` Sonny'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget task force that spending on veterans' health programs must increase faster than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing `` What the budget committee decides in the next few weeks will probably be long remembered,'' he said, citing a crisis in the system and the contribution he said the programs make to the nation's defense. `` So if we must delay the procurement of one or two bombers in order to insure that our veterans receive needed health care, then we must do it. It's an easy choice for me,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jewish Groups Calls for Boycott of Meetings with Pope</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish groups are calling on Jews around the world to boycott meetings with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> because the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has failed to remove a convent from the site of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, the World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> section of the World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 34 American groups, adopted a resolution that calls for <ORGANIZATION> WJC </ORGANIZATION> members in 70 countries to refrain from meetings with the pope during his frequent travels. The resolution, adopted at a meeting of organization leaders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, will be introduced at the May 7 meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> WJC </ORGANIZATION>'s International Executive in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> The resolution said the boycott call was `` an expression of anguish and moral distress'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to comply with a 1987 agreement that would remove the Carmelite convent to grounds outside the extermination camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` The convent controversy is symptomatic of a clear pattern by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to revise the history of the Holocaust and the role of the church during that terrible period,'' the resolution said. Pope <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> XII </PERSON> has been widely criticized for failing to act or speak out against the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' murder of 6 million Jews during World War II. The clash over the convent comes at a time of increasing tensions between the world Jewish community and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Nobel laureate <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON>, a Holocaust survivor and author, recently accused Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of trying to `` de-Judaize'' the Holocaust by ignoring Jewish suffering in speeches and comments about that era. Jewish groups are also angry that the pope has met twice in the last three years with Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who has been accused of complicity in Nazi atrocities. The convent at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> was established in 1984 by a dozen Carmelite nuns in a building the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> had used to store poison gas canisters. That action set of a storm of international protest from Jews who wanted the camp site left undisturbed as a memorial to its victims. Jewish and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders met in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1987 and agreed that the convent would be removed by Feb. 22, 1989. The church undertook, in writing, to move the nuns to nearby grounds outside the camp so they could continue their educational activities about the Holocaust. In recent months, <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials have said a site had been chosen for the new convent. One cleric said work on the building would soon be completed, but a <ORGANIZATION> WJC </ORGANIZATION> delegation that visited the area in January said it had found no construction at all.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Sags After Mild-Weather Surge in January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Housing construction plummeted 11.4 percent in February, the government reported Thursday, with analysts blaming the sharp decline on harsher weather last month and the bite of higher mortgage interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.5 million units last month as the weather turned cold again after an unseasonably mild January. February's pace was down from a rate of 1.69 million units in January, the highest level in nearly two years. Analysts said a longer-term slowdown in the housing market is being caused by the steady upward climb of interest rates. `` We do n't expect housing to suddenly fall off the cliff this year, but we do expect it to progressively weaken with higher interest rates,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Interest on fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.86 percent last week, up from 9.84 percent a year earlier, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Initial rates on adjustable-rate mortgages were up even more sharply, with the starting rate on a one-year ARM averaging 8.93 percent last week, up from 7.53 percent a year earlier. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Colton </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homebuilders </ORGANIZATION>, said rising interest rates were the `` dominant factor'' behind the association's forecast for a 7 percent slowdown in housing construction this year. An increase of 1 percent in the interest charged on a $ 100,000 mortgage adds $ 62 a month to a homeowner's payments, <PERSON> Colton </PERSON> said. `` That has a big impact on affordability,'' he said. Housing construction reached a post-recession peak in 1986, when 1.81 million units were built, then began sliding. Last year, the level was 1.49 million units. Single-family homes were built in February at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.05 million units, down 13.1 percent from the pace in the previous month and the biggest drop in five years. Apartment construction, meanwhile, was down 7.2 percent in February to an annual rate of 453,000 units. Construction of multifamily housing peaked in 1985 and then began a sharp slide, largely the result of changes in the tax code that made such projects less attractive to investors. <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> said recent data on apartment construction have been more encouraging, suggesting that `` the depressing effects of tax reform and overbuilding may be behind us now.'' Housing permits, a bellwether of future housing activity, fell 6.8 percent last month to a rate of 1.4 million units after dropping 3.8 percent during January. February's decline in permits was the biggest drop since a 9 percent fall in January 1988. `` The building permits data for both months suggest that rising rates have taken a greater toll on housing than is suggested by the starts numbers,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for a year has been nudging interest rates upward in an effort to slow the economy and restrain inflation. Most analysts expect interest rates to peak at mid-year and then gradually decline again. <PERSON> Colton </PERSON>, of the homebuilders, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been reacting to `` inflation paranoia'' and risks driving the country into a recession by pushing interest rates too high. `` We think that at a minimum the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> needs to be very careful,'' <PERSON> Colton </PERSON> said. Housing activity dropped last month in all four regions of the country, with the biggest decline in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where starts fell 22.6 percent to 229,000 units after surging 47 percent in January. Construction was down 13.7 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to 277,000 units, and fell 8.7 percent in the West to 400,000 units. In the South, starts were down 6.8 percent to 592,000.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders today adopted a sweeping reform program for the inefficient Soviet agricultural system that they hope will end chronic food shortages. The plan, adopted by the plenary meeting of the party's 300-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, would give the nation's farmers the right to lease state-owned land for life However, it would also maintain the network of state and collective farms that have chronically failed to feed the Soviet people. The party also elected its 100 members to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, a new legislative body that will meet for the first time this spring. Among them was President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The plenum acted after debating <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan to give farmers long-term leases on state-owned land to make them more attentive and efficient. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also says farmers should be given freedom to decide what to plant on that land, rather than having that decided by the bureaucracy. Politburo member <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> told a news conference the leases could be signed for any period of more than five years and be passed on to succeeding generations of farmers. He said no one would be forced into leasing land. He also said the giant state and collective farms would remain the backbone of the Soviet agricultural system. `` Radical changes in rural life and production relations should be carried out on a purely voluntary basis ... without any kind of force or repressive methods,'' <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said in his first appearance before foreign reporters. Setting targets for leasing would only encourage strong-arm tactics to fulfill the plans, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> is the Politburo member in charge of farm policy and is widely regarded as a conservative force on the Politburo. Before the plenum he spoke out for including leasing in a wide variety of methods to improve agricultural production. He said the approach to agriculture will include leasing, self-financing and greater democracy in rural life. The plenum abolished the giant `` Gosagroprom'' superministry in charge of agricultural policy, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> interrupted its chief, <PERSON> Vsevolod </PERSON> <PERSON> Murakovsky </PERSON> who spoke out in favor of continuing the system in which all local regions are required to send a percentage of their harvest to central authorities. Showing his impatience with domination of local producers by the central bureaucracy, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> interrupted again when another speaker brought up the issue of the government orders. In a speech on Wednesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> painted a bleak picture of Soviet agriculture, with chemically despoiled land, deliberate destruction of sound system prevalent in the 1920s, and massive investments gone sour. The situation is so bad that it will be years before the country can feed itself, he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s detailed report on years of failed reforms made it clear that he believes nothing less than radical change will free Soviets from rationing of meat and cheese now found in many cities. His proposal to abolish a government superagency created in 1985 to oversee the country's farm sector was a tacit acknowledgement of the failure of even his early attempts to revitalize agriculture.

 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday his agency has substantially stepped up its efforts to combat telemarketing fraud. <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that the commission `` fully supports the objectives'' of legislation intended to bring greater state resources to bear on telemarketing fraud. `` It is estimated that consumers may lose over a billion dollars a year to telemarketing scam artists,'' he said. `` Recognizing this threat, the commission has greatly increased its enforcement efforts in this area in recent years.'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> testified that, since 1982, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has opened more than 80 investigations of telemarketers and has brought 33 fraud cases in federal court. `` In these cases, the commission obtained injunctions against companies having aggregate sales of over $ 628 million,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials, said that `` a combined federal, state and private attack on telemarketing fraud will bring quicker and more effective enforcement, save scarce federal dollars and provide for more uniformity in enforcement.'' He noted that in fiscal 1983 the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> spent about $ 410,000 on telemarketing cases. This rose to $ 2.3 million in fiscal 1988, and the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has told the panel that its staff expects to spend $ 4.8 million on telemarketing investigations this fiscal year. Also testifying at Thursday's hearing was <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who said that `` boiler room telemarketing is a difficult problem for state law enforcement. These operators are cheap and mobile. A boiler room essentially requires only leased office space and a leased telephone.'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> `` has been a center for boiler room activity. Over 50 percent of all complaints received by the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Consumer Affairs Division in 1987 concerned telemarketing. In 1988, over 54 percent of complaints were related to telemarketing.''

 Discovery's astronauts took a call from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and read the first home-delivered newspaper in space Thursday before tending to more routine tasks such as checking on chicken eggs and photographing the Earth. The space shuttle crew began its fourth day in space trouble-free and under full electrical power after <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineers on Wednesday fixed a problem with a hydrogen tank that had threatened to shorten the mission. In a television-telephone hookup linking the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the shuttle, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised the astronauts' work and pledged continued support of the space program. `` It is an inspiration to the Americans, I'll tell you, all of us. Today's pioneers,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who could see the astronauts in the shuttle cabin. And after Discovery commander <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> told the president the crew was flying something for the new first lady, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` She'll be thrilled. You better come up here and give it to her personally. `` You're invited right as of now. So when you get back, head this way,'' the president added. The astronauts also told the president about the powerful IMAX, a 70mm camera being used to shoot environmentally damaged parts of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> while flying upside down 180 miles high. Pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> said the crew was `` getting a lot of great film that will show a lot of people around the world how fragile the planet <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is in this big vastness of space and maybe help everybody to work to improve that.'' Camera targets included a coral reef being destroyed by pollution off east <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, areas of deforestation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, an active volcano in <LOCATION> Guatamala </LOCATION> and scars left by fires in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> and the forests of the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There's so much interest today on the global environment and I think a lot of people will see just from your important mission the contribution that space exploration can make to the world's environment,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said The astronauts also got the chance to read the newspaper when ground controllers used a facsimile machine to send up a copy of the front page of The Roundup, an employee weekly at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` We wanted to tell you that's the first newspaper that's been sent to an American spacecraft,'' capsule communicator <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Thuot </PERSON> told the crew. The issue, which will not be distributed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> until Friday, carried a lead story on the Discovery's fiery liftoff Monday and a report about a welcome-home ceremony the space center planned for the crew. Discovery is scheduled to land Saturday morning at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Thursday began with a twist when the Discovery crew pre-empted <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>'s usual wake-up call by radioing the theme music from `` Star Trek'' to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> Then, the recorded voice of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON>, who played Capt. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> in television series and movies, sent congratulations to <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` Discovery,'' responded a Mission Control communicator, `` tell <PERSON> Scotty </PERSON> to beam me up.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>'s official wake up call was a medley of school songs from the crew's alma maters. The tape included `` Anchor's Aweigh'' for <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> graduates Coats, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>; `` Wild Blue Yonder'' for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> graduate <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fight song for Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON>, a physician who earned a bachelor's degree from the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> school <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> later checked a student's chicken embryo experiment, designed to determine whether the 32 fertilized eggs can develop normally in weightlessness. While <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> pulled the incubator from a locker, student <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vellinger </PERSON> watched him on a television monitor from <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` Let him know it's working really great,'' <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> said. Another student experiment involved four rats, who each had a leg cut shortly before launch and will be killed after landing. It is designed to test the effects of zero gravity on bone healing in space. The mission's main goal was accomplished Monday when the crew deployed a $ 100 million communications satellite that completes a network <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will use to link communications with shuttles and other satellites. Discovery, the first of seven planned shuttle missions this year, is the third since <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> resumed manned flights following the Challenger explosion.

 An Army report obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> says pesticide pollution at the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION> is harming and killing wildlife, and posing a threat to humans who may eat the tainted game. The report was based on a three-year study of the pollution's effect on animals and plants at the 27-square mile superfund cleanup site north of <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the newspaper said in Thursday's editions The report probably will determine the extent of the cleanup at the site, a federal official said Wednesday.

The Army manufactured chemical weapons at the facility from 1942 through the 1960s. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> leased a portion of the arsenal for pesticide production through the early 1980s. Waste from both operations are known to have polluted groundwater, surface water and soil at the facility. Use of the old arsenal has been a subject of controversy. Federal and state officials, including Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>, have suggested turning the land into a park or wildlife preserve. Health officials have warned, however, that extensive cleanup work must be completed in order for the animals to survive. If contaminated water and soil are left untreated, pollutants will continue to be absorbed by plants, ingested by insects and carried up the food chain to large game animals, they say. `` If they continue to eat in contaminated areas, the problem is only going to worsen,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Edson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s project manager at the arsenal said Wednesday the report will have an impact. `` It looks like the study might drive the decisions regarding how clean it must be made,'' said <PERSON> Connally </PERSON> <PERSON> Mears </PERSON>. `` We'll pay particular attention to the implications from the study to determine what needs to be done to ensure protection of both public health and the environment.'' Army spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> said Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> did n't want to comment because the report was still in draft form.

<HEAD>Victims with Lawyers Claim More Injuries, Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Auto accident victims with lawyers claim more neck and back injuries than those without legal assistance, an insurance industry study reported Thursday in speculating that lawyers drive up insurance costs. The study also said that, on average, one out of six accident victims hiring lawyers was steered to a particular doctor or clinic by the lawyer, and said that people represented by lawyers hire substantially more chiropractors, physical therapists and psychotherapists. The findings came from a study of 46,694 injury claims paid by 34 insurance companies in the spring and summer of 1987. Those companies sell nearly 60 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto insurance. The claims were made under five coverages: bodily injury liability, uninsured and underinsured motorists, personal injury protection and medical payment. `` States with high attorney involvement tend to have high auto injury costs, and states with low attorney involvement tend to have low auto injury costs,'' said the study conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> All-Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a group of insurance industry trade associations and companies. At the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, whose members are plaintiff attorneys in personal injury cases, spokeswoman <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Applebaum </PERSON> said no one had seen the study and she could not comment. The insurance group found that almost 45 percent of claimants hired lawyers, up from more than 31 percent in 1977. The group speculated that the ending of restrictions on advertising by lawyers in 1978 might have helped cause the increase. The average bodily injury claim payment increased 139 percent in those 10 years, well ahead of the 85 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index. After noting a 124 percent increase in the cost of medical care, the study said, `` Another possible reason for the large incurease in auto injury costs is that attorney involvement has increased 42 percent since 1977.''

<TEXT>
 Biologists stalking a 35-foot <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whale lost the migrating beast in fog before they could cut away a tangle of fishing nets that could kill it, officials said Thursday. The northbound whale was spotted Tuesday off <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Point </PERSON> with netting wrapped around its flukes. Wildlife experts fear it will eventually drown, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't know how much netting is trailing underwater. Eventually, the whale will probably tire out and die,'' said <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>. Biologists participating in the rescue estimated the whale was trailing about 70 feet of netting. A team of biologists from the Long Beach-based <ORGANIZATION> Whale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> followed the whale from <LOCATION> Dana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cove </LOCATION> area off <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, trying several times to get close and cut away the nets. They lost it in fog near <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, 45 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The whale is moving at a pretty good clip and the rescuers could n't catch up with it,'' said <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>. Agent <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Sautter </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said it was extremely difficult to catch a whale moving in the water. `` By the time you get a small boat over there they go down again,'' <PERSON> Sautter </PERSON> said. `` It also stresses the animal and it may do more harm than good.'' Another <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whale was reported ensnared in fishing nets early Thursday off Point Conception, 120 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Sautter </PERSON>. `` We are trying to get someone up there and free it,'' he said. Whales began migrating from the warmer waters in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> earlier this month and will continue their northward treks through May. `` Our real problem time is really next month and into May because the cow-calf pairs are the last to leave,'' said <PERSON> Sautter </PERSON>. `` The young frequently get separated and get into trouble.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has tentatively concluded that a spy ring of West German computer hackers did not gain access to the types of secrets that would jeopardize <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s national security, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said he was not at liberty to discuss the specific computer networks the German hackers penetrated, what they learned in the process and what they passed on to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. But, in breaking two weeks of official silence, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> no longer viewed the case as a serious threat to military security. `` Based on the information that we have thus far, and this is not complete ... our best judgment is that the computer hackers did not penetrate secure programs,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The initial review of evidence assembled by American and West German authorities suggests the spy ring never gained access to the computer systems that contain classified secrets, he continued. `` All this is subject to change should new information turn up in the course of the investigation. But, to the best of our knowledge, it does not appear at this point that there was any compromise of classified information,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The West German government broke up the computer espionage operation March 3, arresting three individuals and later disclosing that eight others were still under investigation. On March 6, a spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, told reporters the continuing investigation suggested `` the information obtained by the hackers does not appear to be that sensitive.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, however, had declined until Thursday to say whether it agreed with that assessment. The West German ring was cracked in large measure through the work of a lone <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer expert, an astronomer named <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> has said he observed the ring trying to break into about 450 computer banks, and that the hackers did gain access to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s general data bank, named <ORGANIZATION> Optimus </ORGANIZATION>, as well as computers at several defense contractors and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network has reported the hackers also tapped <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and `` Star Wars'' research computers. Citing unidentified sources, the network reported that three hackers handed over information from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during a 1985 meeting with two <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The TV network also reported that authorities believe the West German hackers were recruited by the Soviet intelligence agency in 1985 and `` were paid with cash and drugs.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, while breaking the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's silence on the matter, declined to confirm precisely which computer databanks the hackers penetrated. `` No classified programs. That's really about all I can say on the subject,'' he replied. `` I do n't have any information that would imply there was any involvement by Americans,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> added.

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier who vanished for 11 days has been charged with giving East German officials <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans for defending the border against a Soviet bloc assault, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military statement said the East Germans notified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities that Spec. 4 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had made contact with them. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> disappeared from his unit near the East German border Feb. 21, taking a portable computer with him. The 21-year-old soldier from <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, turned himself in 11 days later after a search that left American military officials baffled. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources said privately the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government was quietly asked for help in locating <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> soon after his disappearance because, one said, `` we had no idea if he was a defector, had been hurt or whatever.'' Several days after the request, `` we finally heard back from them saying they had identified such a person and had interviewed him, but that he had left,'' the source said. `` We now believe he left <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, went to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and then back into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to his unit. We know he once lived in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> before he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, but we really do n't know exactly what's going on here. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> also brought back the computer he took from his unit, where he worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist, officials have said. `` The specific information that we have based the charges on pertains to his unit's general defense plan,'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in response to a question. `` I am not really in a position to give any more information. It's inappropriate to comment any more pending the outcome of the investigation.'' <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> was assigned to the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, which isresponsible for a front-line defense at the border. The unit, based in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION> about 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, is equipped with tanks and armored personnel carriers. In a statement sent to news media, the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> `` has been charged with espionage _ communicating documents and-or information relating to national defense to the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> -LRB- GDR -RRB-.'' `` He was further charged with unlawfully having classified information in his possession; removing classified documents from a classified document storage area; moving classified documents to the GDR and transfer of classified information to unauthorized persons,'' the statement said. It provided no further details about the information <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> allegedly provided the East Germans and did not mention any money changing hands or a possible motive. It said no date had been set for his trial. Maj. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, deputy spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> the matter was `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national defense information as far as it pertains to our <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> mission and to the general defense plan as a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> force.'' According to the written statement, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> was charged with `` failure to obey the lawful regulations that require him to get permission to travel to the German Democratic Republic.'' Regulations also required him to check with his unit's special security officer `` before going into a Communist-controlled country.'' The statement did not say where <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> went in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or how he crossed the heavily guarded border. He was being held at <LOCATION> Mannheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and already has been charged with such other offenses as being absent without leave. Some news reports speculated that he defected because a military vehicle he signed out was found Feb. 23 near <LOCATION> Obersuhl </LOCATION>, a remote town northeast of <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION> and near the border. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had been stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since March 1988. He was responsible for operating equipment that detects enemy radar and other signals. Before his arrest, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials said, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> was `` a good clean-cut soldier'' with a `` perfect record.'' `` In fact, he had been promoted and nominated for ` Soldier of the Month' twice in the year he has been here,'' <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said earlier this month. `` That's what makes it so baffling.'' Those who thought <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had defected recalled that Pvt. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, defected in March 1987 with his West German girlfriend to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in November 1987. He was tried as a deserter and given a bad-conduct discharge after conviction on the lesser charge of being absent without leave.

 The town of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> agreed Thursday to allow a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> group to pass out its tracts on the beaches during spring break after a federal judge defended the rights of the evangelists. Ministers had sued the resort town after an official sent them a letter advising that distribution of the literature would violate an anti-soliciting ordinance. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON>, however, advised the town at a hearing that `` the public beaches are a public forum'' and that handing out religious literature was protected by the Constitution.

<HEAD>Senate Democrats Privately Debate Legislative Agenda</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats debated in private on Thursday over a broad agenda for the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that pledges not to `` oppose the -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- administration automatically, but to propose new policies and pursue them cooperatively.'' A 10-page draft `` agenda for action'' that served as the basis for the closed-door discussion shied away from specifics on many of the major issues confronting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It omitted any mention of the possible use of higher taxes to reduce the deficit, and skipped over details of any effort to resolve the savings and loan crisis. At the same time, it called for enactment of a lengthy list of legislation that seemed certain to spark combat with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, ranging from a hike in the minimum wage to a program of national volunteer service, strengthened environmental enforcement and widespread, affordable health care. It also called for an expanded commitment to education, research and development, agriculture and trade. `` It is not a political platform,'' said the draft that produced debate two days in a row at closed party caucuses just off the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. `` Neither can it include every item of interest to every senator, or accommodate every difference of emphasis and viewpoint.'' Democrats initially hoped to make a public release of the material on Friday, but officials indicated the date was likely to slip past the two-week Easter recess that begins at the end of the week. They said some changes had been made in the draft, a copy of which was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, but declined to discuss them. Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, who was in charge of the effort to produce the agenda, said the discussion had been a `` healthy debate,'' that centered in part on the concerns by some senators that the draft was short on specifics. Other senators said Democrats might try to come up with a second, more concrete set of promposals later in the year. The proposed agenda grew out of a commitment by Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, the newly elected majority leader, to consult widely with other Democrats and produce a set of legislative guidelines for Democrats to adhere to during the two-year <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that convened in January. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> to coordinate the effort, and the result of <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>'s conversations with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators was reflected in the draft agenda that he and the majority leader presented to the 55-member <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus on Wednesday and Thursday. `` With this report we offer the president our hand,'' said the draft. `` We do not expect the administration to accept every item. We seek only cooperation and progress.'' It says that the job for Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is `` not to oppose the administration automatically, but to propose new policies and pursue them cooperatively.'' The draft agenda committed Democrats to ensuring a prosperous economy, protecting the national security, preserving the environment and defending `` essential family values,'' and outlined specific legislation to accomplish each of those goals. But on many of the most contentious issues, Democrats shied away from specifics in their draft. `` It is imperative that we significantly reduce budget and trade deficits,'' they said. But the only two specific steps mentioned for deficit reduction are a demand for `` realistic economic projections'' and insisting on `` accurate calculations of budget numbers.'' When it comes to the faltering savings and loan industry, the draft agenda called for taking legal action against those who committed fraud and abuse and urged unspecified `` tough new regulatory reform.''

 Except for one thing, <PERSON> Deeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> is a lot like hundreds of other adventurous bicyclists planning to ride across the country this summer. The difference is that <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> is legally blind. The ride is her attempt to prove to others _ and maybe to herself _ that people with disabilities should pursue their dreams despite risks. For her, that means `` putting my life on the line'' in order to feel more alive. `` I've been called really stupid for doing this. People ask why I feel I have to do it,'' says the soft-spoken 38-year-old. `` But I think that's what life is. I ca n't just be sitting around.'' She leaves April 1, and hopes to arrive in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> by late July. `` I see this as a project about the preconceived ideas and beliefs about people who are different,'' she said in a telephone interview from her home in <LOCATION> Novato </LOCATION>, about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> will be accompanied by a sighted companion, and they'll communicate through two-way helmet radios A support car will follow. The planned route rolls down the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, then across <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Along the way, she plans to meet with civic leaders, speak to Rotary groups, compare notes with other disabled people and, she hopes, create a lasting impression of what the disabled can do. Before she lost her sight a decade ago, <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON>, a diabetic, was an athletic graduate student and amateur photographer. First the disease took away the feeling in her feet. Then, just as she was completing requirements for a masters degree in psychotherapy, she started losing her sight. She now has only 6 percent vision in one eye _ just enough to distinguish fuzzy shadows from light. `` I always had a dream of riding a bicycle across the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and a dream of taking pictures of people across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But with school and my career, there was never time,'' she said. Her blindness prompted her to `` question the way I'd been looking at the world.'' She first resumed her interest in portrait photography. Using the little sight she has, she frames her subject in the viewfinder. But the photos are intentionally out of focus. The idea is to show her perception of the world. `` If I have a perfectly focused picture, it's an accident,'' she said, boasting that `` many, many famous portrait photographers say I capture things that others ca n't.'' Cycling is a greater challenge. She ca n't feel the pedals with her feet. She ca n't see curbs or potholes. She first prepared herself for months by lifting weights and practicing on a stationary bike. When she was ready to try riding a bicycle last December, friends helped her get one in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. But she waited until after they were gone to get on it. Then she took the mountain bike with 1.9-inch balloon tires, onto the wide, smooth driveway outside her condominium. `` I spent about 20 minutes just straddling it before I had the nerve to actually put my feet on the pedals and start moving,'' she said recalling how frightened she was. Finally, she decided to ride in a big circle. Off she went, repeating the round path until she realized she was near a curb. She turned to miss it, but almost hit a garage. `` And then my fear was real.'' Since then, she says `` it's just been a continuous building up of confidence.'' She listens carefully for the sound of oncoming traffic. She makes the most of what sight she has. She learned Wednesday that the woman who will start the trip with her will be able to go only as far as <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. But she is confident she'll be able to find someone to ride with her from there, or will somehow find the nerve to go it alone. `` If we have to end it in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, there'll be some disappointment in that,'' she said Thursday. `` But to say I went across the country on a bicycle really is not what my goal has ever been.'' <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> extended her training routes gradually to the point where she now rides between 20 and 45 miles a day by herself on the quiet roads around her home. `` One day I was heading down a hill, and I was picking up speed and I was very afraid. Suddenly, I raised my head and felt the wind in my face. And I felt like I was kissing the wind.''

 Two detainees who have been on a hunger strike to demand they be freed or put on trial are seriously ill but are refusing medical treatment and food, lawyers said Thursday. The two black activists are among several dozen detainees refusing to eat in protest of the 33-month-old state of emergency measures that allow police to hold people for an undetermined time without trial. <PERSON> Sandile </PERSON> <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON>, 26, marked his 27th day without food Thursday and was growing weak at a hospital in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, according to his lawyer, <PERSON> Dhaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Pillay </PERSON>. <PERSON> Donsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Khumalo </PERSON>, a labor union official, was in `` extremely serious'' condition at a <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> prison, according to his lawyer, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. The attorney said <PERSON> Khumalo </PERSON> has been on hunger strike for only seven days, but he was refusing water as well as food. In <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, about 3,500 students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> held a rally in support of the detainees. `` A university can not perform its proper role in society under the institutionalized abuse of human rights,'' the vice chancellor of the university, P.D. <PERSON> Booysen </PERSON>, told the crowd. Detainees in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> began the hunger strike Jan. 23 and as many as 500 have participated for varying lengths of time since then. Most strikers resumed eating when Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> promised Feb. 16 to release a substantial number of detainees. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said Wednesday he has authorized 400 releases, leaving about 400 people in detention. Anti-apartheid groups have questioned the figures and accused <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> of reneging on his pledge. Many of those released have been placed under tight restrictions that limit their movements and activities. An estimated 30,000 people, almost all black, have been detained for varying lengths of time since the government imposed the emergency regulations, which give security forces wide powers and ban most forms of peaceful protest. In another development, a political activist who has been in hiding for three years turned himself in to authorities Thursday. Police had sought <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Issel </PERSON> for alleged violations of the country's Internal Security Act, which covers a wide range of activities considered subversive. <PERSON> Issel </PERSON> was released on bail pending a court hearing April 18.

<HEAD>Official Says Third World Debt Plan Could Cut Total Owed by 20 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chief architect of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's debt-reduction initiative estimated Wednesday that the plan could cut the total debt owed by 39 Third World countries by about 20 percent over the next three years. The estimate by Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> during congressional testimony was the first public acknowledgement by the administration of the scope of its new initiative, which was unveiled last week by Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. The administration's effort, which represents a major switch in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, got the endorsement Thursday of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who issued a statement expressing full support for the principles behind <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s proposal. However, many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> remained unsatisfied with both the amount of detail the administration was willing to provide and also with major elements of the administration's debt-forgiveness proposal. While praising President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for at least doing more than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, Democrats in both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> charged that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initiative lacked the boldness needed to solve the pressing problems of poverty that have engulfed <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in a new wave of political and economic instability. `` We need more,'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., told <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> `` More details, more careful thinking and bolder international initiatives.'' But <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, who testified before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee and later to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, asked members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give the plan a chance to work. He said that the plan's initial success could be determined by the first week in April, when the 151-nation <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to discuss Third World debt matters. After the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration refused for years to endorse any broad-based efforts at debt forgiveness, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has now put forward a plan that encourages banks to voluntarily forgive part of the debt owed to them by Third World countries. The Brady Plan, as it was being called during the hearings, moves away from the so-called 1985 Baker Plan, named for <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s predecessor at <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and now Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said that the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> proposal projected a possible 20 percent reduction in the debt owed by 39 Third World countries and an additional 20 percent reduction in the amount of debt interest payments these countries would be required to make over the next three years. The 39 developing countries, which include the largest debtor nations and many of the smaller ones, collectively owe $ 340 billion. A 20 percent reduction in that debt over three years would total $ 70 billion with another $ 20 billion in relief coming from a 20 percent reduction in the estimated $ 102 billion in interest payments these countries would be required to make over the next three years. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> stressed that these projections were only rough estimates and would vary widely from country to country. A country like <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, generally considered a `` good'' debtor nation because it has strived to implement necessary economic reforms, could `` considerably exceed,'' the 20 percent estimate, <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said. On the other hand, he said that some countries might realize no debt reduction at all if they fail to implement needed economic reforms. `` It is very important not to get pinned down on a specific set of numbers because numbers invariably raise expectations or depress expectations, depending on one's point of view,'' <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said. He was responding to questions concerning a report in Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, which said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates had been provided privately in meetings with representatives of commercial banks Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> expressed qualms that the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan did not go far enough in providing debt relief, especially in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where living standards have been falling since the debt crisis first erupted seven years ago. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said the flood of refugees and illegal drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was directly related to the growing poverty in the region He said the only surprise in the debt-triggered riots which left 300 dead two weeks ago was that they occurred in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, `` one of the most prosperous countries in the region.'' The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan was endorsed Thursday by <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, whose statement was issued after several reports of a behind-the-scenes battle between the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the administration over the proposal. In his statement, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said, `` I fully support the principles put forward by Secretary <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> last Friday for helping the heavily indebted countries to resolve their economic and financial problems. ... The challenge ahead for all of us is to reinvigorate the process and ensure that it works.'' As part of his testimony, <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> also released several reports saying the administration opposed establishing an international agency to facilitate the writing off of debt. He said that the resources of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> were sufficient to handle the problem and a new agency was not needed. Under the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan, both organizations would support direct debt relief and would provide guarantees covering the reduced debt remaining after the write-offs.

 Here are remarks by <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, sister of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, at a ceremony Thursday marking the fourth year of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s captivity as a hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>: `` Three-and-a-half years ago, at the beginning of our struggle to make the world aware that there were hostages being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Father <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> lay chained and blindfolded, scant feet from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> became ill and delirious from pneumonia complications, eventually losing his battle to live, as his fellow hostages prayed for him. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> died on June 3, 1985, and the world stood silent. `` On April 17, 1986, American <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilborn </PERSON> and two British hostages were executed in retaliation for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Americans applauded this hostile act, and the families of the hostages buried their dead. In 1987, French hostage <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON> became so ill that he was reduced to crawling on his hands and knees to use the toilet. He died before the horrified eyes of his fellow hostages, and once again the world stood silent. `` Today, we know that of the nine American hostages being held, one has gone mad and another has twice attempted suicide. Two hostages tried to escape and were beaten senseless by their captors. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has pounded his head against the dirty, stone wall of his cell until the blood ran. Frustrated, angry, lonely and tired of being caged like an animal, he finally broke. `` How long will <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> stand silent in the face of this abomination? How long will their fellow Americans debate and discuss what, if anything, should be done to free these innocent men while they waste away and some go mad and some die and we still continue to debate and discuss. `` This is not or should not be a political issue.

No more debate. No more discussion. Our message to their captors, to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and to the world must be that simple: Enough is enough. In the words of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, this can not continue. I say again: This can not continue. Enough, for God's sake, enough.''

<HEAD>Government Says Apples Not ``Imminent Hazard'' to Kids</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal health officials sought Thursday to calm growing public fear over the consumption of apples by children, telling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that pesticide levels on apples pose no `` imminent hazard'' to pre-schoolers. Some senators said the uproar over the use of the chemical Alar on apples and its health effects on small children has produced an apple scare that threatens the industry from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. `` The apple market is dead as a doornail right now across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, whose family is in the apple business. Other senators said they now hesitate to give apple products to their own children. Many apple growers and processors say their apples are free of Alar, which has been linked to cancer in animal tests. But large numbers of parents are reported to have stopped giving apples to their children since a private environmental group said youngsters were especially at risk from the chemical because they eat more apples and apple products than adults. School districts in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and elsewhere have stopped providing apples in school cafeterias since the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> gained widespread publicity last month. At a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee hearing on the apple controversy, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` to exercise some crisis control'' because apple growers, even those who do not use Alar, are being hurt and parents are confused by conflicting information Three federal agencies _ the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ issued a joint statement urging parents and school officials to continue providing children apples and apple products, saying there is no `` imminent hazard posed to children in the consumption of apples at this time, despite claims to the contrary.'' `` The federal government believes that it is safe for Americans to eat apples,'' said the statement. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> reminded senators that earlier this week he moved swiftly to direct Chilean fruit off grocery shelves after traces of cyanide were found in two imported grapes. He declared he would do the same if he thought apples were a danger to children. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the president of a food industry group said monetary losses from the two fruit scares `` will probably be felt all through the system.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Aders </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Is it going to lay on the producers or the consumers? My guess is it's going to be shared.'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said that of 800 apple samples tested by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for Alar since 1981 the highest residue levels found were 8 parts per million, which is less than half the 20 parts per million allowed by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is not a significant risk at this time facing the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people in the consumption of apples,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, adding at another point that `` dramatic action'' by consumers such as withholding apples from their children `` is not warranted. ... There does not appear to be a need for panic.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, acting deputy <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator, said any suggestion that there is a `` massive public health problem'' from pesticides on fruits and that children are gravely at risk `` is simply untrue.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> in his testimony criticized the private study's risk estimates as not being scientifically sound and said the report has caused `` misinformation and fear'' among parents and school officials. Nevertheless, he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on children, families, drug abuse and alcoholism that he favors getting Alar off the market and that if the chemical were newly introduced it would not be approved. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> announced earlier in the year it was seeking to have Alar removed from production, but the process could take three years. Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, R-Wash., suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the manufacturer of Alar, `` would do us all a public service if they suspended production of the product'' because the controversy is harming the apple industry Uniroyal has disputed preliminary <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> findings that daminozide, as Alar is technically called, causes cancer. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said most growers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state do not use daminozide, but there was no agreement among witnesses as to how widespread the use of the chemical actually is. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that about 10 percent of the apples are sprayed with Alar, but the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has cited a figure of about 5 percent. Actress <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>, who has been in the forefront of the campaign against <ORGANIZATION> Alar </ORGANIZATION> and is a leader of Mothers and Others for Pesticide Limits, questioned whether anyone knows the extent of the danger from Alar and other pesticides on food products. `` I think what we do n't know about this issue is what's so alarming,'' Ms. <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>, the mother of three small children, said.

 University researchers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> reported results of two separate experiments Thursday which could someday lead to new drugs to use against cancer. _ <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> researchers reported what they said was the first stimulation of the immune system in mucous-lined tissues against a cancer-causing chemical This could lead to inoculations that could keep some cancer-causing chemicals and toxins from being absorbed by the body. _ A team from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> reported tests of a complex compound that, when given with certain steroid drugs, is up to 1,000 times more powerful than current drugs in inhibiting the growth of small capillary blood vessels that tumors need for growth Without the steroids, the compound is a powerful stimulator of capillary growth, which is necessary for ovulation, menstruation and growth of the placenta in women and wound repair in both sexes. Whether suppressing capillary growth is a fruitful anti-cancer strategy has to await safe and effective suppressors, the <LOCATION> Harvard-Pennsylvania </LOCATION> group said. Both reports were published in the issue of Science magazine which is published Friday. Many body tissues exposed to the outside environment are lined with mucous, particularly the nose and mouth. If those tissues are invaded by a virus, a bacterially produced toxin or similar agent, which might produce a cold or other illness, they secrete antibodies. If the virus reappears, the antibodies bind to it and prevent its absorption, as is believed to happen with the viruses that cause colds. Vaccines such as the <PERSON> Sabin </PERSON> oral polio vaccine work, in part, by priming this secretory immune system, one of several in the body, to generate antibodies. But ordinary chemical molecules are generally too small to elicit such a response. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silbart </PERSON>, a toxicologist who is a research fellow in pathology, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keren </PERSON>, professor of pathology, bound a powerful cause of cancer in laboratory animals, 2-acetylaminofluorene or AAF, to the toxin produced by the cholera-causing bacterium Vibrio cholerae. They measured absorption into the bloodstream of a radioactive derivative of the AAF-toxin complex across the membrane of the intestines of rabbits immunized with the complex and compared that with the absorption of the same substance in a control group of rabbits immunized with an unrelated toxin. Absorption of <ORGANIZATION> AAF </ORGANIZATION> into the blood was more than twice in the control group as it was in the test group. The article said the results suggest `` that oral vaccines against carcinogens and toxicants could be developed for humans.'' As to the absorption after immunization, `` Ideally, we'd like to eliminate it completely,'' said <PERSON> Keren </PERSON> in an interview. `` In nature you're going to be exposed to chronic low doses and you might see'' reductions of a factor of 100 or so. `` This is the first hard evidence that you can make the secretory -LRB- immune -RRB- response ... and that it can interfere'' with absorption of the carcinogen, but `` many years of work'' are needed to produce a useful vaccine, he said. The Harvard-Pennsylvania team, led by <PERSON> Judah </PERSON> <PERSON> Folkman </PERSON>, professor of surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, noted that heparin, a complex chemical used as an anti-coagulant drug, has been found to promote capillary growth by itself and to inhibit that growth when combined with certain steroids. Not all investigators have been able to find the anti-capillary effect, and the <LOCATION> Harvard-Pennsylvania </LOCATION> team wrote that `` potent inhibition of angiogenesis -LRB- capillary formation and growth -RRB- ... is also subject to the variable activity of different heparin preparations.'' Those preparations have been `` nonuniform and heterogeneous in composition, molecular size, structure, position of subtituents and sequence. This heterogeneity probably accounts'' for the variability in findings of the effects of heparin. The team used beta-cyclodextrin tetradecasulfate, a doughnut-shaped compound made up of seven repeating units of a substance called glucopyranose with two sulfate groups attached to each unit. The `` hole in the doughnut'' is necessary to carry the steroid drug to the surface of the target cells, the investigators theorized. Tested in chick embryos and rabbit corneas, the activity of beta-cyclodestrin tetradecasulfate showed vessel-suppressing activity `` 100 to 1,000 times that of commercially available heparin,'' fully reproducible from one preparation to another. In the corneas, the substance used with cortexolone `` decreased vessel growth to 18 percent of that of untreated control eyes,'' measured according to vessel length, and to 8 percent according to the density of blood vessels. By itself, beta-cyclodestrin tetradecasulfate stimulated vessel length to 164 percent of untreated controls.

<HEAD>Triple Disaster Leaves 80,000 Homeless</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government said Thursday that a triple disaster of floods, an earthquake and a cyclone has left at least 80,000 people homeless in this landlocked southern African country, and perhaps as many as 110,000. Freak winds wrecked the homes of about 24,000 people, ripping roofs off buildings, uprooting trees and flattening crops in the northern district of <LOCATION> Karonga </LOCATION> on the shores of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, a government spokesman said. Reports of the cyclone reached <LOCATION> Blantyre </LOCATION> as the government mounted a rescue operation to resettle 56,000 people in central and southern districts hit by floods and an earthquake that razed houses already weakened by floodwaters. Falling masonry crushed two people to death in the earthquake on Friday, and six others were reported drowned in the flooding. The spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said the cyclone struck several days ago, but no reports of casualties had been received from local administrators in <LOCATION> Karonga </LOCATION>. He said the state <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preparedness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was waiting for more information from remote areas before making an international appeal for emergency aid. He said efforts were being made to verify reports that an additional 30,000 people lost their homes, livestock and crops in flooding in remote areas over the last 10 days. On Tuesday, the goverment said it began a rescue operation using canoes and motor launches to evacuate tens of thousands of people left homeless by flooding in the central and southern districts of <LOCATION> Nchala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chikwawa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nsanje </LOCATION>. Torrential rain cut roads and a rail line, swept away mud-built villages and created an 50-mile lake at <LOCATION> Nsanje </LOCATION>, near the southeastern border with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. About 600,000 refugees have fled into southern <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> to escape the conflict between government forces and rebels in <LOCATION> Mozambque </LOCATION>. Many refugees are believed to have been affected by the prolonged seasonal rains. The earthquake damaged the homes of 800 people at <LOCATION> Salima </LOCATION>, about 225 miles north of <LOCATION> Blantyre </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>.

 Scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> have completed a study of world rainfall over the last century, creating a new standard by which to measure the greenhouse effect. `` What this gives us is a baseline,'' said <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> climatological research director, of the five-year study scheduled for release Friday. `` If you've got some major deviation, bigger than anything else that has been observed, you'd have to start looking for some new kind of variable ... such as the greenhouse effect.'' The study shows that precipitation has decreased over parts of the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> and increased in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> over the past century. Rainfall in Northern Hemisphere areas south of 30 degrees latitude _ regions such as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and drought-ridden <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ decreased by about 20 percent, the study found. Rainfall in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> rose about 5 percent. The findings are consistent with theories of the greenhouse effect, a suspected global warming due to a steady buildup, of about 4 percent a year, of carbon dioxide, methane and other `` greenhouse gases'' since the era of heavy industry began. The study predicts temperature increases of up to 5 degrees and fluctuations in rainfall near the equator over the next 50 years. But atmospheric scientists emphasized that rainfall trends observed in the study do n't prove the greenhouse effect is at work. Global environmental changes `` can only be measured over a period of years,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, who studied records from more than 2,000 weather stations. `` We can not tell whether the climate is changing by looking at the weather each year. To detect change in climate, you need many decades.'' <PERSON> Blackmon </PERSON> said it was possible that fluctuations over the last century were `` due to a recurring kind of anomaly not related to the greenhouse effect.'' But he added, `` If it -LRB- the warming -RRB- lasts another ten years, it would be unprecedented.'' In 10 years, `` unfortunately it will be too late to do much about the problem,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> atmospheric scientist who developed a model for predicting effects of global warming.

 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday a critical audit commissioned by Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> did n't accurately represent the agency's operations. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said the finding that the agency's financial management system was only `` marginally adequate'' was `` not supported by the specific findings in the report.'' `` That language is taken from their coversheet, their generalization of their findings,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said. He said the study actually found that `` files and paperwork were not located in a form or fashion the auditors thought was desirable.'' `` That did n't suggest there was anything unaccounted for,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said. Neither <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> nor the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would release the audit, which was disclosed in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> offered a point by point rebuttal of the findings reported in the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, saying: `` to the extent that the auditors found nothing to suggest failure in meeting our operational requirements, nothing suggesting fraud or misuse of funds is a very positive result.'' `` An audit is an exercise to find fault. They found fault but what they found we think was of minimal signficance to our principal mission,'' he said. `` We consider the entire audit a declaration that the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is in extremely good shape except for the fact that some of the auditors who did the audit would like to see us with a larger bureaucracy.'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> cited a finding that the agency's procurement staff still had not begun efforts recoup overcharges by private security firms that were uncovered in a 1987 audit. The staff responsible for collecting the money overcharged by security firms in eight judicial disticts had postponed that effort while renegotiating contracts with private contractors hired to guard courthouses and prisons. `` It's not as matter of the money disappearing,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said. `` The bills are in hand. We simply have to devote the contracts personnel to go back and pursue the collections which we will be doing.'' A finding that several of the agency's small airplanes used for hauling prisoners were not designed for that purpose `` was a particularly good example of the auditors reflecting bad information,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said. Seven of the 13 small planes are being refurbished so they can be used to transport prisoners, <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> the surplus aircraft last year, he said. The audit also found the Marshals' Service has not conducted adequate background checks of people hired to protect courthouses or guard prisoners. <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said private security firms are responsible for checking the backgrounds of guards it furnishes under contracts. Off-duty policemen hired to guard prisoners in hospitals are usually provided by local police departments, he said. `` It is n't a matter of people walking in off the street in police uniforms,'' he said. The gaurds are hired as result of `` formal contacts with official representatives'' of local police departments. The audit also found the agency once leased an airplane for $ 10,000 to transport director <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> and two other people from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after a Marshals' Service plane broke down. <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said the plane was leased because <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and seven other senior officials could not have traveled by commercial airlines in time to attend the ceremony.

<HEAD>Forest Service Say Sales From National Forests Netted $388 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government lost money on timber sales in more than two-thirds of the nation's 120 national forests during fiscal 1988, but still recorded an overall profit of $ 388.7 million, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. In its second annual accounting of the costs and benefits of national forest timber sales, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said its timber sales program made a profit of $ 442.2 million in 46 national forests, mostly in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the parts of Southeast. The logging program in the other 74 national forests lost a total of $ 53.7 million. Officials said more than 80 percent of the 12.6 billion board feet of timber harvested from national forests was taken from forests where revenues exceeded expenses. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, chief economist and vice president for resource planning and economics for the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said the report reinforces the society's view that the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s timber sales program is an `` environmentally destructive federal boondoggle.'' The Wilderness Society has been urging the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for several years to halt timber sales in national forests where expenses exceed revenue. The society contends that logging activities in such forests usually are the most damaging to the environment, since the trees tend to be located in the most unapproachable areas. In the rugged Southern Appalachian national forests, for example, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it lost $ 8.34 million on timber sales in fiscal 1988, an increase of $ 1.56 million from the previous year.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Alaska Oil Exploration Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee on Thursday approved legislation that would allow oil exploration in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> but no drilling leases until after a government-financed study considering alternative energy sources. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> defeated an amendment offered by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., that would have delayed any possibility of oil exploration until a comprehensive energy conservation plan was submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> The energy plan language the committee accepted was presented by Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., and is identical to a compromise included in the same legislation last session While the previous bill also passed the energy committee, it failed to get to either the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for a vote. The House has not taken up the measure yet this session. Opponents say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs to have a plan for saving energy and finding alternatives to fossil fuel before it starts drilling for more oil, especially in a part of the country that is the breeding ground for one of the largest herds of migrating caribou in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and home to many other forms of wildlife. Supporters say oil exploration is necessary for national security. `` The closest we've come to nuclear war is in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to protect our oil supply,'' said <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>. But he also spoke of a need for conservation, saying: `` No matter what the actual oil find in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, our national energy needs will require the development of alternative sources of energy. ... The spotlight trained on energy conservation efforts during the late'70s and early'80s has suffered a blackout.'' His amendment requires the departments of interior and energy, the Council on Environmental Quality and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> to prepare a national energy plan within 15 months after the bill is enacted. The plan must consider all potential energy sources and projected energy demands. Bids for oil leases could be taken while the study was under way, but no leases could be granted until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had had six months to study the report. The amendment also requires that the energy secretary establish a grant program to promote research, development and marketing of conservation techniques and alternative fuels. This program would get its money from the sale of oil found in the refuge. Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., called the <LOCATION> Bumpers-Wirth </LOCATION> proposal `` a killer amendment'' because it not only said oil exploration must be delayed until the energy plan was established, but that pursuing oil exploration would take another act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> applauded the passage of the bill, saying the refuge may provide as much as 1 million barrels of oil to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> every day for as long as 30 years. The institute said more than 6 billion barrels have been produced at <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> since 1977 when drilling began there. Another 3 billion barrels are still believed to be available from <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION>. Oil companies want to start drilling at the refuge, which is just east of <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION>, so that oil will continue to flow from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> when the fields in <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> are dry.

 An official of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday welcomed what he said were encouraging signs of a new willingness by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to meet Palestinian demands for a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement. <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaath </PERSON>, an adviser to <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, cited remarks made this week by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and other developments. `` The last three days show a lot of progress _ small progress, but important, significant progress. Many people are so skeptical they are not even willing to see that progress. `` The future is going to come up with all kinds of surprises for all of us _ happy surprises,'' <PERSON> Shaath </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on Tuesday told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that if talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and non-PLO Palestinians do not prosper, `` I suppose we would then have to see negotiations between Israelis and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' The next day, however, he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations that an Israeli-PLO dialogue was difficult to foresee but should not `` categorically'' be ruled out. <PERSON> Shaath </PERSON>, one of three <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials who attended a seminar in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last weekend, has been meeting with private groups in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and was seeing at least two members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He said that he had had no contact with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials during his visit but that he took heart from <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s remarks. `` So far there has been very little substance,'' said <PERSON> Shaath </PERSON>. But he said that talks between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would resume March 22 in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> and that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had been assured <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> would be able to discuss substantive issues. He said these would include the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' demands for the right to self-determination and for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state <PERSON> Shaath </PERSON> said that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had told Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> last month that the U.S.-PLO talks in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> would become substantive. `` We've had assurance in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in the meeting that President <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> held with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> where they discussed really nothing but the Palestinian question,'' <PERSON> Shaath </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> committed himself to Mr. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> then that the dialogue would be resumed and would be made substantive, and we learn now that this is going to be the case on the 22nd.'' `` I think we are very close'' to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognition of the Palestinian right to self-determination, <PERSON> Shaath </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shaath </PERSON> said he was n't discouraged by Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>' criticism of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s initial remarks or <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>' hard-line rejection of talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Shaath </PERSON> said the Israelis would not be able to ignore the Palestinian uprising, or `` intifadeh,'' and would have to come to terms with Palestinian demands. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, citing latest battles in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, urged the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to continue its reconciliation attempts between Moslems and Christians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government is deeply concerned over the heavy exchange of shelling and consequent loss of life'' in eight days of warfare which have left 49 people dead, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. `` We urge all sides to exercise restraint and to avoid civilian casualties at all costs,'' he said. `` We call on General <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doctor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> to cooperate and coordinate directly with one another, to work together to restore and invigorate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s legitimate national institutions,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military Cabinet that has been vying for legitimacy with a rival <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> under acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> since President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term ended Sept. 22. Minutes before stepping down, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to head an interim military Cabinet, but his appointment was rejected by leftists and Moslems who declared allegiance to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the latest fighting threatens to destroy the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s peace initiative in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> actively supports this initiative and encourages the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to continue its effort,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study: Black Women Have Less Financial Incentive than White Women
to Marry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Black women are spending twice as many years living without a spouse than white women, at least in part because they believe they have less financial incentive to get married or stay married, a researcher says. An ongoing study of the economic and other disparities between races determined that black women are catching up financially with black men at a rate much faster than the pay of white women is approaching that of white men. The researcher, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> sociology professor <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, said one obvious reason for that is that wages paid black men lag well behind those paid white men. Still, he said, black women often develop the perception it is not in their best financial interest to get or stay married and because of that, they are waiting longer than white women to marry and are divorcing more frequently. `` Black women, when they look around and think about getting married, see that the pool of black men with high earnings is relatively small,'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Wednesday. `` This gives them less of a financial incentive to get married or to remain married.'' Another reseacher, interviewed Thursday, did not dispute <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s finding but said the underlying factor behind it was most likely years of wage discrimination against black men that has resulted in black women having a longer tradition of having to work than white women Because of that, black women have a greater sense of financial independence, even if their wages are lower than those paid white women, said <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, director of the women's studies program at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> `` I think it's true that black men's low income affects the marriage rate of black women,'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. `` But it's overly cynical to say money is the only thing that gets one married.'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said that in 1987, 30 percent of black women between the ages of 15-44 were living with a husband, compared with 52 percent in 1960 and 70 percent in 1950. Fifty-five percent of white women in that age bracket were living with a husband in 1987, down from 69 percent in 1960 and 70 percent in 1950. Several studies have noted complaints by black women that there is a shortage of black males in the marriage pool, but <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said that when numbers alone are considered, those complaints are unfounded. `` There have been nearly equal numbers of black men and women within each age group since the 1970s, so there is not an absolute shortage of black men,'' he said. `` However, the persistently high unemployment rate and limited earnings of black men may lead some black women to delay marriage and, correspondingly, some black men may hesitate to take on the financial obligations of a family.'' Data from 1975-80 indicate that black women on average will spend 16 years of their 73-year life span with a spouse while white women can expect to spend 33 of their expected 77 years with a mate, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said. Higher homicide and incarceration rates among blacks likely contribute to those numbers, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s data were compiled as part of a larger study he is conducting to determine why civil rights programs designed to bring blacks and other minorities on an equal economic footing with whites have failed to do so. Working with data from the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> and other sources, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> determined that the average annual earnings of black women and white women are close _ $ 13,800 for black women in 1987 and $ 14,700 for white women. But earnings of black women are much closer to those of black men, who made $ 18,500 in 1987, while white women still lag well behind white men, who made $ 28,000 in 1987. `` Relative to the incomes of their potential mates, black women are doing better than white women,'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who has never had trouble speaking his mind, ignored his own vow of silence of the subject of his sexuality and proclaimed: `` I'm a heterosexual.'' And the mayor said Thursday he would n't mind if the topic boosts the sales of his latest book, `` His Eminence and <PERSON> Hizzoner </PERSON>.'' `` If you buy that book, you may ultimately be giving a gift to the City of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, in aggregate, of maybe a million dollars,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` So, if I have piqued your interest, rush out and buy the book.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and his co-author, Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, are donating their book profits to charities. The flap began Wednesday night when an interviewer on <ORGANIZATION> WMCA </ORGANIZATION> radio, discussing the difference between <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s views on homosexuality, remarked, `` You yourself have been the subject of innuendo.'' `` I happen to believe that there's nothing wrong with homosexuality. It's whatever God made you. It happens that I'm a heterosexual,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> previously has said that he is not a homosexual and that he once had a girlfriend. But he noted in the current book that he has `` been the subject of scurrilous rumors and gossip in political campaigns.'' In 1977, when he was running for mayor against <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, posters appeared around the city which read, `` Vote for <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, not the Homo.'' He wrote: `` So I took the public position that I would not respond to such an inquiry ever again. People could think whatever they wanted to. My sexuality, just like my religion, is a private matter. I do n't have to account to anyone for it.'' At the news conference, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he had forgotten `` that I had said I would never discuss this subject again. And I never will _ as of today.'' When asked whether the statement was intended to remove sexual preference as a potential campaign issue in the next mayoral election, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> replied, `` That happens to be wrong.'' He had no further comment.

The Socialist government also proposed a law allowing more representation for smaller parties and raising the parliamentary majority required to form a government, making governing coalitions more likely. The main conservative party said the law is aimed at keeping it out of power. The Cabinet reshuffle will be the second since the $ 200 million fraud, forgery and embezzlement scandal involving a fugitive Greek banker broke five months ago, leading to the resignations of eight Cabinet ministers. It will also be <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s 16th Cabinet reshuffle in eight years. Government sources indicated <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> intends to use the reshuffle to purge the Socialist government of ministers implicated in the scandal and attract waning support for his governing <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s party has come under heavy fire for its handling of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> scandal, in which <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and senior government officials have been accused of taking payoffs. A statement issued by government spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said the new Cabinet would be appointed and sworn in Friday. The draft electoral law is to be submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, and lawmakers are to vote on it within the next few weeks. The main conservative opposition <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> accused the government of trying to hamper its efforts to win a clear majority in the upcoming June elections. `` The government has admitted that it has ceased to contest power and its exclusive concern is how to prevent us from acquiring an overall majority,'' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said in a statement. Interior Minister <PERSON> Akis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsochatzopoulos </PERSON> said the proposed electoral law would allow smaller parties to have more seats in the 300-member single-chamber <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. According to <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON>, the premier asked his ministers to resign in order to go ahead with the reshuffle. `` All the ministers have been asked and verbally submitted their resignations,'' the spokesman said. Banker-publisher <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, 34, was indicted in the scandal and fled <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> on Nov. 6. He was arrested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he is jailed awaiting a decision on extradition requested by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The banker has alleged that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and other senior Socialist officials received millions of dollars in payoffs and authorized plans to loot millions from the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> while he was its chairman. The draft bill proposes a new proportional system for electing deputies and increases the margin needed to elect a government from 45 percent of the vote, the previous level, to about 48 percent, an electoral analyst said. The analyst said on condition of anonymity that the new law would open the way for coalition governments. Under the country's present reinforced proportional system, large political parties are heavily favored in seat distributions. In the 1985 elections, the system gave <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> 45.8 percent of the vote and 161 seats. New Democracy received 40.8 percent and 126, the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> got 9.89 percent and 12 seats, and the Eurocommunists polled 1.84 percent and one seat. Political defections have left <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> with 154, the conservatives with 111 and the Communists with nine. The Eurocommunists retain their one seat and the rest are independents.

<HEAD>Irish Complain Of Immigration Raids Amid St. Patrick's Hoopla</HEAD>

 As <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> rolled out a green carpet for St. Patrick's Day, some Irish natives were grappling with immigration woes and a feeling that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has not been very hospitable of late. `` With all the Irish names and the festivities and the shamrocks and shillelaghs, I find it ironic that <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> people are living in the shadows here like fugitives,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. While Bostonians were preparing green beer and green bagels, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> raided four businesses suspected of employing illegal aliens. Ten Irish natives were arrested on charges of being illegal immigrants. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday's arrests of four men at a construction site in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, and six women in a raid on a suburban <LOCATION> Quincy </LOCATION> restaurant were purely coincidental and not part of a coordinated sweep. `` We do n't enforce the law by holiday or nationality,'' said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> District Director <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>. `` It just happened.'' But several <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> immigrants and Irish-Americans said the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' timing showed bad taste `` It does n't show a whole lot of sensitivity,'' said <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadigan </PERSON>, who emigrated from <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cork </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION> in 1971. `` Nobody wants to be illegal ... It brings out an attitude that these people have done something wrong.'' `` It could be interpreted as a calculated insult to the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> community, but I'm sure it was n't intended that way,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> IIRM </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview from the group's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, one of 16 pushing for relaxing immigration restrictions concerning the Irish. <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> said that about 50 to 60 Irish natives were charged with immigration law violations last year. Estimates, from the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> and other sources, put the population of illegal immigrants in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> at between 15,000 and 25,000 people. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Reps. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., have sponsored visa programs that will permit 60,000 new immigrants by 1991 from 37 countries, including <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, that have been under-represented in the past, <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> Of the 10,000 visas issued since 1986 under <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>'s bill, about 4,700 went to people from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, he said. But the lawyer representing the women arrested at the <LOCATION> Quincy </LOCATION> restaurant said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration policy still favors Asians and Central and South Americans who can claim political persecution, while penalizing the Irish and other Europeans. `` The immigration laws in this country are such that the Irish immigrants do not have an equal chance of achieving legal status,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, who said his clients would aggressively fight deportation. `` It's out-and-out discrimination.'' <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> called it `` hypocritical for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to be celebrating the Irish contribution while excluding people who are continuing that very same tradition.'' Still, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadigan </PERSON> notes, that tradition and the hoopla it inspires can be a bit bewildering to Irish natives. In <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, celebrations are quieter and less commercial, with people wearing fresh shamrock sprigs and attending church rather than parading and displaying plastic leprechauns, <PERSON> Cadigan </PERSON> said. `` When I came over first I was a little offended by it because <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> is very dear to us, because he brought us the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- faith,'' <PERSON> Cadigan </PERSON> said. `` Now I have learned even to drink green beer if it is offered to me.''

 OCTOBER _ West German authorities conducting raids discover a radio-cassette player containing plastic explosives and a barometric timing device that could be set to detonate a bomb at a given altitude. Thirteen alleged members of the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group are arrested.

It now says that warning would have been circulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines and other agencies that would need to know. DEC. 5 _ The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> is warned in a telephone call of a plot to bomb a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> airliner on a Frankfurt-U.S. flight during a two-week period in December. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> issues an `` intelligence alert'' that there might be a bomb attempt against a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. DEC. 9 _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities notify the British government of the Dec. 5 warning to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>.

The bulletin is addressed to all British airports plus British and American airlines, and <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> and South African Airways. DEC. 21 _ Flight 103 is destroyed over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. DEC. 23 _ A British official says the government issued no public warnings about the Dec. 5 threat made against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights because the information was considered confidential. British airports were not told about the information passed on by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities, apparently because the threat did not specifically mention <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Weiss: Questions About Koop Decision</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said Thursday he was concerned that Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> appears to have misstated the extent of evaluation that went into <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s decision not to issue a report on the health effects of abortion. At a hearing of the Government Operations subcommittee on human resources, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> and other members of the panel questioned <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> for more than two hours, mostly about <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s conclusion that there is `` insufficient scientific and statistical evidence on which to base an unimpeachable report.'' The report had been requested by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but in a Jan. 9 letter to the then-president, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said 250 studies dealing with the psychological aspects of abortion have been reported in scientific literature. He said in the letter that `` all of these studies were reviewed and the more significant studies were evaluated by staff in several of the agencies of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ... and were found to be flawed methodologically. `` In their view and mine, the data do not support the premise that abortion does or does not cause or contribute to psychological problems,'' his letter said. However, under questioning, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> acknowledged that only a report by a pro-life group received written evaluations by reviewers and that all other studies referred to health service experts for review were only discussed orally. `` I am disturbed by what seems to be a conclusive statement based on evaluations of studies which turn out not to have been ... reduced to writing, -LRB- that were -RRB- discussed orally, whatever that means,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, chairman of the panel. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, who is a staunch abortion foe, said he reviewed some of the articles himself, but he said could not detail how much time he spent on the task. But, he said, as examples of flawed methodologies, most of the studies looked at only a short period of time after abortion, from three to six months. `` I know very well from my own experience that many of the problems that do occur after abortions ... occur at a considerable time after abortion,'' he said. `` I know that women, many times for a period that seems inordinately long to me, have apparently no reaction adversely to the psychological effects of abortion and then something triggers it in their mind and they become severely depressed or anxious or sometimes incapable of carrying on their work,'' he said. But <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said scientific data is lacking on the topic. Pro-life groups maintain that many women who have abortions suffer many years later from a stress disorder similar to that suffered by Vietnam War veterans. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> also said he was concerned about allegations made by a former <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> scientist who said his work at the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was `` censored.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>, now a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, told the subcommittee he left the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> facility in the summer of 1986 after twice having papers he was having published `` censored'' because of their references to abortion.

 The small birthmark on newborn <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Watling </PERSON>'s left cheek grew so large so fast, her parents sometimes feared waking her in the morning for fear they'd see the deformity had spread across her entire face. But <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Watling </PERSON> said doctors in the <LOCATION> Skelmersdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, area where they live warned that corrective surgery had to wait until <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> turned 7, despite the danger that delay could destroy the sight in her left eye. News about pioneering laser surgery being done in similar cases with children at the <ORGANIZATION> Palo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> gave them hope for their daughter, who turns 2 on March 24. And a series of heartwarming, albeit wacky, fund-raising stunts on <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>'s behalf gave them the money for the series of operations, which climaxed on Thursday when Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Apfelberg </PERSON> used a laser to cut away the bulk of the orange-sized tumor, called a hemangioma. After surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> was wrapped in a head bandage covering her face. `` She's dressed up like an Egyptian mummy,'' <PERSON> Watling </PERSON> said from his daughter's side in the recovery room. `` But the growth is gone. There's no growth there anymore.'' And how did <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> deal with the experience? `` I do n't think she understands too well,'' Watling said. `` All she knows is that any time someone in white comes near her, it hurts.'' Additional reconstructive surgery can be done in another six months or so, <PERSON> Apfelberg </PERSON> said, adding that `` she's always going to have some residual.'' Later surgery will be required to reconstruct the left side of <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>'s face and cover the scar. About one in every 500 to 800 children have some form of birthmark, <PERSON> Apfelberg </PERSON> said, although 90 percent disappear by the age of 6 to 8. The cause is unknown, he said, although it probably occurs during the first three months of pregnancy when a fetus develops its facial features. But the doctor said <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>'s hemangioma, which at one point almost completely covered her left eye, is `` one of the most severe that we've seen.'' British doctors lack the technology and training for the laser procedures pioneered and developed at the <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> clinic in the 1970s, <PERSON> Apfelberg </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Watling </PERSON> said that when she heard about the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> techniques, she and her sister, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gledhill </PERSON>, immediately began looking for ways to collect the $ 425,000 necesssary for the surgery and other treatments. From that point, she said, things `` snowballed.'' British sailors in the middle of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> chipped in, long-haired women staged public head-shaving exhibitions in exchange for donations and inmates in a local prison played 24-hour badminton games. The prison warden had himself locked up for 24 hours, while other officials staged a mock breakout and women prisoners gave <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> money they had saved to buy a VCR. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> donated airfare for the family's trips to <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>. `` If people had n't been so generous, there was no possibility of us coming here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Watling </PERSON> said. In three other treatments, <PERSON> Apfelberg </PERSON> sealed some blood vessels to halt tumor growth and start the shrinking process as <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>'s body began reabsorbing the cells. The operation also caused 90 percent of the mark to change from red to a normal skin color. Additional treatment did more of the same, and <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> was fitted with a pressure face mask in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> that, worn 18 hours a day, also worked to achieve the same end. Thursday's laser surgery had been set for mid-January, but doctors discovered <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> was anemic and sent her home to gain strength.

 Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Thursday of `` a dismal record'' in helping the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> battle illicit drugs, launching a bid to deny the country any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid or trade benefits. `` It appears that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is planning to conduct business as usual. And up to this time, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has been in the business of protecting drug kingpins,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Republican., charged <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is this country's top source for heroin and its No. 2 source of marijuana, according to statistics compiled by the Department of State. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' comments came as he introduced a measure in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to remove <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> from a list of nations granted continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial aid because they have been `` fully cooperating'' with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government in its war on drugs. The measure is co-sponsored by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss Under the law, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is required to formally certify that each nation, while it may be a major drug producer or transit point, is cooperating against the war on illicit narcotics. In a report accompanying the list, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month praisd <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for its efforts in the drug war, even though Secretary of Sate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> admitted that the international war on illegal drugs was `` clearly not being won'' and might even be `` slipping backwards.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> cited Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' `` strong public stance'' against drugs, as well as the efforts of his new deputy attorney general But corruption was seen as a continuing problem. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 63-27 to punish <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for its lack of cooperation in the battle against drugs, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> killed a similar measure. `` I am very concerned that the entire certification process has become a sham,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. `` I do not accept the argument that decertification of a non-cooperating country will hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic or diplomatic interests. That is pure poppycock.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> charged that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has had a `` dismal record of non-cooperation in the drug war in the past year.'' He faulted <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for, among other things, corruption at the highest levels of government, for failing to allow overflights and hot-pursuit actions by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement aircraft, for denying access to air surveillance flights, for denying access to bank records to assist drug investigations and for its failure to prosecute the principal suspects in the murder of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>.

 The jury in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial was told Thursday of a daring plan, said to have been approved by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, that involved an air-drop of recoilless rifles to help the Nicaraguan Contras sink arms-carrying ships. Whether the air drop was ever attempted was not brought out in the fifth and last day of questioning <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> boss, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. After he left the stand, the jury was dismissed until Monday. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said that although he had pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he felt he should not have been charged. `` I felt quite passionately about the fact that I had not willfully lied to people,'' he said. But he added that `` it was quite clear I withheld information'' and `` I had to accept the consequences of what I had done.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, referring to papers introduced while MFarlane was on the stand, said, `` What those documents show is that during the period of the Boland Amendment you and the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> did a lot of things to aid the military activities of the Contras.'' `` Yes,'' said <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. The Boland Amendment, in force between 1984 and 1986 prohibited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help to the guerrillas. The jury learned in the course of <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s testimony that _ despite <LOCATION> Boland </LOCATION> and with <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s encouragement _ money was solicited from other countries, tactical advice was offered the Contras, efforts were made to open a new military front in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, plans were drawn to shoot down Soviet-made helicopters and consideration was given to seizing and sinking a ship carrying ammunition to the Nicaraguan government. Also, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> testified, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved $ 110 million worth of inducements to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in exchange for giving sanctuary to the Contras and allowing military aid to pass through. `` All this was done because the president said ` keep the Contras together, body and soul?''' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked. `` Yes,'' said <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. He also replied `` yes'' when asked if people who were likely to be called before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were kept ignorant of certain information so they would n't have to lie under oath. Approval by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of the air-drop plan was noted by North co-defendant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> on a `` top secret'' Oct. 30, 1985, memo drafted by <PERSON> North </PERSON>, according to a description offered in court by the chief defense lawyer. As <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> examined the memo on the witness stand, attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> had signed the approval line and written `` President approved.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> read portions of the memo and told the jury that under the line `` what to tell the president'' were these words: `` We intend to air drop intelligence along with two ... recoilless rifles which will be used to sink one or both of the arms carriers.'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said recoilless rifles are `` designed to knock out a very hard target such as a tank, a bunker or a plane on the ground.'' `` Or sink a ship as it says here,'' added <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>: `` You understand Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> had the ability to air-drop weapons and intelligence of this sort and this was part of his job at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>?'' `` Yes,'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser at the time, said the memo did not come to him. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> was then <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s deputy and later became his successor. North, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel attached to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, worked for both men. North is on trial on 12 charges including lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. His defense has been designed to convey to the jury that he had authority for all the actions charged against him as crimes. Meanwhile on Thursday, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> was in another courtroom for housekeeping matters in his case. He faces trial on charges similar to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he hoped that trial can get under way in summer or early fall, after <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s ends Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told the judge he does not know yet whether the government will follow its action in the North case and drop two key charges _ conspiracy, and theft of government property _ that are still lodged against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> resigned his job as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s top national security aide on Dec. 4, 1985, although he undertook a trip to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> with North the following May to press <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the release of Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The trip was a failure.

<HEAD>Incomes Down Again in Latin America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Average incomes dropped again in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> last year by about 1 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. `` The gap in per capita income between <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the industrialized countries has grown by about one-third in the 1980s,'' the bank said in its annual report. Some countries did comparatively well. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> put the average income as $ 1,310 in 1987, and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, where the average had dropped to $ 1,040, both reported growth of 6 percent in 1988. That left them still far behind the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where the average citizen earned $ 18,430 in 1987, according to <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> figures. The worst drops _ more than 3 percent _ were in <LOCATION> Guayana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>. Growth was slow in the countries with the biggest economies, and the biggest debts: <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, where three out of every five Latin Americans live, average incomes were down. `` The debt overhang continues to sap the economic strength of the region, undermining its ability to import more and invest more,'' the report said. Latin American countries have debts abroad of more than $ 400 billion dollars. Lower Latin American imports make for less business and fewer jobs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other industrial countries. Lower investment means a lower standard of living for the next generation of Latin Americans. The report was issued the same day that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, announced the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration opposes creation of an international debt management authority as proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and Latin American leaders. He also opposed proposals that the fund use its gold or issue `` special drawing rights'' to help debtor countries, or that the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> tap assets that are not now out on loan. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> leaves Friday to represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, where the report will be discussed at the annual meeting of the 44 governments in the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. He is expected to announce the end of a three-year dispute between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other donor countries on one side, and Latin American borrowers on the other, over power to delay loans by the bank. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, then secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, asked last year for a change in the bank's voting system to allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, when it could get <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s support, to delay a loan for as long as two years, thus virtually killing it. Long negotiations gave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> much less _ a maximum delay of 12 months, with the need of additional votes beyond its own and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s to get even that, according to informed sources who declined to be further identified. The agreement cleared the way to make another $ 22.5 billion available to the bank over the next four years. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has 34.57 percent of the shares, would supply $ 7.8 billion but only about $ 350 million would have to be paid in. Last year the bank approved $ 1.7 billion in new loans to modernize industry, farms and tourist enterprises, improve roads, increase electric power, build health centers, clean up water and treat sewage. The report called attention to the growth of new exports from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: soy beans, fish, fresh fruit. `` Exports of Chilean table grapes alone reached an estimated $ 500 million in 1988,'' said the report -- prepared well before the recent discovery of cyanide in a shipment to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Opposition politicians angrily walked out of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday over a secret report allegedly linking a leading government aide to Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s murder. All but one of the 93 opposition lawmakers in the 245-member <LOCATION> Rajya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, decided to boycott proceedings through Friday. They walked out after Chairman <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> refused to ask the government to release the report on the 1984 slaying. Some of the 63 opposition members who were suspended Wednesday from the Lok Sabha, or lower house, for demanding disclosure of the report met with President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> and urged him to direct the government to turn over the report to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The government has said the report will remain classified, citing national security interests. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed a law in July 1986, five months after the report was completed, empowering the government to suppress sensitive reports. Government sources said on condition of anonymity that the report has been seen only by the slain leader's son and successor, <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, and two senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers who have taken an oath of secrecy. The opposition's demand was first raised Tuesday after the Indian Express, the country's largest English-language newspaper, published excerpts from the report and sought to link a powerful government official to Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s assassination four years ago. The Bombay-based newspaper quoted the inquiry as saying that <PERSON> Rajendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s personal secretary for more than 20 years, had `` consciously or unconsciously ... facilitated the commission of a crime.'' <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON>, 52, left the post after the assassination but was brought back into the government last month as a key aide to the prime minister. <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> has refused comment on the allegations, but other government officials have said he is innocent of any wrongdoing. But in their memorandum to the president, opposition leaders argued the report apparently `` contains findings adverse to Mr. <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON>. ... Otherwise, the question of his exoneration would not have arisen.'' The inquiry, ordered by the government and conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> M.P. <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON>, ran parallel to police investigations into the assassination. It was submitted to the government in 1986. Opposition members in the upper house shouted slogans and pounded on their desks Thursday, demanding the government make the report public. When <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> refused to consider the issue, opposition legislators walked out and said they would not return this week. They then marched to the Presidential Palace and delivered copies of Tuesday's Indian Express to the president and demanded he order the government to release the report The Indian Express, which has a nationwide circulation of 1.1 million, is frequently critical of <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was shot and killed by two Sikh bodyguards on Oct. 31, 1984, as she walked through the garden of her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> residence to a television interview. One of the guards was killed in a shootout with other guards. The other was convicted of murder and hanged Jan. 5, along with a third Sikh who was convicted of conspiracy. In its report, the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said the government report accused <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON> of altering the time of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s appointment with the television crew and that <PERSON> Dhawan </PERSON>, who was walking with Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, fell back `` in the nick of time as they were approaching the scene of the assassination.'' The government has said Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was killed in revenge for an army raid she ordered in June 1984 on the Golden Temple, the Sikhs' holiest shrine

 A lawsuit being filed in response to the beating death of a jail inmate could shed light on allegations that a `` goon squad'' of corrections officers routinely beat prisoners, a lawyer said Thursday. `` There's a lot of unanswered questions in that lockup,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patel </PERSON>, attorney for the family of <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. `` I'm curious as to how they're going to answer why no medical treatment was given to Mr. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> for between 16 and 18 hours. Two corrections officers and a deputy warden at the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> were charged Wednesday with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s murder. They remained Thursday in the <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in lieu of $ 50,000 bail each. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, 28, died Saturday at <LOCATION> University </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. He was brought there two days earlier in a coma, and a coroner's report showed he was beaten about the head, arms and body. County Prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> DePascale </PERSON> has acknowledged that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> did not receive medical treatment for 16 hours after the three guards allegedly beat him for about 20 minutes with a blunt object. <PERSON> DePascale </PERSON> said, however, that the lack of medical treatment did not warrant criminal charges and he would not comment on the delay in taking <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to the hospital. <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> said he filed a notice to sue at the county clerk's office Thursday. State law mandates a six-month waiting period between the notice to sue and the actual filing. <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> said he will seek to subpoena corrections officers who had any connection with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. Testimony could help expose abuses, he said. The death prompted outrage in the community, where some have come forward with stories of a `` goon squad'' that has existed for years. County Executive <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Janiszewski </PERSON> said there is no evidence that the group exists but said his office would investigate. `` I'm getting five or 10 calls an hour from people telling me they know of the goon squads and that they've been beaten,'' <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> said. `` Maybe this suit can help do something about it.'' <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, a Moslem chaplain at the jail for eight years, told the <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> that inmates have repeatedly complained to him about abuse by corrections officers, particularly during the midnight to 8 a.m. shift. The targets of the beatings are usually Hispanics and blacks, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said. The three officers charged worked the midnight shift, <PERSON> DePascale </PERSON> said. Corrections officers <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 39, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumers </PERSON>, 35; and Deputy Warden <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, 52, all of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, were arrested after surrendering to DePascale. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> was in charge of the shift at the time.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said Thursday it has resumed flying arms to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> because of a guerrilla offensive around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, the first major battle since the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> completed its withdrawal Feb. 15. Moslem guerrillas claimed Thursday they had shot down two more aircraft in heavy fighting for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, a strategic eastern city that is the nation's third-largest. The communist government claimed 470 insurgents killed in the previous 24 hours. Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said the airlift resumed Wednesday, a month after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> left the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government to fight the insurgents on its own. He said the weapons included medium-range Scud B missiles, which are said to have been fired from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> at guerrilla positions around <LOCATION> Jalababad </LOCATION>, 75 miles to the east and 40 miles from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. Sources said at least 40 Ilyushin-76 transport planes had landed at thge <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport since Wednesday with military supplies and food. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of sending hundreds of its own soldiers with the guerrillas in the intense, 10-day battle for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. `` We have discussed the situation with the Pakistanis and they know what our reaction will be if their involvement continues,'' he said. `` We are not threatening the Pakistanis, but they must stop.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> supports the guerrillas, along with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but denies any of its soldiers are fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>'s allegation `` fictitious.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Pakistani forces were coordinating the attack on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and forcing teen-age refugees to take up arms. `` Units of Pakistani mercenaries were ordered to carry out forced mobilization starting from age 14 in the Afghan refugee camps near <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` Eyewitness accounts indicate that hundreds of refugee families have decided to return to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on learning about the order,'' it said. `` Protests against the arbitrary actions of the Pakistani military flared up in several camps.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Afghan insurgents and Pakistani soldiers fired on protesters, killing seven people and wounding 12 others. A separate <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dispatch from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> accused Pakistani intelligence officers of coordinating the guerrilla attack. Moslem guerrillas began fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet military forces arrived in December 1979, and an estimated 115,000 were in the country when the U.N.-mediated withdrawal began May 15, 1988. Observers believe a guerrilla victory at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, along the main highway from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, could lead to the fall of the capital. The guerrilla-run <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said insurgents downed a helicopter gunship near <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>'s television station and an airplane outside the city on Wednesday. The latest guerrilla claim brought to seven the number of government aircraft reported destroyed this week in the fight for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. There was no immediate comment from the Afghan government, and it was not possible to confirm the claims. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio claimed Thursday that 470 insurgents were killed in the last 24 hours around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, bringing the total for two days to 1,030. Guerrillas call the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> claims widely exaggerated. It said only six of its troops were killed in the <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> fighting in the last 24 hours. It also said the guerrillas fired `` thousands of rockets and artillery shells'' into <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> during this period, killing four civilians and injuring 18. The guerrilla-run <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 25 Afghan troops were killed and 32 captured in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> on Thursday. Guerrillas have overrun the city's most important garrison, <PERSON> Samarkhel </PERSON> to the east, and were closing in on the airport. But Afghan soldiers retaliated with unexpectedly aggressive aerial and artillery bombardments that reportedly have stalled the guerrillas' progress. Fighting centers north, west and south of the city, according to reports reaching <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Leaders of the U.S.-supported guerrillas have predicted an early collapse of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government in the absence of its Soviet backers, but President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has insisted his forces are strong enough to survive.

<TEXT>
 Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>'s suggestion that economic impact be considered when officials decide whether to grant endangered species status was sharply criticized Thursday by environmental groups. `` His comments are embarassing and naive,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hair </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` He sounds like a kinder and gentler <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> should `` review or reconsider his remarks. I'm disappointed and it does n't send very good signals about President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> being an environmental president. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION>, said the spotted owl dispute unfolding in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> was a `` prime example'' of the difficulty in balancing environmental concerns with economic impacts. `` I'm told, on the one hand, that I want to protect an endangered species,'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said. `` On the other hand, I hear that's going to devastate the entire <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> lumber industry. `` How do we solve that problem? I believe we should be able to take economic considerations into account.'' He suggested that the Endangered Species Act be amended to make economic impact part of the determination process. Under existing law, the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> may consider only `` biological factors'' when deciding whether to protect a species. The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Maybe we should change the law'' to consider economic factors, <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Thursday that <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> believes that while economic impact was `` not a reason to exclude'' a species from protection, `` it is something we should take into account when we are making that decision. `` We need to factor that into the equation,'' said <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>. `` We ca n't operate in a vacuum.'' The spotted owl, which nests only in the ancient forests of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, has become the focal point of an increasingly heated battle over protecting old growth timber. Environmentalists have sought to have the owl protected as an endangered species, but the timber industry has insisted that such a designation could halt logging in vast areas of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and result in the loss of thousands of jobs. The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had previously denied a request from environmentalists that the owl be listed as endangered, but a federal court in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> ordered the agency to review its decision.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked with the Discovery astronauts Thursday from the Oval Office on a television-telephone connection that let him see the spacemen. Here is a transcript: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Hello. Discovery commander <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> L. Coats: Good morning, Mr. President. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: How are you, sir. We just called up to congratulate you and your crew of Discovery. Sitting next to me is our vice president who is now head of the space council and who, incidentally, will be down in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in about two weeks. But what I really wanted to do is to congratulate you and then hear about how things are going. We are certainly proud of the mission. Coats: Thank you very much, sir. We have a very fine orbiter and a very fine crew here and an awful lot of people on the ground worked very hard to get this flight off, the first one of your presidency, and the first one of very many to come. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: It looks to me like you made that crew clean up. I'm watching you I can see you sitting here in the Oval Office. Amazing technology. There are five of you looking pretty clean and pretty fresh. How is everyone feeling on the flight? <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>: We're all feeling very well, Mr. President. It's been an exciting time for us. Of course three of us on the flight are rookies in space. I think the cleanliness and the smiles you see is just a reflection of the fun that goes along with the hard work. We're doing an awful lot of good things, but we're really enjoying what we're doing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: We're following it carefully and glad that the <ORGANIZATION> TDRS </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Tracking and Data Relay Satellite -RRB- had a successful operation there. How's the camera? How's that IMAX camera gon na be? -LRB- IMAX is a 70mm camera used to photograph the Earth. -RRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON>: The IMAX camera has been working out really well, sir. We're getting a lot of great film that will show a lot of people around the world how fragile the planet <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is in this big vastness of space and maybe help everybody to work to improve that. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Well, it's a good focus. There's so much interest today on the global environment and I think a lot of people will see just from your important mission the contribution that space exploration can make to the world's environment. We're grateful on that. A couple of more questions, I was interested because of the history of this, about the student experiments and how that was going. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON>: Well, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, the student experiments are going very well. Both of them are very well thought out. They have been going just as we expected. ... The data is looking very good and I think the students will have a lot good information to get out when we get back. -LRB- A student experiment by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vellinger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, studies effects of weightlessness on chicken embryos. Another by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fras </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, uses injured rats to study the effect of space on healing bones. -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: It is an inspiration to the Americans, I'll tell you, all of us. Today's pioneers. We're seeing you right now pointing the way for the young Americans to build our nation's future. Listen, all of you down there at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, I heard what <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> said, and while we're on the air to space, let me say to everyone at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> that you have our strong support. I know I speak for the vice president. The space program, especially space station Freedom, is an investment in our future. We living in a tough budgetary times, but I am determined to go forward with a strong active space program. And I want to congratulate you commander Coats and all of them for this wonderful, wonderful mission. We look forward to your safe return. And I think it wonderful that two Marines can get along with a guy from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and a civilian.

<HEAD>Metzenbaum: Corporations Shouldn't Make Older Workers Sign Away Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Older workers have been coerced into signing away their rights as corporations try to get rid of better-paid employees in favor of younger, lower-paid newcomers, three early retirees told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing Thursday. `` It is difficult for me to believe that an employee who works in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today ... who has been a loyal and successful worker for one employer for a long time, can be fired from his or her job and forced to sign away their rights under the law,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> `` If I had known more about the equal rights laws, and had known on Dec. 31, 1983 that my replacement was 28 years old, I would not have signed anything,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee on Labor. The subcommittee, headed by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, is considering Metzenbaum-sponsored legislation to forbid employers from asking older workers to waive their rights under the law as a condition of taking advantage of early retirement incentives. `` Three-fourths of employers do n't use waivers. Why do the other 25 percent have to?'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> survey of 60 `` Fortune 100'' companies showed 24 percent of the companies that had early retirement incentives required workers to sign waivers in order to get beefed-up benefits. The use of waivers has tripled over the past 10 years, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Delfico </PERSON> told the committee. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> told the panel no new law is needed because of regulatory action taken in 1987 aimed at accomplishing the same goal. But the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> survey showed 1987-88 was a peak period for the use of waivers. The companies surveyed by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, reported they used the waivers `` to avoid having terminated employees file claims and lawsuits after receiving enhanced benefits from exit incentive programs,'' <PERSON> Delfico </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON> said he was one year from being vested in his pension plan when the car dealership for which he was service manager fired him after 12 years on the job. In a New Year's Eve meeting, the dealership offered six months' severance pay in exchange for a signature on a release of all claims, <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON> said. `` I was given no reason for my termination. They had already hired someon in my place,'' <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON> told the panel. `` I was told I had to sign the release letter immediately in order to get the severance pay. `` I asked to take the documents home to review them, but they said no. I asked for time to talk to an attorney, but they said I did n't need to because the dealership's lawyers had already gone over everything,'' he said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, a draftsman, said he was told by his manager at <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> there was a `` 99 percent sure chance you will be laid off'' if an early retirement offer was refused. `` I had only seven working days to make a decision,'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said he was offered a year's salary if he signed documents waiving his rights under the Age Discrimination Employment Act. `` What happened to me should n't happen to anybody,'' he said. A law partner in a national firm testified that <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s proposal could hurt companies that have n't discriminated `` The real effect of -LRB- the bill -RRB- in individual cases would be to create a system whereby disputes could not be settled without the intervention of <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> or a court, and would put an end to many internal company grievance programs that have been developed over the years to deal with employee complaints,'' said attorney <PERSON> Cathie </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shattuck </PERSON>, who's represented both employers and disgruntled employees.

<HEAD>Non-Profit Group For Terminally Ill Children Closes Office Amid Questions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who founded a national group that grants wishes of dying children has closed an office and dropped from sight, raising questions about the status of the charity and the way she handled donations. <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> officials say they have n't spoken with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Girardin </PERSON> since December, shortly before she closed the two-room offices of A Child's <ORGANIZATION> Wish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Come </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I do n't know where she is,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinnott </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>. In 1985, the last year the charity filed financial statements with the state, the group reported it took in $ 400,000 but gave only one-third of the money to terminally ill children, <PERSON> Sinnott </PERSON> said. The BBB recommends that 60 percent of revenues should go to the stated purpose of the charity. `` We have just consistently reported that it has not measured up to the recommended amount of giving,'' she said. <PERSON> Girardin </PERSON> apparently has disconnected her telephone in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> and could not be reached for comment by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. <PERSON> Sinnott </PERSON> said she sent three letters to <PERSON> Girardin </PERSON> asking for updated information on the organization but never received the information. The group has in the past sponsored trips for ill children to <LOCATION> Disneyworld </LOCATION>. Several groups such as A Child's Wish Come True have sprung up in the past decade. While most of the groups are legitimate, the powerful fund-raising appeal of brightening a dying child's last days has posed some problems, charity officials said. `` Unfortunately, people have very open hearts and when you have a cause that sounds good and they get any kind of good publicity and people do n't check, then they tend to open their wallets,'' <PERSON> Sinnott </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Sunshine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> was investigated by the state attorney general's office, which criticized the foundation's handling of $ 34,000 in fund money. No charges were filed, but a new executive director was selected for the charity after a meeting between the foundation's board of directors and state officials. `` They're making progress towards bringing their accounting procedures in line with those of a responsible, not-for-profit corporation,'' Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Mollie </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the attorney general's office filed a civil suit in 1986 against a group called <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, after an investigation showed little of the money raised went to children, said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeser </PERSON>, deputy attorney general in charge of the charitable organizations division. `` The problem that we have with those organizations, as with a lot of organizations like this, -LRB- is -RRB- you ca n't track down your money,'' <PERSON> Reeser </PERSON> said. `` Anytime you deal with a dying child, it's a very compelling thing.'' The suit against <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> was dismissed after its founder died, <PERSON> Reeser </PERSON> said.

 If European countries do n't end a ban on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s hormone-treated beef, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commissaries there could stop buying <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s meat, two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee chairmen said Thursday.

The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> has been refusing to accept meat from livestock treated with growth hormones, while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the meat is not dangerous to humans. Last year, military commissaries sold 46 million pounds of European beef for $ 55 million, said <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> and de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>. Before the European ban on hormone-treated beef, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was selling about $ 100 million worth of beef in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Senate Won't Drop Impechment Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> refused Thursday to dismiss impeachment charges that federal District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> conspired to get a $ 150,000 bribe and later lied about it at his trial. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 92-1 against dismissal of 15 of the 17 articles of impeachment against the 52-year-old <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> judge. The lawmakers then voted 93-0 against dismissal of another article. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> had not sought dismissal of still another charge, that he disclosed information obtained from a federal wiretap and thus torpedoed a federal investigation of Miami-area corruption. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acted after 2 -LCB- hours of deliberation on the 52-year-old judge's move for dismissal of the charges on grounds that he had been acquitted in a 1983 trial and could not get a fair hearing in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> now in any case because too much time has passed. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, voted in favor of dismissal on the first of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' two motions, which would have dropped the first 15 of the articles of impeachment. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> was not reached immediately for comment, but press secretary <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON> said the senator had constitutional qualms about an impeachment trial on charges of which <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> already had been acquitted. `` Those were the counts on which he was acquitted and the senator had constitutional concerns about double jeopardy,'' <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s decision sets the stage for an impeachment trial expected to take as much as six weeks before a special <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. The panel's proceedings are to be videotaped for viewing by senators who lack time to sit through the lengthy presentation of evidence. The case then will come back to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for a vote on whether to remove <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from the bench and take away his $ 89,500 annual salary. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> himself on Wednesday took the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to make a personal appeal to the lawmakers to drop charges that he plotted to obtain the payoff and then committed perjury to win his 1983 acquittal. `` I proclaimed my innocence then as I have from the outset and as I do now,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> told the lawmakers. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, one of a panel of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> prosecutors, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> however that the judge's double-jeopardy defense did not apply to impeachment trials and that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> should forfeit his job because of `` his inexcusable breaches of the public trust.'' In contrast, the senators deliberated behind closed doors on Thursday and voted on <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' dismissal motion without any public debate. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> stands accused of conspiring with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> in 1981 to reduce from three-year prison sentences to probation the punishment of two brothers, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. They were convicted in <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' court of skimming from a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union pension fund loan. In return, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and Borders were to receive $ 150,000. The Romano brothers, both of whom have since died, refused to pay any bribe, but the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> mounted a sting-type operation and arrested Borders pulling out of a suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> motel with a garment bag containing $ 125,000 handed to him by an undercover agent masquerading as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>. Borders was convicted of conspiracy and went to prison. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted the articles of impeachment 413-3 on Aug. 3.

<TEXT>
 The traditional Palm Sunday procession in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was canceled on Thursday because of the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied lands. On the political front, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman said Thursday that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has been holding secret meetings with Palestinian leaders who do not belong to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> confirmed a report on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV that such meetings were under way. Israeli Arab leaders meanwhile called for a general strike by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 810,000 Arab residents on March 30 to support the rebellion, which has killed at least 396 Palestinians and 17 Israelis since it began on Dec. 8, 1987. Violence continued Thursday, with 40 Palestinians reported injured in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, most of them beaten by Israeli soldiers. The territories have been under Israeli control since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. A spokesman for Father <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, the first Arab Catholic patriarch of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said the Palm Sunday parade was called off this year, as it was last year, `` because it is not possible to have it with all the schools closed.'' Schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> have been closed since last year by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which considers them flashpoints for the uprising. Schoolchildren traditionally march in the parade, which commemorates <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' triumphal entrance into <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> amid waving palm fronds borne by his disciples. `` In the churches, everything will be held as usual,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers destroyed three Palestinian homes and sealed two others to punish anti-Israeli activists. That touched off demonstrations in which Palestinian youths burned tires, raised outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and hurled rocks at troops, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Soldiers opened fire at several protests, and one 16-year-old Palestinian was reported wounded. <PERSON> Ahli </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> hospitals in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> reported treating 35 Palestinians for beating injuries. The dynamited homes belonged to Palestinians arrested this month for allegedly belonging to an assassination team linked to <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the army said. Three <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> were shot and wounded in stone-throwing clashes with soldiers, including two teen-agers shot in the legs in <LOCATION> Kabatiya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. A Palestinian shop in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> were set ablaze by fellow Palestinians for selling Israeli-made goods, police said. No injuries were reported. Leaders of the uprising have repeatedly called on store owners to boycott Israeli goods. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya refugee camp, troops late Wednesday night bulldozed the home of <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mor </PERSON>, a Palestinian lawyer wanted by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities for allegedly heading <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, a fundamentalist Moslem group, the army said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> objects to the destruction of homes as undue punishment, especially when the activists have not been tried in court. The strike call to Israeli Arabs was issued at a meeting in <LOCATION> Shaferam </LOCATION>. Arab Israeli leaders said businesses will be closed and rallies will be held on March 30 `` to protest against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government discrimination against <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> citizens and to show solidarity with the people in the occupied territories.'' The March 30 date commemorates a 1976 incident in which six Arabs were killed in the <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> in clashes over land expropriations by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> meanwhile told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Thursday that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s meetings with Palestinians started last December `` Its purpose is to have a dialogue with non-PLO Palestinians. He has been meeting with non-PLO Palestinians, and he will continue to do so,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said. He declined to identify the Palestinians, saying `` it could endanger their lives.'' His disclosure came a day after <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, reacted strongly and negatively to suggestions by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> consider talks directly with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> if other peace avenues fail. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> is in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in advance of an expected April trip by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>.

 The Communist Party approved sweeping agricultural reforms Thursday, giving farmers long leases on state land to produce more of the meat, fruit and fresh vegetables for which housewives now wait in line for hours. An average Soviet citizen now consumes about half as much meat and fruit as an American, but up to double the sugar and potatoes. <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the ruling Politburo's man in charge of farm policy, promised the people diets `` up to generally recognized standards of nutrition'' by 1996. `` We are not promising something that we can not achieve,'' he told his first news conference with foreign reporters. `` We will be able to change the food situation for the better.'' The meeting of the 300-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also elected the party's 100 members to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, a new 2,550-seat legislative body that will meet for the first time in the spring. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was among them. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had proposed that farmers be given long-term leases on land so they would become more efficient. He also urged that they be allowed to decide what to plant on the land rather than having the bureaucracy decide. Western analysts have said the new system will do little good unless lease-holders are allowed to choose which crops to plant, set their own prices and make other decisions. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said leases could be signed for any period of more than five years and be passed on succeeding generations of a family. He said no one would be forced to lease land and that the giant state and collective farms would remain the backbone of the Soviet agricultural system. `` Radical changes in rural life and production relations should be carried out on a purely voluntary basis ... without any kind of force or repressive methods,'' said <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, 68, who is widely regarded as a conservative force in the Politburo. Setting targets for leasing would only encourage strong-arm tactics to fulfill the plans, he said. In statements at the meeting, leasing was only one of many methods for improving production. He said the new approach to agriculture also would include self-financing, and greater democracy in rural life. State and collective farms still will dominate agriculture, he said. Some Soviet press reports have come close to advocating they be scrapped, but <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said none of the 12 Politburo members favor it. `` Any proposal that leads to abolishing state and collective farms has no foundation whatsoever,'' he declared. Even when land is leased to individuals and groups, he said, state and collective farms will oversee production, `` proceeding from the needs and possibilities of society.'' Soviet television showed an hour-long report on the meeting, including speeches by local and Moscow-based officials echoing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s calls for agriculture. The meeting abolished the giant superministry in charge of agricultural policy, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> interrupted its chief, <PERSON> Vsevolod </PERSON> <PERSON> Murakovsky </PERSON>, who favored the traditional system in which all local regions are required to send a percentage of their harvest to central authorities. The television, breaking with its ususal practice, cut off its report before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gave his final statement to the plenum. Ususally <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s statements in televised forums constitute the main part of the TV report. In a nearly two-hour speech Wednesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> painted a devastating picture of Soviet agriculture, with chemically spoiled land, investments gone sour and destruction of systems prevalent in the 1920s. He said food shortages were inadmissible. `` The shortage of food creates social tension and generates not merely criticism but actual discontent.'' He said conditions in villages in some regions were so bad that emigration to the cities had reached a `` critical level.'' When <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> forced agricultural collectivization in the 1930s on a populace that was 80 percent agrarian, millions of peasants were deported to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and other remote regions or fled to cities. Catastrophic famine ensued. Ever since, farmers working for state-owned farms have generally delivered their yields to market at fixed prices to meet quotas set by the state bureaucracy.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Thursday that despite his sometimes harsh rhetoric _ which has contrasted with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s _ he is not a lightning rod for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> was for President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Playing on a memorable campaign exchange between himself and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he had asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> comparison, made by more than one <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> watcher. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paraphrased <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s line during last fall's vice presidential debate attacking <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for comparing himself to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in a quip that drew appreciative laughter from his audience at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` He put his hand on my shoulder. He said, ` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, I knew <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>. <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> was a friend of mine, and you're no <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>,''' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> reiterated his attack on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for its rejection of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s defense secretary nominee, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, saying that `` smear information'' was used. Last week, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> went further, saying in an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> speech that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of Tower signaled a legislative attack on the power of the presidency and a return to the tactics of the <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> era. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own rhetoric about his first major defeat in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since becoming president was decidedly milder. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the episode was `` history'' and he wanted to move forward with good relations. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that when he made the accusation in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, he was not performing the <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> tough-guy role to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nice guy. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> drew fire with his pungent speeches that often criticizing the media and liberals in general. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said senators who knew Tower and had served with him relied on other witnesses and unsubstantiated rumors instead of their own knowledge of the man. And he offered another theory about Tower's defeat. `` I do believe we're starting to set a new standard. What brought down <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> was probably more on the likeability issue, that he simply was not well-liked. I do n't believe that is a criteria to be used for whether the president ought to have the right to have his person as secretary of defense.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also defended the new administration's pace, which has been criticized as too slow. `` We're succeeding an administration of our own party at a time when the country is in good shape ... so we're certainly not going to be stampeded into doing things for the sake of doing them soon, or quickly, or to show ` momentum' or some such thing.'' `` Quick fixes are often bad fixes,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also criticized politicians' `` frantic efforts to gain press attention,'' but said he was not referring to the media-wise campaign that elected him and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last fall. He said the political process is distorted when `` the need to make the 7 o'clock news can lead politicians to announce initiatives that really are n't well thought out _ initiatives that might well make the headlines, but might not be very good for the health of the country.'' Asked about the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> campaign's acknowledged management of the daily news, packaging events and keeping the candidates away from reporters to keep from cluttering the canned message, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was not talking about campaigns but added: `` You've got a certain message you want to get across.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was criticizing `` the way frantic efforts to gain press attention and produce sound bites can distort our political process by elevating form over substance, and image over reality.'' As to the blistering press reports about his own background that percolated throughout the campaign, the vice president said he probably benefited from it in the long run. He said the intense scrutiny was to be expected because he had been a little-known senator outside his home state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked him for a running mate. `` You're an open target to criticism by your opposition. That is the way we conduct our campaigns,'' he said. `` It's healthy to see how one musters the scrutiny. I believe I have emerged a stronger and better person because of it. It's an experience that had a meaningful purpose for me as being the vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

 Moslem gunners blasted <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s port Thursday, setting a cargo ship and a warehouse afire in fierce battles with Christian forces around the capital. No casualties were reported. Artillery duels in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and in the mountains above the capital coincided with a nationwide strike staged by Moslems to mourn victims of the previous week of fighting, which police said left 49 people killed and 161 wounded. A Syrian official was quoted as saying an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee has canceled a third meeting between rival Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinets </ORGANIZATION> to end the violence. A police spokesman said Moslem gunners blasted the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> port with 25 rockets, setting fire to a cargo ship that tried to return from open waters during a lull in the fighting. The spokesman identified the stricken vessel as `` The Angie Wipp'' and said he could not give any details about its flag, owners or what kind of cargo it carried. One of the port's warehouses also took a direct rocket hit during the attacks, said the spokesman, who can not be further identified under standing regulations. Christian gunners fired a barrage of 155mm howitzer fire at the Moslem residential districts of <PERSON> Sabra </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kasskass </LOCATION> abutting <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, said a police spokesman Sniper fire and occasional grenade blasts crackled across the ruins of the old commercial district. The police spokesman said the new hostilities in <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION>, 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, erupted shortly before sundown between Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces, which hold the town, and Druse fighters on nearby hills. The town commands a network of mountain roads leading from Druse territory to the Christian heartland north and northeast of the capital. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces appeared to be following through with his stated intention to drive <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The Christian-run Ad-Diyar newspaper on Thursday quoted an unidentifed Syrian official as saying that <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> `` has not yet taken a decision to retaliate against Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> ... But if <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> should continue his provocations, retaliation will be decisive.'' The official was quoted as saying Arab League peace talks will not be held. The fighting was sparked by a March 6 air-and-sea blockade <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> clamped on illegal harbors run by Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The blockade angered <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, whose party runs two illegal port facilities. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> vowed to bombard the Christian-run <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> port as long as the blockade of Druse harbors was maintained. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s commerical sea traffic was virtually halted and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the nation's only air gateway, has been shut since Saturday. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 53, heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> cabinet that has been vying for legitimacy with acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' Moslem cabinet. The rival governments have been in place since <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed to elect a successor to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> when his term ended in September.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rules Utah Must Allow Sweat Lodges For Indian Inmates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A two-year legal battle over the state's refusal to allow ceremonial sweat lodges for Indian inmates at <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> ended Thursday when a federal judge ruled the ban is unconstitutional Applause broke out in the packed courtroom and American Indians from several different tribes chanted and pounded drums outside after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> struck down the ban in a bench ruling on motions for summary judgment. `` I'm grateful. The words are kind of hard to come by at this time because the feeling is so good,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Assiniboine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sioux </PERSON> who, as a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> prison inmate in March 1987, initiated the lawsuit with five other inmates. `` What this thing is all about is us trying to help our people to help themselves,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> had contended the sweat lodge, which tribal officials contend is central to purification and ceremonial rites dating back 40,000 years, threatened security because the lodge must be dark and enclosed. But <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> cited two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings and the success of sweat lodges in 19 other state prison systems and two federal penitentiaries in rejecting arguments that the small willow and canvas structures posed a security risk. The judge said the prohibition was unreasonable and resulted in `` the Native American religion not being accommodated to the extent other religions are.'' `` The sweat lodge will simply be another chapel located within the prison,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, an attorney representing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said guards could monitor ceremonies and prison officials could impose limitations such as searches and requirements that the lodge be dismantled after each service. `` The record is clear that 19 other states and the federal prison system accommodate these sweat lodges without risk to security,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. Telephone messages left at the office of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Tesch </PERSON>, the associate <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> attorney general who defended the case for the state, were not immediately returned. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> was one of several groups that provided legal or moral support to the inmates' cause. The Native American Rights Fund and the giant <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> also joined the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, while the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, representing pastors from six denominations, urged Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> to intervene on the inmates' behalf. Prison officials had earlier offered to allow a modified sweat lodge equipped with a window and mechanical heating, instead of the required heated rocks, but plaintiffs' attorney <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> called the suggestion `` blasphemous.'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> concurred, telling Associate Utah Attorney General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Tesch </PERSON>, at one point, `` It's like saying to a Christian you can have a ceremony but do n't mention Christ.'' Attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>, which manages sweat lodge programs for 500 inmates in federal and state systems, argued that the ceremonies are vital to rehabilitation. The sweat lodge provides a link between the incarcerated Indian inmate and his tribe, and the program administered by the Navajos offers drug and alcohol counseling in addition to spiritual guidance, said Navajo lawyer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Sales Of Non-Chilean Fruit Dip In Some Places; Consumers Called More
Careful</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The scare over tampering of fresh fruit from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has reduced sales of all fruit at some markets, but others reported Thursday that consumers are asking more questions but not cutting back much on their shopping lists. `` Consumers definitely do n't want any fruit from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and we do n't offer any fruit from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. They pick up apples from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and ask if they're from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneddon </PERSON>, co-owner of <LOCATION> Fairway </LOCATION>, a large <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> fruit market. On Monday, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urged consumers not to eat Chilean fruit after two grapes imported from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> were found to be tainted with a small amount of cyanide. Most Chilean fruit was pulled from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market shelves. The finding of the tainted fruit followed anonymous calls to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> earlier this month from a man who threatened to inject cyanide into <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s export fruit. Officials had concluded the first call was apparently a hoax after precautionary inspections revealed no sign of tampering. But when a second call was received March 8, saying the threat was not a hoax, further inspections turned up two tainted, seedless red grapes in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on Sunday. Unlike some other grocers, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, produce manager at the <PERSON> Byerly </PERSON>'s grocery store in <LOCATION> Edina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said he had seen a drop in fruit sales, even types that are not grown in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. `` I've noticed some melon sales slowing down even though they are n't even from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, and even with bananas, which was a real shocker since they are grown nowhere near <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This has created a certain air of uncertainty about buying fruit.'' `` Sales have slowed down quite a bit,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, adding that a drop in fruit sales was particularly important to grocers because of the jump of interest in fresh fruit recent years as consumers have become more health-conscious. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sneddon </PERSON> said consumers were still buying fruit `` as long as we confirm for them it's not from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' He estimated that overall his business is down only about `` five thousand bucks or something like that.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Balducci </ORGANIZATION>'s, an upscale specialty market in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, produce department manager <PERSON> Gino </PERSON> <PERSON> Roselli </PERSON> said his business was off about 10 percent, but he said that was due mainly to higher prices for fruit from sources other than <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, not to a general fear of tampering <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gowin </PERSON>, vice president for consumer and public affairs at Shop Rite, a national chain based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, said Chilean fruit accounts for about 15 percent of the chain's fruit sales at this time of year, so `` we still have 85 percent to work with.'' `` People are very cautious and concerned,'' she said. `` We recognize that.'' The company has posted signs in produce departments and is displaying shipping containers showing the fruits' country of origin, she said, and sales of non-Chilean products are holding up well. `` Consumers like fruit and will substitute. They are very understanding,'' she said. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMay </PERSON>, co-owner of <PERSON> Tait </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Super </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valu </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, said the reaction to the Chilean threat could invite more of the same. `` The next guy will do it to bananas or lettuce,'' he said. `` But the biggest part of the problem is that the customers' confidence is going to be further eroded in their belief in our food safety system.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Loffredo </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Loffredo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Produce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> food wholesaler, questioned whether officials overreacted. `` It's just been blown out of proportion,'' <PERSON> Loffredo </PERSON> said. Fruits imported from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> include grapes, nectarines, peaches, plums, apricots, pears, <PERSON> Granny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> apples, cherries, raspberries, blueberries, cantaloupe and honeydew melons. Substitute sources are available for most types of fruit except for grapes, virtually all of which come from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> at this time of year.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ante </PERSON> <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> took office as premier Thursday and promised market-oriented reforms to rescue <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> from an economic decline that began with the death of President <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> in 1980. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>, a successful businessman, said in his inaugural speech a free-market economy is the `` ultimate achievement of mankind, for which no alternative has yet been found.'' He also said `` there is no solution to the economic crisis without the strengthening of political democracy in the country,'' and advocated creation of `` a new modern socialist system.'' A new Cabinet, much trimmer than before, also was sworn in. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>'s government has 19 ministers, compared to 29 under <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>, who resigned Dec. 30 because his government could not resolve the economic crisis. This Balkan nation of 23 million must undergo `` fundamental change'' in order achieve economic revival, <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> said. Inflation has reached an annual rate of 346 percent, and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> owes $ 21 billion to foreign creditors. Labor unrest and ethnic conflict have become chronic. Much of the recent ethnic trouble has involved the southern province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where ethnic Albanians form a majority of 90 percent. About 2,000 Albanian miners have been on strike in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> for nearly a month. The government raised the prices of gasoline and diesel fuel Thursday for the third time this year, by an average of 18.7 percent, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. Yugoslavs, whose average monthly pay is equivalent to $ 120, now must pay about $ 1.82 a gallon for gasoline. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> indicated he would seek closer links to the West, including greater economic cooperation with the European Economic Community. He advocates reshaping the banking system along Western lines, creating a stock market and ending state subsidies to companies that lose money. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> left the Soviet bloc in 1948 and is a founding member of the organization of nations that profess non-alignment. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>'s government was the first to resign since the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gained power after World War II. The new one is a mix of prominent politicians and technocrats, with only two ministers retaining the seats they occupied in <LOCATION> Mikulic </LOCATION>'s government. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Budimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Loncar </PERSON> and the defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Veljko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadijevic </PERSON>, carry over but Defense Minister <PERSON> Dobrosav </PERSON> <PERSON> Culafic </PERSON> lost his job. <PERSON> Culafic </PERSON> was severely criticized for his handling of ethnic strife in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, the ancient heart of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. The remaining Serbian minority accuses the ethnic Albanians of discrimination. Gen. <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gracanin </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, is the new interior minister. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> is the largest of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics, and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is an autonomous province within it.

 In a second blow to maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> in the waning days of his parliamentary election campaign, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> began an investigation Thursday of allegations that he opposes some party positions. The decision on the final day of a meeting of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> indicated more trouble ahead for <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. It came two days after publication in a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> journal of the November 1987 speech that got him fired as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 58, is running for election March 26 to the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and has said the campaign marks his political rehabilitation. In the 1987 speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said faith in <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms was waning and the leader was becoming the subject of `` intolerable'' glorification. <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, chief Kremlin ideologist, told a news conference Thursday a panel was formed to investigate <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s views after complaints were received from Central Committee members He said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikhomirov </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> worker and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member, complained about <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s view of the role of the party, about the bureaucracy <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> heads in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and about discourtesy toward <PERSON> Tikhomirov </PERSON>. Other party officials said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> `` expressed some views that stood at variance with the party line and those messages received by the plenary meeting suggested the issue be formally discussed,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> defended himself against charges that he advocates a multiparty system, the ideologist said, but also told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he wants the issue discussed in the official press. Although he still is a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member and serves as first deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> is campaigning as an outsider for a seat representing all <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. His opponent is director of the giant ZIL auto company. He has demanded an end to special privileges for party and government officials; extension of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness, and more economic reform. He remains popular with many Muscovites, who wear buttons supporting him. In a debate televised Sunday night, <PERSON> Yelstin </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party organization he formerly led of conspiring against his candidacy. In a speech a week ago, he accused the local party of restricting voter access to his appearances. The weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said in its latest edition an anonymous 11-page criticism of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was being distributed at some local party heaquarters.

 The wife of the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> skipper agreed Thursday to quit teaching at a private school because her narrow escape from a bomb attack prompted fears that students could be exposed to terrorist acts. Parents worried that their children at the exclusive La Jolla Country Day School might be endangered if <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> returned to teach her fourth-grade class, and they told their concerns known to administrators. `` To ensure the safety of the children, the confidence of the parents, and the integrity of the educational environment of La Jolla Country Day School, Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> and the school have reached the mutual decision that she will not be returning to the campus,'' headmaster <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said in a statement. The school was the target of a bomb scare on Tuesday. Police searched the grounds and found nothing. Extra precautions have been taken at the campus, including daily searches of classrooms by school personnel before the children's arrival and the posting of security guards at the entrance gate. School spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> declined to go beyond <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' statement except to say officials at the school were grateful Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was unhurt in the bombing He would not say whether Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> told her pupils about the decision during a conference call. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> survived the bombing of the family van unhurt as she drove to work alone last Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the bombing as a possible terrorist act in retaliation for the mistaken downing last July of an Iranian airliner by the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which is commanded by her husband, Capt.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday moved to deflect criticism that his administration is off to a slow start, declaring `` more is going on than meets the eye.'' In his first trip back to his adopted home state since the inauguration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was grappling with `` ticking time bombs that we need to defuse without delay. And we're doing just that.'' He mentioned the savings and loan industry, burgeoning debt in the Third World and drug abuse in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a luncheon speech that his administration was working on `` an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agenda for the long term.'' In the speech and a question-and-answer session that followed, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also: _ Called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to move more quickly on his plan to shore up troubled savings and loans, saying `` there's no excuse for delay. _ Declared himself `` very pleased'' that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had voted approval of his new defense secretary nominee, Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, but also complained anew that his rejected first choice, former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, was `` tried by perception and rumor That is not the American way.'' But in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, released an unclassified <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report which said a background investigation of Tower had turned up `` a prior pattern of alcohol abuse.'' It was reports about Tower's drinking and relations with women, along with his acceptance of consulting fees from defense contractors, that led to his defeat. _ Firmly restated his opposition to Democratic-backed efforts to raise the minimum wage to $ 4.65 an hour, saying his own plan for a maximum $ 4.25 wage with a lower `` training wage'' was `` my first and last offer. _ Said in regard to the emotional issue of restrictions on semiautomatic weapons, `` I do want to find a solution to the so-called AK-47 assault weapon problem _ one that protects the rights of the legitimate sportsman but also protects the lives of our police officers who are laying their lives on the line. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president supports the action Wednesday of Colt Industries to suspend sales to the public of its AR-47 semiautomatic rifle, the civilian version of the military M-16. `` He thinks it's a reasonable move on their part,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, the administration announced it would suspend the import of most foreign-made semiautomatic rifles. In addition to saying he was pursuing his agenda at his own speed, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he was not going to be forced into moving more quickly in dealings with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He said recent changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` are profound.'' `` But we're facing a challenge. We've got to figure it out. We've got to measure Soviet intentions and then move,'' he said On another foreign policy issue, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had decided in principal to go ahead with a proposed joint venture with the Japanese for the production in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of a new version of the F-16 fighter. However, the spokesman said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must still decide on safeguards to prevent the loss of sensitive technology and that a final decision may not come until next week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his audience at the <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, `` I've come home to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to tell you we're hard at work in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ and we're making progress.''

When he arrived at 6,800-foot high <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> immediately went to a local high school and did seven laps _ walking and jogging _ around a quarter-mile track. As he passed a group of reporters, the president threw up his arms and said, `` no air.'' Embargoed for 10:35 p.m. EST

 Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> focused on educational issues in a speech to the Junior Achievement National Business Hall of Fame dinner in <LOCATION> Colordado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` I ca n't think of any issue that is larger _ or more far-ranging in its impact than the education of our youth,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in prepared remarks. `` When it comes to our nation's future, education is the key. It's the best investment we can make,'' he said. End Embargoed Material Before leaving on his two-day western trip, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked to the Discovery shuttle astronauts _ `` today's pioneers'' _ from the Oval Office, inviting them to the White House upon their return and promising `` a strong, active space program'' despite budget constraints. Eight weeks into his administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been the target of criticism in the Democratic-led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he has failed to move quickly enough on an agenda. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday, `` In this kind of work, more is going on than meets the eye _ or makes the headlines.'' `` The proof will come when we look back from the year 2000. And I'm confident that we will be able to look back with pride on work we did to get ready for a new century _ provided we look forward today.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also defended the new administration's pace, saying, `` We're succeeding an administration of our own party at a time when the country is in good shape ... so we're certainly not going to be stampeded into doing things for the sake of doing them soon, or quickly, or to show ` momentum' or some such thing.'' `` Quick fixes are often bad fixes,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> added, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rattled off a variety of positions his administration has advanced _ ranging from a new child-care tax break he offered on Wednesday to month-old legislation to rescue the nation's troubled savings and loan industry, a prime issue in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, home to many of the nation's insolvent S & amp; Ls. He said S & amp; L officials `` guilty of criminal actions'' must be `` pursued and punished.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the S & amp; L crisis was among the `` time bombs'' that need to be defused, and he pressed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to move more quickly to pass his plan `` with its central provisions intact.'' Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday his committee plans to act on an S & amp; L bill by April 14 and is pressing for a full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote by April 21 `` We're going as fast as we can within the bounds of doing the job properly,'' <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said. Some congressional debate focuses on the cost of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan. The White House contends it would cost taxpayers $ 40 billion; a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report puts the price closer to $ 100 billion. Insolvent S & amp; Ls still in operation are incurring losses of $ 300 million a month, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, or `` almost $ 1 million dollars during the course of this luncheon.''

<HEAD>Republicans Block Senate Debate on Eastern Airlines Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republican lawmakers blocked Democratic efforts Thursday night to have the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consider legislation that would require President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike. The procedural standoff made it likely that the measure, passed Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, could not come to a vote until after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s two-week Easter recess, which begins Saturday. The bill would force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to name an emergency board to recommend a solution to the strike, and would impose a cooling-off period of up to 26 days during which the airline's employees would receive pre-strike wages. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes the bill, arguing the dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its unions should be settled directly between the two sides, and administration officials have said the measure would be vetoed. After hours of closed-door talks between legislators from the two parties, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, tried to commence debate on the measure, arguing that steps should be taken to end the two-week old walkout. `` The federal government should not simply sit by waiting for something to happen,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Republicans blocked that effort, using procedures under which an individual lawmaker can prevent the consideration of a bill. They argued the measure should be studied for at least a week by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, saying the situation was complicated by potential efforts to buy the airline and by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s filing for protection from creditors under the bankruptcy code. `` There is a desire for us not to bottle this thing up forever,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., would not say that Republicans would filibuster the measure, under which lengthy debate is used in an effort to kill a bill But he said, `` Debate would be intense.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he would seek a vote after the Easter recess that would prevent a filibuster. Such a vote would require 60 votes from the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, in which Democrats have 55 members. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the union-supported bill by a 252-167 vote, with all but 20 votes coming from its majority Democrats.

 The defense minister and presidential candidates on Thursday condemned a paralyzing transport ban declared by leftist rebels and urged voters to reject guerrilla violence by going to the polls Sunday. `` We have enough evidence of the Salvadoran people's courage to know that they will go out to vote on Sunday,'' Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vides </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON> said in a television interview. There was virtually no traffic on the streets as the guerrilla transport ban took effect at midnight Wednesday. Officials discovered tiny, sharp three-pronged devices scattered on city streets early Thursday. The army said it was providing protection for travelers on 80 percent of the country's highways but acknowledged late Thursday that the traffic ban was 90 percent effective. `` It is not support for the ban, but fear that kept the buses off the highways,'' said an army spokesman on usual condition of anonymity. There were no additional reports of armed rebel activity late in the day. Most businesses in the capital were open, but customers were few. The <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella coalition of five groups fighting the U.S.-backed government, decreed the ban after the failure of negotiations over its offer to participate in the election. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> has no right to prevent the people from voting,'' declared <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, candidate of the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, candidate of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convergence </ORGANIZATION>, condemned the rebels for engaging in violence after having offered to join the political process. `` They want to jump in bed but still remain a virgin,'' said Ungo, whose alliance maintained close links with the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> and gives voters the opportunity to vote for a leftist presidential candidate for the first time since 1979. The other top candidate is <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or Arena. Polls show <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> gathering the largest share of Sunday's vote, but there is a high possibility for error due to the reluctance of many people to give their views. In a statement released in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the guerrillas said the election was an attempt to legitimize the war and to `` justify continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms shipments and aid.'' The statement said the election would be a fraud in which the military would control `` the votes and the results.'' However, the rebel statement also said working for <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON> was a `` valid option.'' <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s vice presidential candidate, said the rebel ban and the wave of violence `` are an illogical mistake of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` They had been given an opportunity to show their sincerity in the proposal for peace. Their leadership is showing that they have no intention of paying attention to this call we and the people and the international community have made on them,'' Merino said. Nearly 1.8 million voters are registered to vote for president and vice president. In addition to the top three, there are four minor party candidates. If no candidate receives more than 50 percent on Sunday, the top two vote-getters will face each other in a runoff. The winner will take over the presidency from <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, on June 1. The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday urged all government election officials to quit their jobs, and their guerrillas attacked a coffee storage facility and sabotaged electrical power lines. One soldier was killed and four others wounded during a rebel attack, the armed forces press office said. Appealing for calm, <PERSON> Vides </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON> said, `` We are going to hear some bombs, and we are going to see sabotage and they will make us a bit nervous.'' <PERSON> Vides </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON> acknowledged the rebels were capable of causing disruptions and referred to guerrilla sabotage during elections in 1982 and 1985. `` It is easy to disrupt electricity or to throw a bomb. They have done that in the past,'' he said. The rebels boycotted previous elections this decade, saying the voting was little more than part of a U.S.-designed counterinsurgency strategy. Still, as many as 75 percent of eligible voters went to the polls in 1985. The guerrillas offered to take part in elections if they were postponed and other guarantees were put in place, but negotiations with the political parties and the government stalled. The army provided trucks under military escort to transport capital residents, while a few private pickup trucks volunteered their services. Eight armored vehicles escorted a four-truck convoy carrying passengers along a highway from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to towns to the east. `` The armed forces are here to protect you from the terrorists of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>,'' a loudspeaker blared as the convoy departed a bus terminal. Previous bans have been effective because the guerrillas sabotage or burn vehicles that violate it. Reports from the countryside indicated the ban had virtually paralyzed traffic outside the capital.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it issued two warnings of a bomb plot in the month before <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 blew up over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, but the airline said Thursday it never received the first warning and the second arrived weeks late, by mail. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> reported Thursday night that police know the bomber's identity and will disclose details next week. But authorities denied reports in a British tabloid that a suspect was arrested. Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said the second warning, two days before the Dec. 21 crash, was `` of no importance whatsoever,'' because the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> already issued its own warning to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers about the threat. Members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> accused the government of a cover-up and demanded an investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued its statement Wednesday night after a newspaper report of the warnings. The warnings issued by the British government Nov. 22 and Dec. 19, just two days before the disaster that killed 270 people, spoke of a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player, the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Police say they established that the explosives were in a radio-cassette player planted in a suitcase stowed in the jumbo jet's hold. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Dec. 19 memo did not reach it until Jan. 17 and that it never received the Nov. 22 warning. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, company spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> acknowledged <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> did receive the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> warning Nov. 18 and as a result `` put into place some heightened security procedures,'' but she declined to elaborate. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, changing to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It blew up over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. The Times reported in its Friday issue, early copies of which were available Thursday night: `` Police and security service investigators now know precisely who made and placed the bomb and the whereabouts of the bomber. `` The results of what <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- British government -RRB- sources term ` one of the most remarkable feats of criminal detection ever known' are expected to be disclosed next week `` It is understood that Mr. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> has already discussed the findings in outline with Dr. <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON>, his West German counterpart,'' the Times said without giving any further details. Authorities denied a report Friday by the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tabloid Today that said the terrorist who planted the bomb was under arrest `` somewhere in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' A police spokesman in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> domestic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said he knew nothing about any terrorists being held in connection with the bombing. A spokesman at the Scottish Office, the British government department responsible for <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, described the report as `` pure speculation.'' A photostat of the Dec. 19 warning published by the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> showed it addressed to `` All <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> airlines -LRB- and <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, South African Airways -RRB-.'' The Mirror said the notice advised security authorities to look for telltale signs: that the instrument would n't play, its insides would rattle, the X-ray would show more wiring than usual and the antenna socket would be taped shut. Suspicions of a bomb plot arose in October when West German police caught a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorist group with a radio-cassette player containing explosives and a barometric device that would detonate a bomb at high altitude, according to British and West German officials. `` We sent advice to the relevant security authorities,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in its statement. `` They were told what to look for. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities would have done the same for American airlines.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the arrests in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also prompted the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> issued a warning Nov. 18 that told of the terrorist group, `` the existence of this bomb, its characteristics, and to advise that increased security measures should be introduced to counter this threat.'' `` This bulletin remains in effect today,'' he added. On Dec. 5, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> was warned in a telephone call of a plot to bomb a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> airliner on a Frankfurt-U.S. flight during a two-week period in December. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> issued an `` intelligence alert'' that there might be a bomb attempt against a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. Speaking on BBC-TV, <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said the Nov. 22 warning was sent to British airlines and airports, `` and of course the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> sent out their own warning to the American airlines.'' Asked about <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s statement that it did n't get the second warning until Jan. 17, <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said: `` There is no importance to it whatsoever. All it contained, virtually, was a color photograph of a cassette player and a few more unimportant pieces of information about how a bomb in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> had been constructed.'' He said the evidence that the bomb was placed aboard the plane at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> `` is very slender _ indeed all the evidence seems to point the other way.'' Asked if this meant he was blaming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and West German authorities for failing to prevent the bombing, he said: `` I do n't make any comment about that That's for the investigators to decide and for the police.'' West German authorities say there is no firm evidence that the bomb was smuggled aboard in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Langendorf </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Hesse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s office for airport security, said Thursday all airlines operating in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ including <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> _ were told in early November about the radio-cassette player containing explosives. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilshire </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who follows air transport affairs, denied suggestions authorities simply dropped a highly sensitive warning into the Christmas mail deluge. He said the Dec. 19 warning was sent by telex and the mailed versions were courtesy copies. He said that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, in any case, had received one of the November warnings. <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> said security officials at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> built a mock bomb after the Nov. 22 warning to run through X-ray machines, but added that the machines scan only carry-on bags and airlines are responsible for checked luggage. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> transport spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> said the government's responses were `` just not good enough. The government are covering up. ... Let's have a public inquiry.'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Delude-Dix </PERSON>, an American whose Irish husband was killed on Flight 103, said: `` I'm bewildered and also very angry. `` Now we know that the government had information which told them the carrier that would be affected _ Pan American; the origin of the flight _ <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>; that the threatened period was during the month of December, and now we've learned that they also had information about the exact kind of bomb that was used.'' If security authorities had `` only looked at all the information at their disposal they could perhaps have prevented this,'' she said.

 Advocates for the homeless and state and congressional housing experts on Wednesday criticized a federal panel charged with coordinating programs for the homeless, saying it had done virtually nothing to provide shelter for people without housing. The complaints about the <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on the Homeless came at a joint hearing of two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees Wednesday, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on housing introduced legislation its sponsors touted as the `` framework for a new national housing strategy.'' The litany of the council's failures began in the opening statement from Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., who chairs the Government Activities and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations `` It did n't hold meetings; it did n't set policy; it did n't coordinate federal programs; it did n't assess the needs of the homeless; it did n't recommend legislative changes or funding levels,'' said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> It `` has failed almost completely to carry out the mandates set for it by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. The council, established in 1987 by Title II of the McKinney Act, was given the responsibility to coordinate 20 new programs created by the law, monitor implementation of programs to the homeless, disseminate information about the programs to local governments and non-profit organizations serving the homeless, and help them develop new programs. But Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the Employment and Housing subcommittee and co-host of Wednesday's hearing said much of the information that homeless providers needed to apply for <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> funds was provided instead by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION> testified that after receiving numerous requests from the states for information, she had developed and updated three times a report on the status of programs under the <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> act and related legislation. `` This publication contains the type of information the council should be disseminating,'' said <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, chiding the council for not fulfilling `` its most basic mandate.'' Other witnesses said the council has failed to develop a complete staff, identify regional and field coordinators for programs and to clarify their duties, focused too much on the development of an electronic data base which homeless providers could not use, missed application deadlines, met only five times in 18 months, and produced only three monthly newsletters which contained useless information. The council, comprised of the heads or their designees of 10 Cabinet departments and five independent agencies, was headed by former housing secretary <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> joked that the late <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> had been seen more often on Capitol Hill than <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. `` The duties with which the council is charged and its ability to carry them out must be brought into balance,'' said <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the council's former executive director. She said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave the council broad authority to develop programs and issue timetables, but not the power or resources to fulfill its mandate as described in <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> also recommended increasing the staff size and removing the council from under the administrative wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. She said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> had been resistant to sharing information on homelessness and virtually non-communicative. But <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> had provided administrative support to the council on a continuing basis, according to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimpson </PERSON>, a deputy assistant housing secretary. He said the new administration has made homelessness one of its highest priorities and sees the council as `` an effective partner'' in addressing the problem.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s hawkish industry minister and former defense chief, <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, said Thursday that <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> should be killed and the Israeli army should destroy his <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, who was architect of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s disastrous 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, demanded a worldwide Jewish effort to end the dialogue between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Palestinians. `` Our goal must be their -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- destruction,'' the outspoken <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said in an interview on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` We should have killed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> long ago.'' He was among right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers from Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s political party, the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, who rejected on Thursday a suggestion by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But a leading Palestinian figure on Thursday praised <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s comment <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, second in command to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the main <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, described as `` positive'' and `` practical'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s statement before a congressional hearing that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might have to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` Not bad, not bad at all, Mr. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON>, was quoted as saying in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> with the London-based newsletter Mideast Mirror. A copy of the interview was telexed to The Associated Press. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, disclosed on Thursday that the prime minister has been holding secret meetings since last December with Palestinian leaders who do not belong to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> confirmed a report on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV that secret meetings were under way. He told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, `` Its purpose is to have a dialogue with non-PLO Palestinians. He has been meeting with non-PLO Palestinians, and he will continue to do so.'' He declined to identify the Palestinians, saying `` it could endanger their lives.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, had reacted strongly to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s suggestions that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> consider talks directly with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> if other peace avenues fail. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, who is visiting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before an expected April trip by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, expressed his displeasure with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s statements to congresssional committees in a 20-minute telephone call to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s talks should not be misconstrued as support for <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s suggestion. `` There will be no negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> repeatedly has rejected all talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, contending it is a terrorist group. But he says he is willing to talk with non-PLO Palestinians in the occupied territories to try to achieve peace. Most Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> reject this approach, insisting that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is their representative. The Israeli government contends they have been frightened into taking this position for fear of reprisal. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s statements sabotaged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s efforts to draw non-PLO Palestinians into the peace process `` If we say ahead of time that these partners are n't to be found, -LRB- if we say -RRB- let's move on to the radicals, then we are sabatoging attempts to find the moderates,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, `` This nation has decided not to commit suicide. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not allow the establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state because it is a danger to our existence. `` What do we have to talk about with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>? The weather? The Koran? The Torah?'' The reference was to the holy books of Islam and Judaism. Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was more accepting of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s idea. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has ideas, we will not censor them,'' he told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. `` We will not negotiate with an organization that engages in terror. But a nation? Yes, if the nation identifies with this organization, we can not censor their views.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two largest independent daily newspapers, <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday carried banner headlines portraying the Arens-Baker dispute as a major conflict over <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policies. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a Marxist faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday condemned meetings between Palestinians in the occupied territories and Israeli government officials. In the last few months a series of meetings have taken place between members of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s civil administration in the occupied territories and prominent Palestinians. `` Those -LRB- contacts -RRB- run by the civil administration only aim at creating tension and divisions in an attempt to ease the international anger against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s fascist ways at curbing the people's uprising'' against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. He said his organization supports talks between left-wing <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activists and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has revealed no details of the new peace plan he is expected to advance while in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He has hinted it will call for some kind of `` interim'' autonomy while a long-term solution is worked out for the occupied lands. This approach parallels the proposal in the U.S.-brokered 1978 Camp David peace accords with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and most Arab nations have rejected it as unworkable.

 A lone gunman killed Congressman <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> on the island province of <LOCATION> Masbate </LOCATION> on Friday shortly after he arrived by plane from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, congressional and military sources said. <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> was the first member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to be slain since President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took office in February 1986. Rep. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuenco </PERSON>, deputy speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> was killed moments after arriving in <LOCATION> Masbate </LOCATION> at 7:30 a.m. -LRB- 6:30 p.m. EST Thursday -RRB-. No arrests were reported. <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> ran as an independent but later joined the Struggle of the Democratic Filipino, which favors President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Milagros </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON>'s family as saying a single gunman shot the congressman with a semi-automatic rifle as he stepped onto the airport pavement. Earlier reports said up to five assailants attacked him. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reached the governor's office in <LOCATION> Masbate </LOCATION> by telephone, but the woman who answered said she had no details and the rest of the staff had rushed to the airport. Quoting relatives, Mrs. <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON> said <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> was accompanied by bodyguards but they were unable to fire because they had surrendered their weapons to the plane's crew before departing <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cuenco </PERSON> said five <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members would fly to <LOCATION> Masbate </LOCATION> later to investigate the killing. Military officials confirmed the death but said a full report would probably not be available until Saturday because of poor communications to <LOCATION> Masbate </LOCATION>, about 235 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON>, 55, was elected to the House from <LOCATION> Masbate </LOCATION> in May 1987. His brother, <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON>, is governor of the province and another brother, <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, is also a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. He was survived by his wife, <PERSON> Ludivina </PERSON>, three sons and three daughters. In an earlier incident, police in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> police reported Thursday that a soldier who was part of the contingent assigned to protect Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> went on a shooting spree and wounded two people before neighbors stabbed and beat him to death. A police report said <PERSON> Patrolman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramil </PERSON> <PERSON> Villafranca </PERSON> went on a shooting rampage late Wednesday in his neighborhood in the working-class district of <LOCATION> Tondo </LOCATION> and shot and wounded two people. Residents then pulled out knives and clubs, chased <LOCATION> Villafranca </LOCATION>, then beat and stabbed the soldier, the report said. <LOCATION> Villafranca </LOCATION>'s attackers fled before police arrived, it said The report did not say what triggered <LOCATION> Villafranca </LOCATION>'s rage.

 <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> seized five Japanese fishing boats Thursday in reprisal for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s closing of its market to Chilean fruit because of a cyanide scare. Also Thursday, President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said the amount of cyanide found in two Chilean grapes in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> `` would n't even kill a mouse'' and called <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warnings about Chilean fruit exaggerated. `` They tried to kill a fly with a tank,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> caution to consumers while he visited a fruit packing house. Then he ate several grapes. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> defended the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action but added, `` We are all trying to get Chilean products back on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market as fast as is humanly possible.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Captain <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON> was quoted by the official news agency <PERSON> Orbe </PERSON> as saying the five Japanese trawlers were held in the ports of <LOCATION> Talcahuano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chacabuco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arenas </ORGANIZATION>, in southern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Orbe </PERSON> also quoted <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON> as saying a sixth Japanese boat, in waters near <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, will be seized when it arrives at a Chilean port. Adm. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, navy commander-in-chief, told reporters: `` The Japanese have closed their market to Chilean fruits, so I'm holding their ships. `` None of them is going to fish in our waters until they re-open the market to our fruits,'' said <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, who is also president of the law-making <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junta </ORGANIZATION>. Late Thursday, naval sources said two of the seized Japanese vessels were docked for repairs. The sources said the vessels were registered in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> but operating leased by unidentified Japanese fishing companies. An anonymous caller on Thursday claimed a rocket would be fired at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. Police checked a nearby building but found nothing. They increased security around the embassy. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Monday urged consumers not to eat Chilean fruit after two grapes in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, in a shipment from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, were found to contain a small amount of cyanide. Many supermarkets pulled Chilean fruits from their shelves. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> followed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lead. The fruit was found after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese embassies in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> received anonymous phone calls saying that Chilean fruit would be poisoned. The Chilean government blamed leftist terrorists. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> made his remarks during a surprise visit to two fruit packing houses near <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, where a worker handed the president and army commander a cluster of seedless white grapes, saying: `` Mr. President, these are the grapes they claim are poisoned.'' `` They are very good,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> replied, as he ate several. Business and trade union organizations say thousands of workers have been fired as a result of the measure against the nation's booming fruit export industry The industry employs 500,000 workers and exports 65 percent of its products to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` What worries me most is you, the workers. I'm studying a compensation for you all,'' the president said. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> told workers he expects a solution to the problem `` probably within the next five days or so.'' The government said it increased security measures throughout the fruit export sector, including reinforcing controls in the fields, packing houses, in transportation and ports. Chileans have reacted angrily to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warnings. On Thursday, hundreds gathered before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> carrying sigs reading `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Chilean Fruits are OK,'' and `` <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> demands compensation.'' Trucks loaded with fruit were taken to the demonstration site, and free grapes and apples were distributed to the people. Many ate them, others took them home. Government officials and private businessmen have said the crisis will cost <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> up to $ 1 billion in lost fruit exports, which have become one of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s most successful economic items in recent years. Last year, fruit exports earned $ 581 million and had been expected to bring in $ 850 million this year.

 Communist rebels killed a police intelligence agent Wednesday in a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb, and the military said nine other people were slain in clashes between insurgents and government forces. Police said <PERSON> Patrolman </PERSON> <PERSON> Leandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> was in his jeep preparing to leave for work in suburban Navotas when five gunmen opened fire, killing him instantly. The assailants, who escaped, left a note signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Alex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boncayao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> saying <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> was slain because he was assigned to a police counterintelligence unit. The <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Boncayao </PERSON> <PERSON> Brigade </PERSON> is the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> wing of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has been waging a 20-year insurgency to establish a Communist state On <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island, 500 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, the military said three rebels and three soldiers were killed Monday in <LOCATION> Lanao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> province. Three more soldiers died in rebel ambushes the same day in the <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> provinces of <ORGANIZATION> Agusan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Surigao </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Norte </PERSON>, military reports said. In another development, the military said nine soldiers and four <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> civilians were fired for financial irregularities as part of a crackdown on corruption. Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said the 13 dismissed employees had finance jobs at the Armed Forces General Staff, the central <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visayas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and at the military hospital in <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said all were undergoing investigation to determine if they would be court-martialed for embezzlement or misappropriation of funds. The military command has come under increasing pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the public and the news media to eliminate corruption, which flourished in the 160,000-member army during the 20-year administration of President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was ousted in 1986. Also Wednesday, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters she had approved in principle a package of reforms and other measures her government will undertake as a condition for $ 1.3 billion in <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> loans. She said a `` letter of intent'' accepting the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> terms will be forwarded to Fund headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after a review by the Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Formal approval also will pave the way for $ 1.6 billion more in new loans from commercial banks and for talks with foreign creditors to reschedule up to $ 2 billion of the country's $ 28 billion foreign debt. In its letter of intent, the government pledges to reduce the budget deficit by improved tax collection, to liberalize imports regulations and to disband or sell off most of its state-owned businesses. It also agrees to continue a floating exchange rate which has seen the peso lose about three percent of its value against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar in the past year. Critics contend the government can not meet the terms of the package without raising prices for electric power, transport and food.

 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who searched a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> lawyer's office found further evidence linking him to the disappearance of a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> millionaire's wife, a prosecutor told a federal magistrate Wednesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> ordered the lawyer, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, held without bond and returned to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to stand trial on federal charges of extortion and perjury in the kidnapping of 73-year-old <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>, wife of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, businessman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>, disappeared on July 26, 1988, and has not been found although her husband complied with a ransom note. While <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> is not charged with the woman's kidnapping, he is charged with extortion for hiring a woman to mail a note from Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> to her husband urging him to comply with a ransom demand. He also faces charges of lying to a federal grand jury on Aug. 3, when he denied any knowledge of the disappearance, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON> said agents searched <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>'s combination home and law office and found a map of <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, with the location of the Hearins' home circled Also marked were the locations of businesses and a little-known farm owed by the Hearins'. The agents seized six aerial maps of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, an old Royal typewriter, a 9mm semi-automatic gun and a .38 - caliber The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that a Royal typewriter manufactured between 1912 and 1926 was used to type the ransom note for Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>. Investigators are conducting tests on the typewriter found at <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>'s home to see if it was used to type the ransom note, <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON> also said a neighbor of the Hearins identified <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> from a photo lineup as a man she had seen in a white van in the neighborhood a few days before the kidnapping. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> paid a woman friend $ 500 to fly to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and mail a letter written by the kidnap victim a couple weeks after the kidnapping. The letter urged <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> to meet the ransom demand. The day after receiving the note, <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> paid out almost $ 1 million to the 12 men listed in the ransom note, including <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, who returned the money. <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, 64, who served as his own attorney for the hearing, stood up near the end of the hearing and said, `` Much of this surprises me.'' <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> and the 11 others listed in the ransom note to <LOCATION> Hearin </LOCATION> were current or former franchise holders of <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in which <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> owned controlling interest. The corporation had sued all 12, claiming they owed the company money, and won a judgment against <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> of about $ 150,000. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s worth reportedly exceeds $ 100 million. He is co-owner of <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and co-owner of <ORGANIZATION> Yazoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a gardening equipment manufacturing company.

<TEXT>
 Eight days after completing an alchoholism rehabilitation program, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was back on the lecture circuit Wednesday, addressing college students on the lack of women in politics. The wife of the <LOCATION> Massachussets </LOCATION> governor and failed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> candidate, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, arrived at <ORGANIZATION> Villanova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> wearing a soft cast on her left ankle to protect ligaments torn in a fall earlier this week. She discussed her alchoholism with reporters before her speech. `` There's a word with my disease and that's called recovering,'' she said. `` I'll always be recovering and I hope I'll be able to follow the steps of the program. That will be a part of my life.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said she feels encouraged about her future and frequently described her outlook as `` positive.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was hospitalized in February for alchoholism rehabilitation at <LOCATION> Edgehill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, for 31 days. She has said her drinking began shortly after the November election, but as she did at a news conference shortly after her release last Tuesday, she refused Wednesday to blame the campaign for her drinking. In her speech, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said alcoholism or drug abuse knows no barriers of class, race or sex. `` Contemporary society still reserves a special stigma, a modern letter of scarlet, for women who become dependent on drugs, whether liquid or solid,'' she said. Women are accustomed to struggles, she said, as is seen in women's efforts to get ahead in politics. `` No area of political involvement is more important for women today than that of fund raising. Here, through networks of friends, associates and neighbors, we have a golden opportunity to make a significant impact all across the country,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said she has n't had a chance to form an opinion of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration because she was not allowed to watch television news or read newspapers during her treatment. In 1982 she overcame a 26-year addiction to diet pills. She said she is working on a book about the presidential campaign and will continue speaking around the country. Before being hospitalized for alchohol addiction, she had delivered three speeches on various topics in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.

 Convicted mass-murder <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> has been transferred from <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quentin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> to a new maximum security unit in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a prison official said Wednesday. Lt. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, one of the most notorious of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 78,000 convicts, was sent to <ORGANIZATION> Corcoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> this week to be housed in the state's toughest new maximum security unit. `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> is undergoing a major change in mission, from a maximum-security prison to a medium-security prison,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON>, a Corrections Department spokesman. <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> is among 957 high-risk inmates who have been transferred to the $ 253 million Corcoran prison since it opened 13 months ago. The prison's population on Wednesday was 3,576 inmates. Officials did not name any other well-known inmates now housed in the facility, roughly midway between <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and about 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, 52, has spent nearly all of his adult life in federal and state prisons. He had been on parole less than two years from the federal prison at <LOCATION> Terminal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> when his `` Manson Family'' cult followers murdered actress <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, coffee heiress <PERSON> Abigail </PERSON> <PERSON> Folger </PERSON>, Polish filmmaker <PERSON> Voityk </PERSON> <PERSON> Frykowski </PERSON> and six others in a month-long murder spree in 1969. <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> was convicted of masterminding and ordering the Tate and other murders in an effort to trigger a race war that he believed was foretold in the Beatles' song `` Helter Skelter.'' <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> is serving a life sentence for the Tate murders, but is technically eligible for consideration for parole, if the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terms </ORGANIZATION> considered him suitable for release. At his latest hearing 13 months ago, the board again turned down parole for three years _ the longest period allowed without additional review. Board member <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leddy </PERSON> at that time said it was `` highly unlikely'' that <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, who has been turned down seven times for parole, ever would be released.

 Nearly 30 years after independence, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> says it is time for <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> to atone for the years it held the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> country as the colony known as the Belgian <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> argues that <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> exploited his country before and after it gained independence in 1960. `` We were cheated by <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>,'' he said recently. `` Our good faith was abused. Now that we are equals, we want to put everything into question again.'' He insists that <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> has a moral duty to do more to help <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> out of its $ 7 billion foreign debt. He intends to raise the question at a top-level ministerial conference tentatively set for sometime this spring. For its part, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> says it is ready to discuss a rescheduling of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s debt but will not renegotiate the treaties it signed with <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> in 1965 or discuss the way it granted independence almost overnight in 1960. Belgian-Zairean relations have been punctuated by criticism here on grounds that <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s rule is authoritarian and disregards human rights, and by complaints in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> about Belgian shortcomings in helping its former colony. <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> contents that Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, on a visit in November, was hardly generous in helping to ease <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s foreign debt. Yet <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>' offer _ forgiving $ 25 million of the $ 125 million <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> owes <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> _ was large enough to renew criticism in the Belgian media and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> about the way <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> has run his nation since he seized power in a 1965 coup. An angry <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> said he would have broken relations with <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> had King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> not proposed to mediate. <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> insists the ministerial meeting this spring should touch on old colonial disputes. `` The investigation of the disputes will show exactly who owes what to whom,'' <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> said. He added that unless <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> agrees to discuss colonial times, he will go to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, also known as the World Court. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> claims <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> exploited his nation's mineral wealth before and after independence and keeping all the proceeds. Some here agree <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> owes <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> a moral debt but question <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s timing and motives for bringing the matter up now. `` <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> has a historical debt,'' said Economic Affairs Minister Minister <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Claes </PERSON>. `` -LRB- But -RRB- discovering these so-called truths 25 years late ... is not very credible.'' `` Politically, colonization was a debacle and largely linked to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s attitude,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Williame </PERSON> of the African Study and Documentation Center in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. `` But you can not convert the moral argument into money.'' King <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> gained personal control of the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> in 1885 and imposed a regime of forced labor. In his book `` Red Rubber, <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and his <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> specialist <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vangroenweghe </PERSON> wrote that the harshness of the regime and disease depleted half the colony's population in 40 years. <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> had earned a personal fortune and the scorn of world public opinion when the Belgian state took control of the territory from him in 1908. `` I will give them my <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> said at the time, `` but they have no right to know what I did there.'' Several Belgian companies made their fortunes in the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> in the past century, among them <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> which today is <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest holding company. Four Belgian companies _ all controlled by <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> _ now are drawing a net benefit from <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> of about $ 300 million a year, largely through mining and refining of Zairean copper, diamonds and cobalt. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s fourth largest creditor after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, known in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> as `` The Savior Guide,'' rejects charges that he is authoritarian with little regard for human rights and that he has enriched himself at the expense of his 34 million people. His response is that he saved <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> from political chaos, restored law and order and created a nation out of a kaleidoscope of ethnic tribes. `` If I think what the country owes me,'' he said, `` I get weak inside, and tears well in my eyes.'' His critics, however, point to his sizable real estate holdings across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, his palatial residence in his hometown of <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION> and a personal fortune said to run into billions of dollars.

<HEAD>Oscar Race for Best Actress Is a Tough Call</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Five members of a new generation of American film actress are in competition for the 61st Academy Award for best leading role, and the power of their performances makes the race one of the toughest Oscar calls in years. <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> has become an Academy Award regular, this year's `` A Cry in the Dark'' marking her eighth nomination. Two have resulted in Oscars: as supporting actress in `` <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> vs. Kramer'' -LRB- 1979 -RRB-, and best actress in `` Sophie's Choice'' -LRB- 1982 -RRB-. In `` A Cry in the Dark,'' the 39-year-old actress again portrayed a martyred woman, the real-life Australian housewife named <PERSON> Lindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, who spent three years in prison after being convicted of killing her infant daughter. She insisted the child had been carried off by a dingo, a wild Australian dog. She was finally exonerated last September. As in `` Sophie's Choice,'' `` Out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' and other films, Streep affected an accent. `` I get a lot of flak for my accents,'' she admitted in a recent magazine interview. She has no intention of changing her acting style because of the kidding, but adds: `` Once in a while I think it would be a relief to play a housewife trying to raise three kids, keep her husband and organize her neighbors to fight pesticides.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, the scheming marquise of `` Dangerous Liaisons,'' has a remarkable Oscar record of her own, having been nominated for five of her eight films. But so far, no wins. Close, 41, was named for supporting actress in `` The World According to Garp,'' `` The Big Chill'' and `` The Natural,'' and for a leading role in the terrifying `` Fatal Attraction'' last year. `` Since the beginning of time, we've been trying to figure out who we are in relation to the opposite sex, and then how to relate to them,'' she has said. `` Both ` Fatal Attraction' and ` Dangerous Liaisons' deal with that theme in different ways. When it comes to sexual identity, we're living in very unsettled times.'' For former child star <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, the Academy nomination for `` The Accused'' confirms her emergence as a mature actress. The recognition might help erase the notoriety caused by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinkley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s attempted assassination of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hinkley </PERSON> had attempted to impress <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, upon whom he had fixated after seeing her in `` Taxi Driver'' 14 times. Her role as the prostitute in `` Taxi Driver'' won her a nomination as supporting actress at the age of 13. Now 26, she was nominated as the brassy waitress who is gang-raped in the backroom of a tavern. Of `` The Accused'' role, she comments: `` I like her. I think the audience likes her. There are probably moments when they do n't like her, but she's human. She has flaws, she says the wrong things, she can be loud, and she repeats herself. `` She's somebody you can know, which makes the issue of ... what rape is all about. It becomes even more cruel when it happens to someone you know.'' <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, 39, finds herself in the peculiar position of being nominated as lead actress for `` Gorillas in the Mist,'' and for support in `` Working Girl.'' It last happened to <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> in 1982, who was nominated as best actress in `` Frances'' -LRB- she lost to Streep in `` Sophie's Choice'' -RRB-, and won for supporting actress in `` Tootsie.'' As the late naturalist <PERSON> Dian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fossey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> did what most other stars would never consider: she worked intimately with wild gorillas. She discounts the danger involved: `` I was reading a lot of <PERSON> Dian </PERSON>'s papers and rereading her book, and it seemed that she was often threatened by gorillas, but they never actually hurt her. It was all a question of getting to know each other. `` I did n't see why they would feel animosity toward me. That was a lucky choice on my part. I do n't think it would have been wise to go in and work with animals without having previously reassured yourself that you would be all right.'' <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> has been in the news with her re-engagement to <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of TV's `` Miami Vice.'' They were divorced 12 years ago and are expecting a child. The Oscar could bring added joy to the 31-year-old daughter of actress Tippi Hedren, who starred in <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s `` The Birds.'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> is nominated as the wily, ambitious <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> McGill </PERSON>, who rises swiftly from the secretarial pool to corporate boardrooms in `` Working Girl.'' `` <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> correlated a lot with me and my career,'' the actress remarked in a recent article. `` Like saying, ` OK, I'm going to do this part because I know I can. That's what <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> did, and I feel that's what I've done _ against everybody saying, ` Oh you're just a sexpot or a nymphet.' Or, ` You're a problem, you drink too much, you do drugs.' Or ` You're wild.''' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> had a wild youth and appeared nude in early films -LRB- also seminude while vacuuming in `` Working Girl'' -RRB-. But the movie world took her more seriously after her kooky <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON> in the 1986 `` Something Wild.''

 Fifty years after his appointment to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and nine years after his death, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> remains a source of strong emotions in the state that shaped his life and his opinions. A critical documentary is scheduled to air next month, a major symposium on <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' career is planned in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, newly released government files reveal an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> scheme to discredit him, and the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> is considering the $ 100,000 purchase of his <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> hideaway for a public memorial. `` He is a compelling figure,'' said <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, whose documentary is to air on public television stations. `` The strength of his personality, the magnitude of his work. He was a person who saw a chance to do good and he did it.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> was raised in poverty in <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION>, then taught high school here for two years before deciding in 1922 to become a lawyer. After serving as a law professor, lawyer, and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, he was nominated to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on March 20, 1939, by President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. During 36 years on the high court, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> wrote a record 1,200 decision. He was a consistent supporter of abortion rights, First Amendment press protections, the environment, and the rights of criminal suspects, including the controversial Miranda decision. He used his position to oppose racism in schools and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> surveillance of Vietnam War protesters. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> recently overturned some affirmative action programs and will hear arguments on a case that could affect its landmark ruling legalizing abortion, so <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' views remain important, said H.G. <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, organizer of the three-day <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> symposium scheduled to begin April 15. It will look at him as environmentalist, internationalist, civil libertarian and as a man. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s documentary, funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> and produced by <ORGANIZATION> KYVE </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, is scheduled to air in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> on April 17, the anniversary of <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' elevation to the court. It paints an unflattering portrait of <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' domineering mother and includes a scathing attack by his daughter, a discussion of his four marriages and his extramarital affairs, and interviews with former clerks who remember a driving perfectionist with little regard for their personal lives. What emerges is a picture of an egotistical, often unpleasant man, deeply scarred by early poverty, who rose primarily through his brilliance. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' daughter, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON>, remembers a distant father with little time or use for his children. `` He did n't want to be talked to at breakfast because he was reading the paper. He did n't know what to do with us.'' His first clerk, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, lawyer, recalled a stern boss: `` There was never a thought that I was overburdened.'' Ms. <PERSON> Read </PERSON> said her father had many affairs, moving on as he grew tired of each woman. <PERSON> Mercedes </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichholz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' second wife, whose lengthy affair with the justice broke up his first marriage after 29 years, said, `` His pursuit was so hot and heavy he wore me down.'' The <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> Oregonian reported in January that secret <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files showed a pattern of misdeeds against <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> covering two decades and including former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s attempt to impeach him in 1970. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> first began keeping tabs on him in the early 1950s, when former Gov. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Langlie </PERSON> wrote to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brownell </PERSON> that communists were regular guests at <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' summer home in La Push More than three decades later, state officials are once again concerned with one of <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' summer homes _ but this time they wish to honor the native son. A bill has been introduced in the House that seeks to purchase the alpine cabin that <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> built in 1965 near <LOCATION> Goose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION>, about 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rainier </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> report issued last Tuesday noted that turning the cabin site into a wilderness studies institute would be appropriate. `` Using the property would encourage an understanding of wilderness principles,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotell </PERSON> of the forest service. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, the jurist's fourth wife, put the home up for sale last year. If it becomes a public memorial, she has agreed to return many of the furnishings and memorabilia to the chalet-style dwelling.

 This gray <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> prairie has been home to coal and crops, but it was something alien in the soil that gave rise to 10 years of litigation and a legacy that could linger for centuries. Deep in the earth among tons of waste in a long-closed dump, a radioactive substance called tritium is leaking from dirt trenches in which it was buried. Though experts say this form of hydrogen from nuclear power plants, factories and research labs is n't enough to pose any danger, the leak illustrates the potential risks of such dumps. `` Nobody knows how to safely bury hazardous waste for the length of time the waste will be hazardous,'' argues <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, a government whistleblower who now works at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's all supposition and prayer.'' Others say the industry has come a long way since the late 1960s, when the low-level nuclear waste dump opened in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>. Still, scientists concede that while tests to determine the suitability of the <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> area were considered sufficient then, they'd be terribly inadequate by current standards. `` In the mid -'60s, not much was known about the regulation of low-level waste disposal,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>, senior nuclear scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> `` We've learned an awful lot in 20 years. We've learned before you OK a site ... you should do a very thorough investigation. We've learned it after the fact in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>.'' `` By today's standards, that site should n't or would n't be used,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>, noting the soil is too sandy and gravelly, allowing water to move distances in six months that experts originally thought would take hundreds of years. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> says the dump has a mixed record. `` It did n't contain the radioactivity as predicted,'' he said. `` But it continues to isolate the radioactivity from people.'' That does n't satisfy local activist <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who heads a citizens group that has opposed the dump as well as an adjacent one filled with non-nuclear hazardous waste that is also leaking. `` It has to be one of the biggest blights in this country,'' he said. Even those who believe the operators were conscientious say it does n't do a community any good to be near two leaking dumps. `` It's definitely been a deficit to us,'' said businessman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprowls </PERSON>, adding, `` Like anybody else, I do n't know what's out there. ... I'm not smart enough to know what the real danger is.'' The 20-acre dump, located about 3 -LCB- miles from this west-central town of 1,100, is in a former strip mining area now dotted with farms. It holds about 3.3 million cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste, including contaminated tools and clothes from hospitals and nuclear power plants, 100 pounds of plutonium and uranium and parts of a dismantled nuclear reactor _ all buried in 22 trenches. The dump was closed in 1978 when the state refused to allow the operators, then <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, to bury waste in a new trench. The state said tritium, which also is used in most modern bombs, was leaking and the ground was too sandy. Nuclear Engineering decided to leave. The company `` put the keys to the gate on the table in one of the sheds and sent us a telegram saying, ` We have finished our work at the site. Since you own it, it's yours again,''' said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, a private attorney who represented the state. The state filed a $ 97 million lawsuit, charged the company had broken its 99-year lease. A judge ordered the company, which in 1981 became <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to remain there until trial. A decade later, an out-of-court settlement was reached. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Ecology will commit more than $ 8 million to test, monitor and maintain the area, remain there until 1998 and build a new 4 -LCB- - foot-thick clay cover over the dump State officials insist the agreement is fair. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> disagrees. `` We think our community was sold out not having any input in that settlement,'' he said. `` Eight million dollars and they're able to walk away in 10 years. ... We think $ 8 million is peanuts to take care of that site.'' As part of the 1988 agreement, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Ecology also purchased a 170-acre buffer zone and built a fence around it after it was discovered tritium had moved beyond the dump into nearby groundwater and a lake. That angers <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. The state's `` Band-Aid has been to allow them to buy more property where it's leaking,'' he said. `` We ca n't say there's devalued land next to it because they bought the land ... It can move to the end of town and they can continue to buy the land. Can they buy the town eventually?'' But <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> says the land has been thoroughly studied and experts feel the leak can be contained within the buffer zone until the radioactivity decays. Most, he said, will be gone within 100 years. Ed also said the highest levels of tritium, which leaked because earthen covers did n't prevent rain from seeping into the radioactive material, amount to only 10 percent of the maximum the government allows to be released to unrestricted areas. `` The levels we're talking about you ca n't build bombs,'' he explained, noting the same was true of the plutonium, which is thoroughly dispersed. However, the plutonium and uranium will remain hundreds of years, and though it's unlikely they'll move, people must be prevented from digging into the waste. `` The site has to be monitored and maintained for a hundred years at least,'' he said. Though one legal battle is over, a 9-year-old lawsuit is pending over <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION>'s 45-acre non-nuclear hazardous waste site. Chemicals are leaking from the 4.3 million cubic feet of waste, and some of the chemicals have apparently mixed with the tritium. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Ecology also is spending more than $ 1.3 million to study the scope of that problem and seek remedies. Meanwhile, the company started holding community forums last year to keep the town informed of its work. `` The site is a mystery to a lot of people,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Cade </PERSON>, the site's post operations manager. `` The word radioactive puts everybody on guard. ... By being more open than we had in the past, it would give them an opportunity for a better understanding of what goes on out there.'' `` They're trying to communicate more than they used to,'' confirmed Mayor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. ... -LRB- Before -RRB- they did things they did n't tell us about ... The public relations is better now.''

 `` Live-In'' star <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> is <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s great young hope to become a teen TV heartthrob like <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> of `` The <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> Family'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> on `` Growing Pains.'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, in need of younger viewers, has two new family sitcoms premiering Monday that are designed to lure them. `` Live-In'' just might entice teen-agers, if CBS can get them to tune in to begin with. The network has n't fared well in the half-hour comedy area, and its kid-appeal, high-school drama `` TV 101'' has been passed over in the ratings. The new shows will move into the time periods vacated by `` Newhart'' and `` Kate & amp; <PERSON> Allie </PERSON>,'' which move to later in the night, replacing `` Almost Grown,'' which is on hold. `` Live-In'' has two appealing young stars -LRB- Young and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> -RRB-, a likable sitcom family, sprightly writing and enough daring to avoid yawn inducement in teens long jaded by sexually exploitative films. It airs opposite <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s kid-appeal hit `` ALF.'' Preceding `` Live-In'' is `` Heartland,'' a farm family sitcom that's kind of a `` Little ` Roseanne' on the Prairie.'' It's opposite `` The <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> Family.'' CBS is hoping <PERSON> Young </PERSON> will have the same teen appeal as <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>. He plays <PERSON> Danny </PERSON>, a typically girl-crazy kid who ca n't believe his luck when his parents hire a charming <LOCATION> Australian </LOCATION> au pair girl, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> -RRB-, to care for their infant daughter <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> trots around in crop tops and miniskirts, but expertly fends off the advances of <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> and his obnoxious friend, Gator -LRB- <PERSON> Lightfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> -RRB-, who shows up the morning after she has moved in and sensitively queries <PERSON> Danny </PERSON>, `` So, d'ya boff her yet?'' To placate those who are n't enchanted by simple-minded sex jokes, good sense ultimately triumphs over the kids' rampant lust. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON> plays good-natured dad, proprietor of a sporting goods store. <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farr </PERSON> is Supermom, filled with angst at returning to work and leaving her baby in the hands of a stranger. `` I'm all set,'' she declares. `` I've got my briefcase, my Wall Street Journal, my breast pump.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Moscow </PERSON> is the suitably baffled younger brother. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prudence </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> created the series and wrote the pilot, one of the better ones of the season. `` Heartland'' stars <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> as curmudgeonly B.L. <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON>, who lost his farm to the bankers and had to move in with his daughter, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Layman </PERSON> -RRB-, her farmer husband <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliland </PERSON> -RRB- and their three kids. Teen-aged <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristopher </PERSON> -RRB- dreams of living an urban existence in glittery <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>, while his brother <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Devin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratray </PERSON> -RRB- rhapsodizes about his pet pig. Daisy Keith plays their adopted Vietnamese daughter, but she does n't have a lot to do in the pilot. Not unlike blue-collar family in `` Roseanne,'' they struggle against financial realities with humor. The pilot relies too much on one-liners, but there's something endearing about a comedy that even dares to occasionally mention God. In the pilot, the family has to bring in the wheat crop without their broken-down combine before a fierce storm blows in. They do and it does, bringing with it a tornado. When they emerge from the basement to see if their home is standing, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> declares, `` It's still here, but there's a dead witch under the house and everything's in color! B.L. is supposed to be a kind of <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> of the Plains, but he's too sweet to take seriously. B.L. and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> carp at each other, but beneath it all have a begrudging mutual respect. There's a nice moment When <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> tries to tell B.L. he appreciates the way B.L. stood up to the smarmy finance man who's trying to buy <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s farm. Good-hearted `` Heartland'' is produced by <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Reo </PERSON>, who is also the writer.

According to <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, 84 percent of VCR households have incomes of over $ 40,000 a year, 73 percent have members with four years of college, 76 percent have more than four members of the family, and 74 percent have kids between the ages of 6 and 17.

 Critics say the Academy Awards telecast is showing its age. Producer <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> says that's the way it should be. In an attempt to keep the program's ratings from slipping, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> will celebrate Oscar by reveling in its yesteryears. `` I'm restoring it, hopefully, to what it was in its glorious day,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said of the March 29 broadcast of the 61st Annual Academy Awards from the Shrine Auditorium in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The program will be shown at 9 p.m. EST by <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> and scenic designer <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Clausen </PERSON> will recreate a likeness of the Cocoanut Grove, the tropical nightclub where the Oscar dinner banquet was held in 1940. Famous movie couples will be seated at tables between the palm trees, and a bandstand will be on the stage. `` This is the ultimate variety show,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. `` It's also the ultimate awards show that all the other awards show copy. So I have to make this a return to Oscar _ the way it was in the old days _ because now you have the Tonys, the <PERSON> Grammys </PERSON>, the American Music Awards, the People's Choice Awards. ... There's an awards show on every other week. `` The Oscars are supposed to be really glamorous and fun. It's the highest awards we give our royalty in this country I'm going to shock people with glamour and humor.'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> comes from a career filled with flamboyant spectacles. As the producer of the stage hit `` La Cage aux folles'' and the movies `` Grease,'' `` Ca n't Stop the Music'' and `` Where the Boys Are'84,'' his projects have rarely strayed from playfulness and overblown kitsch. He even held a black-tie dinner party in 1976 at the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> jail in a rundown section of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, to celebrate the opening of `` Murder by Death,'' which starred the late author <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Capote </PERSON>. `` Whether people like me or do n't like me, or they like what I do or do n't like what I do, they know that I love <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and I'm a big enthusiast for <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. `` For the last four years, the orchestra has not been in the auditorium; they were at an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> studio five miles away and the music was piped in. But this is going to be a Broadway show. I insisted that the orchestra comes back, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlisch </PERSON> will be in the pit conducting, and ramps have been put over the orchestra pit so the people can run up the aisles. `` I am producing, really, two things: A live show for the people who are there _ like a <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> opening night _ and a television show which has a feeling of a Broadway opening night for the people at home.'' There will be no single program host this year. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> will present the first statuette, <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> will present the last, and dozens of other stars will manage everything in between. Off-screen couples will be paired on-screen: <PERSON> Farrah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawcett </PERSON> will appear with <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>; <PERSON> Goldie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawn </PERSON> will be with <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Demi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> will be escorted by her husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>. `` It's like ` Chariots of Fire.' It's like a relay race,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. `` The presenters pass the torch to the next person.'' The telecast will honor awards presenters as well as winners. When <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> appear to hand out a trophy, the audience will be shown a clip from their work together in 1958's `` Vertigo.'' The awards show will be held on Wednesday this year, unlike the traditional Monday. The move is a result of both the preceding Easter holiday and a possible television technicians strike the following week. The show, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said, will be seen in 164 countries, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the first time. `` When it was announced that I was going to produce the show, people said, ` You've got to have more of the entrances and the arrivals. That's what people love to see.' ... The Oscars are about entrances. And so you will see great stars, through five generations of different age groups, making the entrances down these incredible staircases.'' One production number will focus on up-and-coming stars, and there will be a retrospective of film musicals. `` I wanted to bring my love of the musical movie to the Oscars,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. `` Through lots of research, I realized that more movie stars made musicals in the'50s than any other decade. So I have put together this homage to the stars of the'50s musical, and you will see people like <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Grable </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> ... but also <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanza </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ava </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayworth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lana </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said complaints about past Oscar shows running past their allotted three hours miss the real point. `` You only realize how long it is if you're bored,'' he said. `` My answer is: You did n't ask how long ` <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hur </PERSON>' was. Now that ` Lawrence of Arabia' is out again _ it's almost four hours long _ no one complains. If you're entertained, you do n't watch the clock.'' To keep the pace brisk, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> winners with multiple trophy recipients _ as is common in technical awards _ will have one designated speaker. After 30 seconds of thank yous, the microphone will go dead and the camera will go to the next podium. Said <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>: `` They can talk as long as they want, but no one's going to hear it.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> wants to substitute five words in the state civil code with two words that supporters say would undo years of anti-gay discrimination and opponents say would undermine society's structure. The change <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> wrote in a proposed code revision, unanimously endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> directors, would define marriage as a `` personal relation arising out of a civil contract between two people.'' Under the law now, it's between `` a man and a woman.'' The change would have let <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkin </PERSON> take a three-day leave after the death of his lover of 11 years. His employer would n't let him off, though a co-worker got time off for the death of a stepmother he had never met. It would have made it easier for <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchens </PERSON> and her partner to adopt. <PERSON> Hitchens </PERSON>, an attorney, had to become the child's guardian, leaving her partner with no legal parental authority until they successfully challenged the law; ultimately, they legally adopted two children. It also would force hospitals to allow a gay AIDS patient's lover into intensive care. Many only let in relatives. Gay couples live in a `` limbo-like state outside of the law,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>, president of the local association. `` It's a pariah-type class that's set up within the law. To me, it's an unfairness issue.'' Redefining marriage to include homosexuals would grant all the rights, privileges _ and burdens _ of marriage to gay couples. Among the areas affected if the proposal is made into law are tax exemptions, inheritance laws, pensions and health plans, as well as parenting privileges and adoption rights. `` We're not for it,'' said <PERSON> Deacon </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, spokesman for Catholic Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. `` To us, marriage is a sacrament with deeply religious overtones. Our church believes marriage can only be entered into by a male and a female.'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> believes some inequities may warrant compensation, but calls for use of contracts `` that do n't establish a quasi-marriage.'' The resolution must survive two local reviews to be considered by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> in September, when about 500 representatives of the state's 117,000 lawyers will consider and propose new laws and and plan repeal efforts. If it passes, Bar lobbyists will seek a legislative sponsor. The specification of `` a man and a woman'' became law in 1977 after a spate of gay marriages, which were n't prohibited then. Under the amendment signed by Gov. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, homosexuals have little say regarding partners' medical care and can not share insurance coverage or health benefits. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city governed by a majority of gay city officials, unmarried city employees may add their partners to health benefit and pension plans. <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> offer similar benefits. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where an estimated 10 percent of residents are gay, <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, the panel's only gay member, has spent years trying to provide sweeping rights to `` alternative families.'' <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON>, who is not gay, said her proposal also would include child custody, community property and spousal support obligations. Supporters do n't anticipate throngs of gay couples flocking to the altar, but they insist that everyone should have the opportunity _ and equal rights. Auto insurance companies that offer family reductions exclude homosexuals and unmarried heterosexual couples, and income tax laws favor married couples in some ways, according to <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> of the Lesbian Rights Project. `` So long as benefits are given or taken away based on relationship status, then we want access to them as well,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, an attorney with National Gay Rights Advocates. Like many lesbians, <PERSON> Hitchens </PERSON> says she would marry if she could. After 12 years with her partner and two adopted children, she said economics _ not emotion _ would prompt her to tie the legal knot. <PERSON> Brinkin </PERSON>, who lost a court battle against his employer over bereavement leave for the death of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, is n't sure whether he would marry. `` My commitment comes from my heart and I do n't need a piece of paper to do that.'' Advocates of the change say the issue is purely a question of law, that the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution prohibits discrimination against classes of people and should cover homosexuals. `` My guess is that the debate is going to be much more sociological than legal,'' said <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wied </PERSON>, president of the State Bar. `` Society would recoil at this idea. My guess is that lawyers will follow suit.''

<HEAD>Court To Decide If Surviving Gay Lover Should Be Evicted</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> were regarded by friends as a loving couple, their <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment the home of `` any happily married couple.'' But <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> faces eviction because their landlord disagrees. When <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> died in <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>'s arms in 1986, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s name was on the lease to the rent-controlled apartment the two men had shared for a decade. Leases pass from parent to child or spouse to spouse under the rent control laws in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s tight and pricy real estate market. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> says that as a `` family member'' he should have succession rights even though his name was n't on the lease. The landlord, <ORGANIZATION> Stahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, maintains <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> had no right to the desirable apartment because he was not a member of <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s `` traditional family unit ... those related by blood, marriage or adoption.'' According to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, a gay rights group, `` The case is about individuals who live in families that vary from the <PERSON> Ozzie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> mold.'' State court Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Baer </PERSON> ruled that the men were a family under the rent-control law because of `` the time, love and commitment given by <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> to <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Baer </PERSON> halted the eviction, but was overturned on appeal. The Court of Appeals, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s highest court, will hear arguments April 26. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> is allowed to stay in the apartment while the case is in court. `` It's not just a question for gay people,'' <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said. `` It's an issue about the right of each individual to enter into a non-traditional, non-orthodox relationship and be protected by the law.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> must decide whether people in non-traditional living arrangements _ homosexuals, unmarried heterosexuals, even elderly couples _ have the same protection as married couples and blood relatives. The court ruled in 1984 that one member of a homosexual couple could n't adopt the other to keep from being evicted from an apartment that only allowed family members to live together. `` This is the most important case in the country dealing with non-traditional family arrangements,'' said <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>. The court's decision could affect insurance, hospital visiting rights, inheritance and other areas in which the definition of `` family'' is crucial <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> had hired <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> to manage his exclusive <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> beauty salon and made him sole beneficiary, leaving him $ 5 million. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> exchanged bracelets in 1977 as a symbol of their commitment. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>, 33, now wears both. He cared for <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> during the final months of his life and was holding <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> in his arms when he died in September 1986. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>, 33, says he and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> `` regarded one another ... as spouses.'' `` Their friends regarded them as a ` married couple' and their apartment as ` the home of any happily married couple,''' according to court papers. <ORGANIZATION> Stahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> has argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> never extended succession rights to `` members of a non-traditional family unit,'' and has accused <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> of trying to turn the case into a `` referendum on homosexual rights.'' <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>'s lawyers say <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> is trying to create that impression `` to prejudice the atmosphere,'' and that the case is simply about family rights. `` What this case is about is people's relationships, whether they will be protected, based on the strength of the relationship,'' said <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>. `` It -LRB- speaks -RRB- in terms of family relationships. Family would be not just spouses. You're protected under this law if it's your uncle.''

<HEAD>Best Picture Nominees Offer Wide Range of Place and Theme</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 From 18th-century <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to the backroads of 1960s <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to today's corporate <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, the Academy Award nominees for best picture of 1988 offer a wide range of place and theme. But the front-runner seems to be `` Rain Man,'' the saga of an autistic savant kidnapped by his cold-hearted brother, which has already won the Directors Guild award for its director, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>. `` Rain Man'' had its problems before production. <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> was intrigued with playing a retarded man, gifted with a genius for numbers. The role of the autistic man's brother, a scheming salesman, was closer to <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s age, but the actor heeded his agent's advice after <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON>'s `` Ishtar'' disaster: Do n't put two middle-aged actors on the screen. <PERSON> Hearthrob </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> jumped at the chance to act with <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. Directors <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brest </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> undertook `` Rain Man'' in succession; all three withdrew for various reasons. The project soon began to look like one of those dream movies that never get made. Then <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> met <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> -LRB- `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' -RRB- at a performance of the Cirque de Soleil in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> directed `` Rain Man'' under schedule and $ 2.5 million under the $ 24 million budget -LRB- including an estimated $ 5 million apiece for the stars -RRB- The film has grossed $ 126.1 million. `` Dangerous Liaisons'' is another film with an unsettled history. The source material, <PERSON> Choderlos </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Laclos </PERSON>' 1782 novel about sexual intrigue among French aristocrats, long had been overlooked by a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> that disfavored costume dramas. `` Do n't give me any pictures where they write with feathers,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> is reported to have once said. When `` Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' became a hit play in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> bought the rights and hired the playwright <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> to write the script. The movie was filmed in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s fortunes were flagging. Also, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> was shooting another version of <PERSON> Laclos </PERSON>' work. After British director <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Frears </PERSON> had made `` Dangerous Liaisons'' -LRB- the title anglicized for Americans -RRB-, <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> sold out to <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros </ORGANIZATION>. Despite fears the movie would be ditched, <ORGANIZATION> Warners </ORGANIZATION> has given it a decent and slow release, hoping for word-of-mouth support. The gross after 11 weeks: $ 21.2 million. The most controversial of the film nominees is `` Mississippi Burning,'' a fictionalized account of the investigation of the 1964 murder of three civil rights worker in <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Miss. The <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerolmo </PERSON> script, directed by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, tells the story through the eyes of two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigators, played by <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>. `` Mississippi Burning'' was attacked by those who participated and reported the 1964 Freedom Summer. Said author <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Halberstam </PERSON>, who covered the story for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times: `` <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> has taken a terribly moving and haunting story and he has betrayed it, turned it into a Martin-and-Lewis slapstick between two cops. It's a bad movie: ` Mississippi False.''' `` It was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did not show one black role model that today's youth who look at the movie could remember,'' said <PERSON> Myrlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, whose activist husband, <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, was murdered by white segregationists outside his <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> home in 1963. <PERSON> Gerolmo </PERSON>, not an Oscar nominee, replied: `` I never understood this to be <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s ` civil rights' picture. It's an exciting story about something important. You see our moral failures and greatness. It allows us to see <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at its very worst and also to see people who displayed great moral courage.'' `` Mississippi Burning'' -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> code for the case -RRB- drew mixed reviews, several awards and only fair business -LRB- $ 28.8 million in 13 weeks -RRB-. `` The Accidental Tourist'' marks the third collaboration between actor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> and director <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasdan </PERSON>; they also worked together on `` Body Heat'' and `` The Big Chill.'' In the new film Hurt plays a travel writer who writes books for people who hate to travel. His private life is torn between his estranged wife -LRB- <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> -RRB- and an uninhibited dog trainer -LRB- <PERSON> Geena </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> -RRB-. While reviews were generally excellent, some criticized the passivity of Hurt's character. `` What's wrong with the heroism of a man who has traveled two inches?'' Hurt replies. `` That two inches is very profound.'' `` The Accidental Tourist'' has had a fairly good response at the box office: $ 28.8 million in 11 weeks. But receipts have dropped off in recent weeks. `` Working Girl'' gives top billing to <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, but they are virtually supporting players to third-billed <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>. She plays the central figure of <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> McGill </PERSON>, a shrewd, ambitious secretary who uses tricks worthy of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to climb to the top of the corporate ladder. The script bounced around 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> until it reached <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, who agreed to direct. `` One of the hardest things for a director to find in the'80s is a good story,'' he says. `` Every actress in town wanted this part,'' says <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>. `` You should see the script. I'm on every page.'' Because <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> insisted on the little-known <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> -LRB- `` you can see right into her feelings,'' he said -RRB-, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> paid big salaries to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> to assure star value. Though some critics twitted `` Working Girl'' as a fairy tale, most were favorable. Audiences agreed. The gross so far: $ 54.2 million in 11 weeks.

 With the snow melting on peaks around the <LOCATION> Rogue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, it's time for a return to the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Shakespeare Festival, where the 1989 season has opened with four plays examining personal conflict. Although it will be another three months before the festival opens its outdoor Elizabethan stage, the two indoor theaters are presenting <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s `` All My Sons,'' <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostand </PERSON>'s `` Cyrano de Bergerac,'' C.P <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s `` And a Nightingale Sang ...'' and <PERSON> Januscz </PERSON> <PERSON> Glowacki </PERSON>'s `` Hunting Cockroaches.'' `` All My Sons,'' `` Cyrano'' and `` Nightingale'' are standout productions with sparkling individual efforts, strong ensemble work and innovative sets that sustain the festival's high standards. The most impressive must be `` Cyrano.'' It's got tender love scenes and flashy swordplay, lightning wit and grisly battles. But most of all, it's got <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Woronicz </PERSON> in the title role, who gives a daring, dangerous Cyrano, whose sensitive side reveals a broken-hearted poet. At one instant, he is the <PERSON> Gascon </PERSON> warrior with `` panache.'' In another, he is a timid little boy who is ashamed of his overgrown nose. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Barricelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Morain </PERSON> give a delicious warmth to the roles of the lovers Christian and <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphey </PERSON> brings the villainous <PERSON> Count </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiche </PERSON> to the very brink of darkness without sacrificing anything in credibility. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmondson </PERSON>'s direction is right on mark, whether the moment calls for a kiss or a killing. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloodgood </PERSON>'s set, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON>'s costumes and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>'s lighting all add to the success of this classic. In `` All My Sons,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> examines the need for ethics over greed by examining two families in crisis following the end of World War II. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, played powerfully by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON>, owns a plant that turned out some defective airplane engine parts that eventually killed 21 American pilots. He and his foreman both were sent to prison for passing the defective parts along, but <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> got out on appeal and has attempted to return to a normal life. A complicating factor is that <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s son, who was reported missing in action, had planned to marry his foreman's daughter until the scandal broke. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s remaining son, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, is planning to marry the same girl, and the flowering of their relationship has reopened wounds. <PERSON> Cristine </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurdo-Wallis </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s emotionally scarred wife, who refuses to accept her elder son's death; <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Morain </PERSON> brings an understated style to the pivotal role of the girlfriend; and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphey </PERSON> runs the range from utter joy to unbearable anguish as <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> directs. The beautiful set _ the backyard of the all-American home _ is the work of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloodgood </PERSON>. World War II is also the basis for action in `` And a Nightingale Sang ...'' This time the scene is <LOCATION> Newcastle-on-Tyne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where German bombs drop outside while the <PERSON> Stott </PERSON> family deals with emotional bombs of their own inside. The story centers around <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, a pleasant but plain woman in her late 20s who has a slight limp. Much to her surprise, she finds love in the arms of a soldier. Then she discovers he involved with someone else. This rather mundane plot is spiced by the antics of <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>'s parents, grandfather and sister _ a strange lot to say the least. Through the chaos of war and an unsteady home life, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> holds herself steady and eventually overcomes her setbacks to emerge a stronger person. <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON>'s performance as <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> is one of the jewels at <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> this season, and the audience is clearly won over by her spirit. But high marks are also in order for all the others in this talented cast: <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> as her ditty-loving communist dad, <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Maaske </PERSON> as the devoutly Catholic mother, <PERSON> Deena </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> as the ditsy sister, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> as her spunky grandfather, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Geisslinger </PERSON> as her brother-in-law and <PERSON> Remi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandri </PERSON> as the soldier in her life. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shook </ORGANIZATION> directs this touching play, which takes place in an English home with the wonderfully workable set designed by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON>. The fourth offering at <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, `` Hunting Cockroaches,'' is also the only one staged inside the tiny Black Swan Theatre. It centers on two Polish immigrants as they attempt to adjust to life in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as represented by their cockroach-infested apartment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Janek </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Robynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisell-Frank </PERSON>, face problems in the new world. Her accent keeps her from finding an acting job; he's a struggling playwright. But they also face a variety of nightmarish `` roaches'' that crawl out from under the bed. These include a bag lady, a censor, an immigration officer and Polish secret police agents _ played in turn by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, <PERSON> JoAnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Buzz </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> is the director. The cast, particularly <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, deserve praise for their efforts. But the play never really works and tends to drag.

 On a recent stroll around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> was greeted by shouts of appreciation from passersby. For <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, a Broadway star whose performance in `` Song and Dance'' earned her a <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, it's her part of town. But cross over to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> and head down about 60 blocks and the bright lights give way to the lofts and underground art galleries of SoHo. It's a world depicted in <PERSON> Tama </PERSON> <PERSON> Janowitz </PERSON>'s collection of stories, `` Slaves of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' a new movie in which <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> stars It's also a world that the actress, a native of Ozone Park in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, knew little about. `` It was a unique experience doing the film,'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` There were lots of areas I had never gone to before _ the burned - out buildings, Avenue C and D with people living in burned-out cars I never realized how much of that there was.'' `` Slaves of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' was developed by the producer-director team of <ORGANIZATION> Ismail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivory </PERSON>, whose long list of credits include `` A Room With a View'' and `` Maurice.'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON>, a copyreader at an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> newspaper who lives with her boyfriend, Stash, a manipulative and highstrung artist. Dressed in layers of colorful clothing and designing outrageous hats, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> seems to share the same offbeat outlook as her bohemian friends, yet feels inferior. `` She does n't appreciate herself,'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said. `` She does n't realize what she's capable of Everyone else is concerned with what will sell, but <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> just makes hats because she enjoys it.'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> recently turned 41, but her soft features, squeaky voice and long, curly, blond hair make her appear much younger. She has been in show business since age 5 when she was a regular on television's `` Horn and Hardart Children's Hour.'' But she was a fan as well. <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> recalled seeing the film version of `` Auntie Mame,'' with <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> reprising her star stage role. `` My girlfriends rang the bell and I said OK, and asked my mother if I could go. I realized that when I got home how much I loved the movie. What I love right now is that with each film I'm learning more about being in front of the camera. It's about making that moment immediate. I love that.'' Movies were even more important to <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> than the newest craze of the 1950s: rock' n' roll. `` I used to come from school and there was a four o'clock movie on. I grew up on them and watched them after school instead of ` American Bandstand.''' She was 9 years old when she joined <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> and 13 when she had her first major stage role as Baby June in `` Gypsy.'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> limited her performing during high school, concentrating on her studies, and did n't have any major success until the late 1960s when she starred in `` Dames at Sea,'' an Off-Broadway spoof of the <LOCATION> Busby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> musicals that were popular 30 years earlier. When her theater career sagged in the early'70s, she turned to television and film. She was a regular on `` The <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> Show'' and also appeared on `` All in the Family.'' Her work on screen was less notable, with a minor role in `` The Longest Yard,'' a prison comedy starring <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, and parts in a pair of forgotten films, `` Ace <PERSON> Eli </PERSON>,'' and `` <PERSON> Rodger </PERSON> of the Skies.'' But at the same time, she was putting together a solo nightclub act to highlight her considerable skills as an actor and singer, and in 1974 she earned a <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> nomination as the lead in `` <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON>,'' a musical about silent film director <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sennett </PERSON> and his leading lady, <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Normand </PERSON>. In 1977, she met comedian <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and the two began a heavily publicized personal and professional relationship, starring in the films `` The Jerk,'' and `` Pennies From Heaven,'' during which they broke up. `` ` Pennies From Heaven' came out during Christmas and it was advertised as this wonderful Christmas musical,'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> recalled of the 1981 film for which she earned a Golden Globe Award. `` It was not just a happy musical.'' Although the movie failed at the box office, <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>' popularity was just about to take off. In 1984, she triumphantly returned to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>, receiving rave reviews for her performance as Dot in <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>'s production of `` Sunday in the Park With <PERSON> George </PERSON>,'' She earned a Tony nomination for `` Sunday'' and won the award two years later as the star of <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>'s `` Song and Dance.'' The actress talked about the unique experience of appearing alone in front of a live audience. `` You're there and I'm here and we're together,'' she said. `` We're here to have an experience. The audience was the other character, really. I was very lucky. It felt very odd to be up there with nobody.'' After completing a stint as the Witch in the <PERSON> Sondheim-James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapine </PERSON> collaboration, `` Into the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,'' she began working on `` Slaves of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' for which she had plenty of fellow actors but no audience. <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, however, enjoyed the experience and is anxious to make more movies. `` You connect with the moment and the other character and whatever's happening. I'm trying to surprise myself all the time. I think you're always learning, you're always surprising yourself.''

 For much of his career in <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> musicals, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> has been paid not to perform. You could find his name in tiny type in the Playbill, usually beneath a sentence solemnly proclaiming, `` Understudies never substitute for listed players unless a specific announcement is made at the time of the performance.'' From `` Good News'' to `` So Long, 174th Street'' to `` I Love My Wife'' to `` Little Me'' to `` Singin' in the Rain'' to `` Me and My Girl,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> has `` stood by'' or `` covered'' roles, terms used to describe that unsung hero of live performance _ the understudy. Now, in a reaffirmation of classic Broadway folklore, the understudy has become the star. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> has taken over the leading role in `` Me and My Girl,'' the long-running British musical about a cockney scamp who inherits a title and money but almost loses his girlfriend because of his new-found wealth. `` The day of my first performance here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, my wife drove me by the marquee, and I looked at it,'' he says. `` I had a double feeling. All at once, I was saying, ` I ca n't believe it.' But I also thought to myself, ` Yeah, it looks just like everybody else's name did up there.''' The 38-year-old <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> has been part of the `` Me and My Girl'' company since the show opened in 1986. He was the standby for its original star, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, and then for <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>'s replacement, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>. `` It was the best job in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> says. `` I could come in to work and check in at half hour -LRB- before curtain time -RRB- and then go to the theater or go to a restaurant or talk with a friend or read a book or do a crossword puzzle _ and I did all that.'' During <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>'s nine-month run, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> never went on for the star, but he played the role for about six weeks during <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>'s 20-month engagement Replacing a big name can be unnerving for a performer who must face the wrath of disappointed theatergoers expecting to see someone else. `` There is a good understudy mentality and a bad understudy mentality,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> says. `` You have to disregard the groans and the displeasure that the audience exhibits at the beginning of the evening and hold onto what you know the curtain call will be at the end of the evening. `` I remember going through a time when I thought ` How can I live up to what the audience expects?''' he adds. `` But you get over that. It's not your job to worry.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> originally took the job with `` Me and My Girl'' because he had heard the lead role was terrific. `` I also heard that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> was magic,'' he adds, `` I thought I could learn something from him, which, in fact, was the case.'' Last fall, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> in the national touring company of the show, playing three months around the country before coming back to the starring role in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Because we have good producers, they tried to find someone with a box-office name,'' he says. `` They did n't find anybody who fit all the requirements of the role and still had box-office impact.'' So <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> was chosen for the demanding part. Now he has thrown himself into a regimen _ a lot of rest and a lot of food so he'll have enough strength to get through the marathon workout But it's something he has worked for all his professional career Born and raised in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, he remembers discovering theater programs an aunt had brought back across the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. And he recalls lobbying to see either `` The Music Man'' or `` Gypsy.'' He did n't get to either one, but the theater bug had bit. In high school, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> appeared in a musical every year. The director, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, also ran a summer theater in Beach Haven on the <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> shore. `` He asked me if I wanted to be an apprentice there after my sophomore year of high school,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> recalls. `` In <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, there's not a lot to do in the summer, so I did. I was there five years, all summer.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> majored in theater at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and after graduating went out on the road with a long national tour of `` No, No, <PERSON> Nanette </PERSON>,'' starring <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Allyson </PERSON> and later <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION>. The director was <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Saddler </PERSON> who later cast <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> in the chorus of a revival of the 1927 college musical `` Good News.'' Since then, he has never stopped working in the theater. His stints have included roles in a revue `` <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'' and in `` 42nd Street,'' two shows where he did n't have to understudy anyone. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> also has been back to <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> to direct for <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> and has worked for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amsterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, directing and choreographing such old musicals as <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s `` Jubilee'' and <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>'s `` Sally.'' `` I find that everything is sort of a chain in show business,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> says. `` And I've been very lucky.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``New York Stories,'' ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen''</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Both movies were released March 10</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Arts Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 `` New York Stories'' It began as an excellent idea: Take three top American filmmakers, set them out on the streets of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and loop their efforts into one full-length feature to celebrate those collective talents and the city they supposedly enshrined. Unfortunately, the idea does n't quite gel with `` New York Stories.'' The Touchstone Pictures release consists of three vignettes by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> and <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. But only Scorsese's `` Life Lessons'' is worth the cost of today's pricey movie tickets. It's also the first story in the production so one can easily slip out at its conclusion and skip the next two. `` Life Lessons'' also is the only vignette that truly mirrors the spirit and attitude of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ in this case, the downtown art world. It has a feel, texture and mood, thanks in part to the gritty and witty original screenplay by Bronx-born writer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, and the sensitive and probing lens of the celebrated cinematographer <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Almendros </PERSON>. It is a tight short story, a film exposition that develops as brilliantly and explosively as the giant canvases <PERSON> Almendros </PERSON> so wonderfully captures with his camera. <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>'s `` Life Without <PERSON> Zoe </PERSON>,'' by contrast, is a shallow effort centered around the <LOCATION> Sherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, the privileged few and the superficialities of Eurotrash. It has nothing really to do with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and in fact concludes in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s `` Oedipus Wrecks'' justifies itself as a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> story with a cameo by Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and a throwaway line about how New Yorkers take certain bizarre happenings in their stride. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON> gives a memorable performance in `` Life Lessons'' as <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> `` The Lion'' Dolby, a brash, uncompromising, paternalistic artist whose brutal, expansive paintings match his passion and daring. He plays father to young women, taking them in as his art assistants and repaying them with `` life lessons.'' <LOCATION> Ahem </LOCATION>. His latest, <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Rosanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Arquette </PERSON> -RRB-, fancies herself an artist but has become smothered by <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON>. She's decided to leave him, but he lures her back with no strings attached. They resolve their relationship in a predictable way, but it's fun to watch. <PERSON> Arquette </PERSON> gives the same pouty, whiney, adenoidal performance she's given in such movies as `` The Big Blue.'' She's difficult to listen to, let alone watch. And she's dwarfed by <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON>. What a joy he is, from the opening shots of a paint-splattered cognac bottle, palette, cassette player and the artist himself staring at a blank canvas while Procul Harum's `` A Whiter Shade of Pale'' blasts through the studio, to his actual execution of the canvas. One feels his brush strokes, which surely no one lower than God is directing. `` Life Without Zoe'' offers little inspiration. Which is regrettable given the vision and talent <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> has displayed in other works: `` Apocalpyse Now,'' `` The Godfather,'' `` Tucker.'' The story concerns 12-year-old <PERSON> Zoe </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> McComb </PERSON> -RRB- who lives alone at the Sherry cared for by the hotel's male staff. She is spoiled, precocious and chatty. Her father -LRB- <PERSON> Giancarlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Giannini </PERSON> -RRB- is a world famous flute player and stays on the road. Her mother -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Talia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shire </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is an emotionally frayed photographer with an adolescent sensibility. She, too, would rather be on the road than home. These people do n't seem to like each other or their daughter very much. But it's difficult to like any of them. <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>'s characters are not real. One does not care about the distraught mother or the abandoned child, and the father comes across as a smarmy gigolo. There is a happy ending with a united family, but life would indeed be better without <PERSON> Zoe </PERSON>. The best thing about <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s `` Oedipus Wrecks'' is the title. After that, it's all down hill. The movie is only for those diehard <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> fans who get their jollies with endless jokes about the much-maligned Jewish mother, and who think that sitting with an analyst is a hip thing to do. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> plays a 50-year-old nebish who wants to marry the unobtainable WASP -LRB- <PERSON> Mia </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrow </PERSON> -RRB-. But mom's not too keen on this arrangement. Borrowing from his `` Purple Rose of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> employs an outlandish and bizarre trick that virtually leaves Mom in the sky. <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Questal </PERSON> is wonderful as the mother, and <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kavner </PERSON> _ the <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenstern </PERSON> of TV's `` Rhoda'' _ is more Jewish than <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> as the nice Jewish girl who gets the nice Jewish boy with a little help from Tarot, witch doctors, voodoo and tea leaves. The <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON> production was produced by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenhut </PERSON> and is rated PG.

 `` The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Hieronymus </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Munchausen </PERSON> was a German soldier and adventurer who lived in the 18th century. He also was a master prevaricator whose tales would shrivel <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunyan </PERSON>'s to munchkin size. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, a founding member of the irreverent <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON> troupe, has taken this legendary liar and made `` The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' the third in his fantasy triology that includes `` Time Bandits'' and `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.'' Where `` Time Bandits'' primarily had a comedic appeal to youngsters and `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'' tapped more philosophical and political chords, `` <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Munchausen </PERSON>'' is a priceless romp with more visual effects and excursions into pure fantasy than any movie in memory. There's even an unbilled cameo by <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> as the King of the Moon. The story opens in `` late 18th century, the Age of Reason, Wednesday,'' with an attack on an ancient city by the ferocious forces of the Ottoman Empire. A play about <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Munchausen </PERSON> is underway at a local theater, but the real baron is in the audience and takes issue with the mockery on stage. The movie soon becomes the baron's story. And the spectacle is nonstop: a hot-air trip in a balloon made of ladies' knickers that takes the baron -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Salt </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Polley </PERSON> -RRB-, a little girl who believes in imagination, to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and heaven; heads that separate from bodies; a Venus rising from a half-shell, complete with little angels with little wings; sea monsters; strange trees, creatures, seas. But there's so much more in <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>'s odyssey. The film is a wondrous and brilliant work whose underpinnings tap the very essence of imagination and conformity. The rigid bureaucrat <PERSON> Horatio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryce </PERSON> -RRB- questions the place of fancy, imagination and dreamers in the age of reason. There is n't one, he says. Fairy tales, however, never die. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeown </PERSON>, who also has the dual role of <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adolphus </PERSON>, wrote the masterful screenplay with <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Idle </PERSON> appears as <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Berthold </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> is Vulcan. The <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> release is produced by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuhly </PERSON> and is rated PG.

 Crude oil futures prices surged to a nearly 17-month high, fueled by a report showing a drop in inventories and ongoing signals that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is continuing to cut production. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the April contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, rose 48 cents Wednesday to close at $ 19.77 a barrel. The last time the near-month contract was higher was on Oct. 30, 1987, when the contract closed at $ 19.96 a barrel. On Monday, the April contract broke through the $ 19 mark for the first time since Jan. 19, closing at $ 19.03. On Tuesday, the contract rose to $ 19.29. Other contract months also recorded healthy gains Wednesday. Refined oil products also soared. The April contract for unleaded gasoline jumped 2.30 cents, settling at a 19-month high of 55.80 cents a gallon. The near-month contract last closed higher on Aug. 4, 1987, at 55.92 cents. Heating oil scheduled for April delivery rose 1.79 cents to close at 54.19 cents a gallon. Contracts scheduled for delivery later in the year also advanced sharply. Analysts said weekly statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> proved positive for the market. The report, released after the close of trading Tuesday, showed crude oil stocks fell 2.3 million barrels last week, gasoline dropped 4.7 million barrels and distillates, including heating oil, were down 5.9 million barrels. The drop in inventories reflected a sharp increase in demand, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, senior broker and analyst with <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Over the last four weeks, demand for oil products has jumped 9 percent, <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said `` I do n't know why,'' he said. `` It's contraseasonal in the case of heating oil and very bullish for the market.'' Traders said the strong demand for gasoline is due in part to concern about the availability of gasoline during the summer months when retail sales increase. Analysts have said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refining capacity is particularly tight this year and an extra burden is being placed on some refiners as several eastern states introduce new higher octane regulations. `` People thought we would see a buildup in stocks before Easter, or at least see them hold steady,'' <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said. `` I think right now the supplies are adequate but this new report brings into question whether we'll have enough.'' Prices also got a lift Wednesday from an unconfirmed report that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the largest producer among the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, was cutting production to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> customers, traders said. Despite the reports, the market's underlying fundamentals were strong to start with, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's an overall good indication of a healthy economy. And there's a good demand for crude because <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil producers seem to be serious about their price target.'' The 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries recently agreed to cut production in an effort to raise oil prices. The agreement took effect Jan. 1 and extends for six months.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Throws Out Arbitrator's Ruling in Morrell-Union Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An arbitrator's ruling that union workers who staged sympathy strikes should get their jobs back from <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morrell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was thrown out by a federal judge. Company officials called the judge's ruling Wednesday a major victory and said it frees <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> from any back pay obligation. The union promised to appeal. At the time the arbitrator made his ruling, a union leader said the back pay to the 2,400 workers who went on strike could amount to $ 40 million. In a 14-page decision, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Battey </PERSON> ruled that arbitrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rentfro </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> law professor, overstepped his authority when he decided in November that a six-month sympathy strike at <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>'s flagship plant in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> in 1987 was legal. <PERSON> Battey </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> does not have to follow <PERSON> Rentfro </PERSON>'s decision and rehire workers who were replaced during the sympathy strike `` We will immediately move to the 8th -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> and hopefully get the proper decision,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 304A in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. A year ago, a jury in <PERSON> Battey </PERSON>'s federal courtroom in <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> decided the 1987 sympathy strike and two one-day walkouts in 1986 were illegal. On Nov. 10, 1988, another jury awarded the company $ 24.6 million in damages. <PERSON> Battey </PERSON> said the issue of whether the jury decisions in both the liability and damage phases of the case are sound is a matter for the appeals court. In order to let the arbitrator's award stand, <PERSON> Battey </PERSON> said he would have to find that the company agreed to let <PERSON> Rentfro </PERSON> rule on the legality of the sympathy strike on the contract language alone. `` The suggestion that <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> agreed to submit the legality of the sympathy strike to arbitration after having secured a successful jury verdict flies in the face of common sense,'' the judge said. Last month <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> imposed a new contract on workers at the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> plant, cutting the wages of 2,000 employees by up to 18 percent. More than half the workers at the plant are replacements hired during the 1987 sympathy strike.

 Exports and imports both fell in January as the trade deficit declined to $ 9.49 billion, according to a government report that economists said may be good news for inflation. The decline in imports and exports could mean the rapid economic expansion is cooling slightly, removing some pressure on production costs and prices, economists said Wednesday after the release of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. The nation's merchandise trade gap fell 13.7 percent in January from a revised $ 10.99 billion in December, the department said. A big decline in consumer imports offset a higher oil bill. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks gained 14.29 points on Wednesday to reach 2,320.54. The dollar also was buoyed by the numbers, while the bond market, where pessimism is entrenched, ended the day roughly neutral after an early rally. The markets' overall favorable reaction showed how investors have been more worried lately about inflation than about the trade deficit. Ordinarily a decline in exports would be considered bad news because it delays shrinkage in the trade gap. But the 4.3 percent drop in exports in January was seen as favorable because it meant there was less pressure on the nation's factories to churn out goods for shipment abroad. A 6.9 percent drop in imports was also seen as good news because it meant declining demand for goods and services. Strong consumer demand and a strain on factory capacity have combined to increase inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has responded by pushing up interest rates, which has hurt stock and bond prices. Slackening growth could allow the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to ease off on interest rates. Still, other reports Wednesday showed that the economy's aging expansion continues to have plenty of strength. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said business inventories rose 0.7 percent in January while sales rose 1 percent. A report based on surveys by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s 12 district banks said the economy's growth is putting upward pressure on production costs and prices. `` Consumer spending, except for autos, has apparently gained momentum while manufacturing, especially for export, continues to show strength almost everywhere,'' according to the report, known as the Tan Book.

 Hotel developer <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have settled a $ 7 billion fraud conspiracy lawsuit less than two months before their case was to go to court, officials said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, owner of La Mansion Hotels in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, charged in a January 1988 lawsuit the insurance company, which financed construction of one of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s three hotels, conspired to acquire the hotels and replace the management with that of its own subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Doubletree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION>. As part of the agreement announced Wednesday, the 295-room La Mansion del Norte in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, which had been at the crux of the lawsuit, will be passed over to Metropolitan after an uncontested foreclosure scheduled for April 4. In return, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> will receive financing from Metropolitan so he can repurchase La Mansion del Rio, a 340-room hotel on the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walk </LOCATION> that opened in 1968, but which <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had to sell in 1986 because of financing problems. No financial terms of the deal were announced. The parties were scheduled to go to state district court on May 1. `` I am just absolutely, unequivocally overjoyed to be back in absolute ownership of La Mansion del Rio. It's meant a great deal to me since I built it in 1968 and it's meant a lot to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> in the city's growth in the past 20 years,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. He said because of an agreement signed with Metropolitan officials late Tuesday, he was unable to deviate much from a prepared joint statement. Metropolitan spokeswoman <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> also said she could not elaborate beyond the statement. La Mansion del Norte Hotel had been the subject of the battle between <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> and Metropolitan, which had financed about $ 11 million for construction on the hotel. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> claimed in the lawsuit that between 1981 and 1984, Metropolitan began thinking of taking over <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mansion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> after the insurance giant acquired 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Doubletree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION>. Metropolitan planned to foreclose on the hotel after <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he could n't make payments on it, but a restraining order pending the outcome of the lawsuit prohibited Metropolitan from pursuing the foreclosure. La Mansion Hotel in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, a 350-room hotel which opened in 1984, was foreclosed on in 1987 by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a servicing agent of Metropolitan. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was the hotel manager and he was replaced by <ORGANIZATION> Doubletree </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said last year that because of the slump in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy, he had approached Metropolitan about refinancing his loan for La Mansion del Norte, but Metropolitan officials declined and sought foreclosure. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> declined to elaborate on his financing structure for his planned expansion, which would include managing the hotels initially, before deciding on ownership or construction of new structures.

<HEAD>U.S. Oil Production Continues Decline</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Oil Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil production fell for the third straight month in February and overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude production continued to decline sharply, an industry trade group said. Imports also rose last month compared with the same time last year but consumption remained flat, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said in its monthly report Wednesday. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> production, which had offset declines in other parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recent years, fell by 100,000 barrels a day in February, while other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production dropped by 300,000 barrels a day, a total decline of about 5 percent, <ORGANIZATION> API </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The year-to-year declines in production indicate a continuation of decreases in lower 48 production as well as a flattening, if not a reversal, of an upward trend in Alaskan production seen during the last several years,'' the trade group said. Imports in February totaled 7.9 million barrels, compared with 6.9 million barrels at the same time last year, but receded from January's high of 8.2 million, the group reported. API, which represents major oil producers and refiners, said the January import surge reflected an effort by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil companies to take advantage of cheap and plentiful world oil before <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> began cutting back its output early this year. Imports now constitute over 40 percent of the oil consumed by Americans, a level that has raised concern about national security as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> becomes more dependent on foreigners for petroleum needs. `` The continued decline in domestic production and rise in consumption together imply underlying growth in imports of more than 10 percent per year,'' the trade group said. Contributing to the rise in overall imports last month was a strong increase in oil products such as heating oil and gasoline. For the first two months of 1989, product imports were up 20 percent over the same time last year. Also, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refinery capacity has shrunk in recent years and refineries are currently operating at more than 80 percent capacity. Gasoline deliveries, meanwhile, fell 1.5 percent from last February, due partly to a normal seasonal slowdown, the institute report said. Heating oil deliveries growth also dropped to 3.2 percent despite colder-than-normal February weather, <ORGANIZATION> API </ORGANIZATION> said. Despite the growing imports and slowdown in gasoline demand, total inventories fell by 8 million barrels in February, down slightly from January and from the same time last year, the report said.

<HEAD>Icahn Still Leading Potential Buyer Of Eastern, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wily financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the majority owner and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, remains the leading potential buyer of strike-torn <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, according to labor and financial sources close to the situation. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> expressed interest in buying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> last October, and the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, who struck the airline March 4, indicated last week they want him to explore a possible buyout. By acquiring Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> could use the airline's north-south routes as possible feeders into <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s trans-Atlantic network. The sale of Eastern is gathering momentum as an option for parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as the crippling strike against the carrier continues with no sign of resolution, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has asked his investment bankers at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to gauge potential interest in buying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> among investors and other airlines, the sources said. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> declined to confirm that it had been approached by <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> or make any comment on the issue, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Wall Street firm. On Wednesday, the 12th day of the strike, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> still was operating only a fraction of its normal flights. Furthermore, most of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots have continued honoring the strike despite appeals and warnings from management, making it virtually impossible for the airline to expand service. Eastern sought federal bankruptcy court protection from creditors last Thursday. But analysts and other observers suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> would have difficulty rebuilding Eastern through Chapter 11 and may be reaching a point where he is obliged to sell the ailing carrier to stem his losses. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> continues to lead the list of potential buyers, followed by <LOCATION> Grandview </LOCATION>, a group of investors and former corporate executives, the sources said. The <LOCATION> Grandview </LOCATION> group's strongest suit is said to be management expertise, giving it the belief that it could negotiate contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was unable to get. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and representatives of <LOCATION> Grandview </LOCATION> did not return phone calls Wednesday seeking comment. Last October, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> talked with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> about acquiring Eastern. The move came shortly after real estate developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> confirmed he was negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> about a possible purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s air shuttle operation. The planned shuttle sale, valued at $ 365 million, is awaiting the approval of the bankruptcy judge. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> dueled over control of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> over three years ago. A lot has changed since then, for both the men and the deregulated airline business. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> empire went on to acquire Eastern for $ 676 million after his <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> bid failed, may have decided that running a debt-burdened and fractious airline is too much trouble. Eastern has been fraught with labor agitation and staggering financial losses before and since <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> took over. For <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who has chased giant companies ranging from <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in recent years, the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would make <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline in terms of revenue passenger miles, an industry measurement of capacity. Some major airlines also have been rumored to be looking at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, but the reports have been denied by spokesmen for the carriers. The value of Eastern to potential buyers are its assets _ planes, airport gates, lucrative <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Florida </LOCATION> routes _ which they believe they could deploy more effectively than <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has, and thus turn the airline around.

<TEXT>
 A fraud probe into the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures exchanges coincides with a congressional review of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and has raised new questions about its ability to police abuses. Theoretically, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could decide not to reauthorize the 15-year-old regulatory body. But <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> officials say accusations that they have failed to curb corruption in the freewheeling futures pits are n't true. `` We've had these same kinds of criticisms from the start,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainbolt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer for commodities traders and brokers and a <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman. `` Everybody's got a vested interest in doing or saying whatever they need to promote their particular cause,'' he said in a recent interview. `` It's a combination of bureaucratic sour grapes, regulatory competition and power plays in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> was created in 1974 to enforce federal laws regulating the futures and options markets. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reauthorized it in 1978, 1982 and 1986. Lawmakers are considering legislation this year to extend its authority through 1994. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the commission, planned on a quick reauthorization process. However, its chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Eligio </PERSON> `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, ordered an in-depth review after learning of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation of alleged fraud and illegal trading on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures markets, the nation's largest. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe reportedly involves allegations that brokers and traders cheated customers out of millions of dollars in deals on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. An immediate question that surfaced in the probe was why the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> did n't root out such corruption if it existed. Futures trading had been regulated since 1936 by the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Rainbolt </PERSON> said the agency _ `` with 161 employees in the basement of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> and no real authority at all'' _ was unable to keep pace with growth in the industry. From 1969 to 1973, volume in regulated commodities doubled and trading in unregulated commodities quadrupled to create what a congressional report said was a $ 400 billion industry. With growth came the potential for abuses, such as the sale of unregulated options by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company that parlayed a $ 1,000 investment into a multimillion-dollar company by using new investors' money to pay old customers. The firm's collapse in the early 1970s, resulting in more than $ 71 million in customer losses, was cited as the catalyst for congressional action to scrap the exchange authority and create the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>. In a report on its activities in 1988, <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said the commission assessed more than $ 2 million in civil penalties for violating commodities laws last year, decided more than 500 reparation cases and issued more than 185 opinions and orders. Nonetheless, critics have branded the commission as lax and excessively reliant on industry self-regulation. The exchanges have their own operating rules, established in alliance with the industry-operated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. It, in turn, acts with approval of the federal commission. `` This whole system was born when the emphasis was to deregulate,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the subcommittee investigating the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> `` The issue, as we look at the whole system, is to reassess the entire deregulation mentality: Is it adequate? Does it need to be changed?'' Futures industry officials contend self-regulation works well. Some say the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> is too meddlesome now. `` Speaking as one of the regulated, I get mad at the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> and disagree with them every day,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Damgard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> trade group and a commodity purchaser himself. `` But the relationship is not so adversarial that we're unwilling to admit we have somebody over there who's smart, who understands our industry and who will listen,'' <PERSON> Damgard </PERSON> said. `` That is an agency that, over the last 15 years, has matured into one of the finest government agencies we have.'' Even if lawmakers reauthorize the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, some predict the debate will resurrect jursidictional arguments over who should regulate futures trading: the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> or the rival <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has been a better regulator,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, D-Tenn. `` You need a strong regulatory body, regardless of what its initials are, to police a group of very impressive _ and sometimes greedy _ traders and brokers.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is headed by investor <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>, has accumulated since last summer a 6.3 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that is now valued at about $ 1.15 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> has disclosed. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> officials said they viewed the purchases as a `` strong vote of confidence'' from the widely-respected investor, who with his wife controls 45 percent of the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb.-based <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. In a telephone interview Wednesday, <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> described the stock purchase as `` simply a passive investment'' and said he is happy with the way the company is being managed. <PERSON> Berkshire </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> is a diversified holding company. <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> has a reputation for taking sizeable stakes in a limited number of companies and hold them for a long time. The disclosure sent <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> stock up $ 1.25 a share to $ 51.50 in active trading of about 1.1 million shares on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goizueta </PERSON> disclosed the <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> holding in a memo to the soft drink maker's employees late Tuesday. He said <PERSON> Berkshire </PERSON> had accumulated 6.3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock over the `` last several months. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> has about 364 million shares outstanding. <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> said the stake amounted to about 22 million shares, accumulated by various insurance subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION> over the past eight or nine months. In his memo to the employees, <PERSON> Goizueta </PERSON> said the investment `` is in keeping with <PERSON> Berkshire </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON>'s track record of making long-term investments in companies with a strong consumer franchise and a focused business.'' He called it `` a strong vote of confidence and a welcomed endorsement of our past success and future potential.'' He also noted that <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> was `` one of the biggest fans of <ORGANIZATION> Cherry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'' and declared it the official soft drink of <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION> at that company's 1986 annual meeting. <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> acknowledged that he favors the drink, and said he has been `` very impressed by the international strength of the Coca-Cola brand and the job that management has done.'' He said his company had not previously disclosed the stake because insurance companies are not required to do so until their holding reaches 10 percent or stands at 5 percent at the end of a year. Federal rules require other shareholders to disclose a holding in a company when it reaches 5 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> is the world's largest soft drink maker. It earned $ 1.04 billion, or $ 2.85 a share, on revenue of $ 8.34 billion in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has about 1.14 million common shares outstanding, has a stock value of about $ 5.47 billion based on its closing price of $ 4,800 a share Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>, known as much for his folksy wisdom and unpretentious lifestyle as his financial acumen, has combined a patient, value-oriented stock strategy with a knack for finding investment diamonds in the rough. Forbes magazine estimates his personal wealth at about $ 1.4 billion. <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> cloth-milling concern with $ 10 million in assets, in the mid-1960s. Since then he has turned it into a diversified holding company with about $ 2 billion in assets. Most of <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION>'s operating revenue comes from insurance operations. The company also has interests in the publisher <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and in <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 A streamlined <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> will be just the right size, Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says. Shareholders voted Wednesday to sell <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest hospital management company, to a management-led group headed by <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> in a $ 5 billion leveraged buyout. One of the first orders of business is selling off three subsidiaries to repay a $ 1.3 billion short-term loan that will help finance the buyout and clear the way for <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>'s managers to run the hospitals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> owns 79 general hospitals and 52 psychiatric hospitals in this country and an additional 25 around the world. It manages 191 more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals and two in other countries, according to the company's 1988 annual report. `` It's very streamlined today, and I'm involved in the day-to-day operations,'' <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> said during a news conference after the shareholders meeting. He said the new company _ <ORGANIZATION> TF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>, which became <ORGANIZATION> HCA-Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday _ has no plans to sell its general hospitals. `` If you'd ask me what it'd look like one year from today ... we have approximately 80 today. I'd be quite surprised if we did n't have 80 then Maybe add one and sell one,'' he said. <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> said managing 70 to 80 hospitals is `` ideal.'' `` Basically, we're more focused,'' he said. <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> said he wants to sell the three subsidiaries _ <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> _ as intact units rather than breaking apart their assets. `` The idea is that we can now hopefully create three other companies that will stand on their own,'' he said. The new company is paying $ 51 a share for the more than 71 million outstanding shares of <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> stock, making the total purchase price $ 3.6 billion. Including debt, the deal amounts to more than $ 5 billion, <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. In a leveraged buyout, the assets of the company are used as collateral to borrow the money needed to purchase the company. Such a transaction usually increases a company's debt substantially. Taking the company private `` does permit us to be more long-term oriented, not quarter-to-quarter,'' <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> said. `` We can run things differently. There's no plans for layoffs or to squeeze this company down. ... It was the right thing to do at this time in our history.''

 The dollar finished higher against the Japanese yen today, while share prices erased earlier gains and lost ground on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 130.73 yen, up 0.85 yen from Wednesday's 129.88-yen finish The currency, which opened at 130.68 yen, fluctuated in a range of 130.60 yen and 130.95 yen. Dealers said the currency's strength in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed its gain in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, inspired by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report Wednesday that the nation's trade deficit fell to $ 9.49 billion in January from a revised December shortfall of $ 10.99 billion. A <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> dealer said `` there was no reason to sell the dollar'' considering the trade figures. Dollar-buying interest remained strong throughout the day, the dealer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Market players' dollar-buying interest will remain strong for a while,'' the dealer added. On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 376.13-point winner the previous day, erased its gains in the early session and lost 2.24 points, or 0.007 percent, to finish at 32,098.24. After moderate gains in the morning session, trading in the afternoon became directionless and fell, said a trader with a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, also speaking on condition of anonymity. Although trading was active, profit-taking by speculative investors in the afternoon session resulted in the Nikkei's loss, he added. Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.3 billion shares. `` But demand-supply balance in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market has been getting better,'' the trader added.

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Up, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar edged higher in light European trading early today despite what dealers said was a concerted bout of dollar-selling by European central banks. Gold prices fell. Dealers said several central banks, including <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, intervened together on the open market in efforts to curb the dollar's recent rise They said the size of the intervention was not immediately clear, but was large enough to temporarily interrupt the dollar's upward trend. A trader in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> predicted the central banks would be unable to dampen bullish interest in the dollar. `` They intervened to put the brakes on the dollar and to show the market that they are present,'' he said. The dollar headed sharply higher Wednesday after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government reported that the nation's trade deficit shrank to its lowest level in three months, from a revised December shortfall of $ 10.99 billion to $ 9.49 billion in January. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.85 Japanese yen to a closing 130.73 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it fell back to 130.27 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday's rates included: 1.8684 West German marks, up from 1.8670; 1.6060 Swiss francs, up from 1.6038; 6.3225 French francs, up from 6.3200; 2.1129 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1065; 1,370.50 Italian lire, up from 1,369.37; 1.1967 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1935 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.7225 from $ 1.7235 late Wednesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 390.40 a troy ounce, down from $ 392.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 391. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the noon bid price was $ 390.70, down from $ 393.25 bid late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 5.65 to close at a bid $ 396.89. Silver bullion fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a bid price of $ 6.07 a troy ounce from $ 6.12 bid late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Increased Plantings, Higher Fuel Prices Add to Energy Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers are expected to boost plantings of corn and some other major crops this spring, and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts say fuel needed to do their field work will cost more _ again. Energy prices overall are expected to edge up in 1989 due to higher crude oil prices, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in the March issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. `` Farm fuel prices rose slightly in 1988,'' the report said. `` As a result of higher crude oil prices in the last quarter of 1988, average petroleum product prices paid by farmers should rise throughout 1989.'' The report said the increase in crude oil prices during last year's fourth quarter was prompted by an agreement of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to hold down production. Under <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement in November, there would be a price target of $ 18 per barrel and a reduction in output from the 17-year high of 22.5 million barrels per day to 18.5 million per day in the first six months of 1989. The agreement also brought <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> back into the cartel with a quota equivalent to that of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the report said. According to Department of Energy forecasts, economic growth of about 2.5 percent will offset higher crude oil prices, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> petroleum consumption will therefore inch up about 1 percent this year. The report said that for the first time since 1980, domestic petroleum demand last year averaged more than 17 million barrels a day. Refiners paid an average of $ 14 per barrel in the last half of 1988, down 25 percent from 1987 prices. `` But prices surged near the end of 1988, and West Texas Intermediate -LRB- crude -RRB- reached $ 18 per barrel in January 1989,'' the report said. `` Crude oil prices are expected to range from $ 15 to $ 20 per barrel in 1989.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic production will probably slacken again this year to about 8 million barrels a day, down 200,000 from last year. And 1988 output of 8.2 million barrels a day was the lowest in 24 years. `` Expanding demand and decreasing domestic production are expected to boost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> net imports in 1989 to 6.8 million barrels per day, or 39 percent of domestic consumption,'' the report said. `` This rate may be compared with a record high import of 8.6 million barrels per day in 1977, and a low of 4.3 million in 1985.'' The energy supply and price outlook for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture mostly reflects world market conditions, currently characterized by abundant oil supplies and higher prices. `` In 1989, farmers can expect plentiful supplies of diesel fuel, gasoline and LP -LRB- liquefied petroleum -RRB- gas, but at slightly higher prices than last year,'' the report said. Yet, the combined use of gasoline and diesel fuel by farmers has declined in recent years because of improved farm production technology, shifts from gasoline to more efficient diesel units, and greatly reduced crop plantings. `` Although acres planted greatly influences the fluctuations in farm energy use, other factors also have contributed to the decline,'' the report said. `` Continued replacement of older gasoline machines with diesel-powered machines, particularly in the production of cotton, rice and some minor crops, has resulted in greater use of diesel fuel.'' Besides acreage cutbacks under some government crop programs, last year's drought-reduced yields also contributed to an estimated 5 percent reduction in farm fuel use in 1988, the report said. Lower grain moisture levels at harvest also reduced energy requirements. But expenditures for farm energy _ gasoline, diesel fuel, LP and electricity _ were about $ 7 billion last year, up 3 percent from 1977 because of higher prices and greater reliance on electricity. `` In 1989, energy expenditures, which comprise about 5.5 percent of total farm production expenses, are projected to jump 7 percent to $ 7.5 billion, largely due to an expected 4 percent to 11 percent increase in planted area of the eight major crops,'' the report said. This will offset long-term reductions in fuel use related to conservation, primarily from 28 million acres of land taken from production under the Conservation Reserve Program.

<HEAD>Investigators Who Cleared Suzuki Samurai Now Looking At Ford Bronco

<TEXT>
 Officials who cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samurai </ORGANIZATION> of allegations that it tends to roll over say that study has prompted an investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bronco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION>, which showed a far worse record of fatal rollovers. `` In the process of studying rollovers, we began to get curious about the Bronco,'' said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>. He said the inquiry covering all 1984-89 Broncos will try to determine if the vehicle, the types of drivers who use it, or the environment in which it is driven contributed to the fatal accidents. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it believes the record of its 590,000 Bronco IIs is not significantly different from that of other sport utility vehicles. `` The Bronco II is a well-designed, safe utility vehicle, and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> believes that the accident statistics do not reflect any safety-related defect,'' the company said in a statement from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. It added that accidents in all such vehicles are `` strongly influenced by adverse driver or environmental factors.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the company has done extensive testing on the <ORGANIZATION> Bronco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION> to verify it has `` reasonable and appropriate handling and stability characteristics.'' According to a Fatal Accident Reporting System study included in last year's report on the Samurai, 43 <ORGANIZATION> Bronco </ORGANIZATION> II single-vehicle rollovers resulted in fatalities in 1987, or 19 for every 100,000 vehicles on the road. There were eight fatal Samurai rollovers, or six per 100,000 vehicles; 13 involving the Chevrolet S10 Blazer or <ORGANIZATION> GMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION>, also six per 100,000, and six fatal Jeep Cherokee rollovers, for 2.5 per 100,000. The study gives no breakdown of which rollovers occurred in off-road conditions or other details about the accidents. The traffic safety administration will conduct an `` engineering analysis'' of the Bronco II, which is the second of three levels of investigation. In the Samurai investigation, which was completed last Aug. 25, the agency concluded that critics of the vehicle failed to demonstrate that it has an excessive tendency to roll over. The agency's Office of Defects Investigation denied a recall petition filed by the Center for Auto Safety, a public interest group often at odds with the industry and its regulators. Consumer Reports magazine, in a July 1988 issue, called for a ban of the Samurai, saying `` it literally trips over its own feet.'' The magazine's publisher, <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, also petitioned for standards covering all vehicles to prevent rollovers. Safety administration spokesman <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said that although the decision to conduct an engineering analysis of the <ORGANIZATION> Bronco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION> was formally based on complaints to the safety administration, it also is the result of the statistics that turned up in the Samurai investigation. In the Samurai inquiry, the agency described rollovers as `` complicated dynamic events'' and acknowledged that their causes are not entirely understood by automotive experts. It cited factors such as inexperienced drivers, lack of seat belt use, alcohol use, driver error, and poor weather as contributing to most of the Samurai rollover deaths.

<HEAD>IRS Answers Wrong 50 Percent in Some Areas</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employees in some parts of the country are giving correct answers to telephoned tax questions barely half the time, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> says. Nationwide, say auditors for the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is correct only 60 percent of the time _ not the 69 percent claimed by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> less than a week ago. Some of the answers that <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> considers correct could lead taxpayers to foul up their returns, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaube </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> director of taxpayer services, quarreled with the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> estimate _ but only slightly. `` As far as the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is concerned, whether we are answering 30 percent of the questions wrong or 40 percent of the questions wrong, either number is absolutely unacceptable,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations consumer subcommittee Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>' own tests of its telephone-assistance system indicate a performance no better than last year's, even though employees have had an extra year to acquaint themselves with the big 1986 tax overhaul. While the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> figures it is correct 69 percent of the time nationally, in some of the 29 calling sites the accuracy rate is in the 50s and in others it is in the 70s, <PERSON> LeBaube </PERSON> said. He did not identify those areas. In an effort to improve performance, <PERSON> LeBaube </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is switching to a more permanent work force, hiring fewer people to work only during the filing season. The agency also is assigning more supervisors and using new procedures to discover problem areas of tax law that are causing most problems for the telephone `` assistors.'' <PERSON> LeBaube </PERSON> advised taxpayers who call the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> toll-free numbers to write down their question, the date and name of the person who provided the answer. If an answer leads to an incorrect tax return and the taxpayer produces such a record, <PERSON> LeBaube </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will waive any penalty. `` The assistors are not properly trained to answer questions right 100 percent of the time?'' asked Rep. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>. `` That, to me, is really an intolerable situation. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> blames a complicated tax law for part of the problem, as well as the frequency of changes in the law. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> has said some <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees are reluctant to probe for additional information from taxpayers before answering their tax questions. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has about 5,000 employees answering telephoned tax questions during this filing season; about 1,500 of them are temporaries. All are required to have at least a high school education and receive at least five weeks' tax training. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> complaints that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> was overstating its accuracy rate prompted Chairman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Ga., to call his subcommittee into session for a rare public airing of a dispute between two government agencies <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agreed to work together on one test of the telephone-assistance system and hammered out 62 questions that <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> officials are expected to ask clandestinely about 15,000 times this filing season. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agreed to score answers in only three ways: Correct; correct and complete, or incorrect. After the tests got under way, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> wanted a fourth grade: an answer that while not technically correct likely would not result in a faulty return. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> refused to go along, contending some of those answers from <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees were potentially misleading. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> insisted and on its own beganscoring those answers _ which were 8.8 percent of the total _ as correct. Thus, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> came up with an accuracy rate of 60.4 percent. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> added the 8.8 percent in the fourth category and reached a total accuracy rate of 69.8 percent. Changing the method of judging the system in the middle of the test `` raises questions about the validity of its -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- reported results and whether it is making progress toward improving the accuracy of its responses,'' said <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stathis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was not our intent to mislead anyone,'' <PERSON> LeBaube </PERSON> told the subcommittee. `` In retrospect and in fairness to <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, we probably should have announced both numbers.''

<HEAD>Federal Help Needed to Stop Spread of Lampreys, Congressman Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Great Lakes region needs $ 9 million to buy the only known chemical to kill the sea lamprey and develop other means of controlling the parasitic eel or risk devastation of the salmon and trout population, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman says. Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that without the expenditure, the lamprey population could double by the year 2000. If the lampreys double, `` this will cause the salmon and trout populations to be cut in half, costing sport and commercial fisheries an annual economic loss of $ 1.4 billion and some 33,600 jobs in the Great Lakes basin,'' He said the regional <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, needs $ 9 million `` to keep the lamprey under control and the fishery thriving.'' Lampreys, native to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, entered the Great Lakes through the Erie Canal in the 1880s and decimated the trout, whitefish and chub populations. They attach to fish with their sucking mouthpiece and feed on body fluids, sometimes killing the host. `` Anyone who has been around long enough can remember a time when it seemed every trout and salmon pulled from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> had at least one, and sometimes more, lamprey eels stuck to their side,'' <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said. `` The lamprey eel devastated the Great Lakes fishing industry a few years ago, but we've come back from it.'' The only safe and effective lamprey killer is a chemical, <ORGANIZATION> TFM </ORGANIZATION>, that is manufactured in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said. But as the value of the dollar has dropped against the mark, the price of <ORGANIZATION> TFM </ORGANIZATION> has risen, he said. `` In an effort to find alternatives to the single-source chemical, we are requesting $ 1.3 million for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to develop a sterile male program to eradicate the lamprey population,'' he said.

<HEAD>Eastern Wins Order Against Competitors; U.S. House Asks Bush To Intervene</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Strike-devastated <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> won an emergency court order forcing rivals to honor pacts with the carrier, and a labor-backed measure won <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval despite resistance by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene in the dispute. The order granted Wednesday by a federal bankruptcy judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> prevents other airlines from refusing to transfer <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> passengers, cargo and baggage, a threat <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said could doom efforts to rebuild the airline. The judge set a March 24 hearing on continuing the emergency order. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 252-167 to approve labor-suported legislation that would require a recalcitrant <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint an emergency panel to try to end the walkout by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, pilots and flight attendants. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has strongly opposed intervention, and so has the Miami-based company. `` It's very clear many members were merely voting to satisfy a union constituency,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>, adding that management remains `` unalterably opposed to a presidential emergency board.'' Speculation also grew Wednesday that as the 13-day-old strike continues with no sign of resolution, selling the crippled carrier might be the only alternative for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of its parent, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s board reportedly has asked its investment banker, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to explore the possibility of selling Eastern to other airlines and investors, a move union officials found encouraging `` It should be very clear to Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and the bankruptcy court that any reorganization plan is going to have to be made workable by the employees, and they've shown they're not willing to work for him,'' pilots union spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. The idea of selling Eastern was raised again at a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> board meeting last week, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said he could not immediately comment on the report. Any such action must be approved by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who is overseeing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy reorganization. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> could hold a hearing within a week to 10 days on the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Northeast shuttle to billionaire developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>, president of the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION>. Union leaders were hoping to head off the sale of the lucrative shuttle by finding a friendly buyer for the entire airline. `` I ca n't understand any rationale for jamming -LRB- the shuttle deal -RRB- through if there is a potential buyer to take care of the whole problem,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of District 100 of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> spoke to corporate raider <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> several times last year about buying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and has been looking for investors to back an employee buyout. But <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the unions have n't had any direct contacts and could n't discuss any concessions they might make to a buyer. The strike began March 4 with a walkout by 8,500 mechanics and baggage handlers in a dispute over $ 125 million in proposed wage cuts and escalated with the support of pilots and flight attendants. Five days later, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy reorganization. Eastern has flown about 100 flights a day, compared with 1,040 daily before the strike began. <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was going ahead with plans to renew jetliner service Thursday on seven roundtrips daily between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but had no immediate plans to renew more routes. `` You've got to not only rebuild your flight schedule, but rebuild your passenger confidence,'' he said. `` We're taking on pretty short planning phases right now.'' <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said the company had nothing to say about where it would get more pilots to expand service. Eastern had about 200 pilots available, compared with 3,600 before the strike. The national <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has promised $ 2,400-a-month strike pay for Eastern pilots. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s 41,000 members at 47 airlines will be assessed $ 300 each to help pay for the strike pay package.

 Negotiations over the fiscal 1990 budget are getting down to the touchy topics of tax increases and entitlement cuts, but bargainers say decisions are still off on the horizon. `` Well, we're going to talk revenues and see where the conversation takes us,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Wednesday Although President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised no new taxes, his $ 1.16 trillion budget includes $ 14.2 billion in new revenues that need to be discussed, <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said. That figure includes new `` fees'' for government services and changes in the tax law that the White House argues are not tax increases. The heads of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> tax-writing committees were joining the budget talks for today's meetings. The conversation was also to touch on entitlement programs under those committees' jurisdiction Both Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., have said their panels would not approve the $ 5 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> cuts requested by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> has also nixed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to cut the tax rate on capital gains. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on Wednesday said $ 7.5 billion of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tax package was based on items <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> previously rejected or was unlikely to approve _ the capital gains tax, expanding the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> tax, and repealing a scheduled cut in the airport excise tax. `` I find it troubling that the administration, instead of showing leaderhip on this issue, is effectively leaving it up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to fill the gap,'' he said. `` I know very well the political constraints that the president is operating under, given the ` read my lips _ no new taxes' pledge he made during the campaign last year,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` But I must say in all candor ... I'm going to do my best to help him but it's hard to see how the numbers are going to add up. Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the appearance of the tax-writing committees in the budget talks did not mean that the panel was leaning toward a tax boost The negotiators wanted to `` ascertain from them what's realistic by way of spending restraints or what might be realistic by way of revenue enhancements,'' he said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, described the meetings as laying out the options rather than hard bargaining. `` We still have n't really begun what I would call serious negotiating,'' he said. Asked when the hard part would begin, he said, `` I thought it was going to start a long time ago, and so far it's still going pretty well,'' he said.

We all remember the concern expressed by delegates to the 19th national party conference when discussing the food supply situation in the country. We described this problem as ` our society's biggest wound.' The state has to buy large quantities of grain, meat, fruit, vegetables, sugar, vegetable oil and some other staples abroad. We are still behind developed countries, big and small, in labor efficiency, yield capacity and livestock productivity and in the diversity and quality of foodstuffs. The gap is widening rather than narrowing. The shortage of food creates social tension and generates not merely criticism, but actual discontent. Huge capital and other investments have been made in agriculture in recent years, but the inputs have failed to yield equally substantial results.'' Comrades, we should work out an agrarian policy that would enable us to blunt the sharp edge of the food problem in the immediate future and to grow enough farm produce, in terms of both amount and choice, to stabilize food supplies in the 13th Five-Year Plan -LRB- 1991-96 -RRB-. In the 13th five-year period, it is planned to increase the output of foodstuffs by 26 percent to 30 percent, while the output of farm produce will grow by 16 percent. _ On <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s brutal collectivization of agriculture: In the process of combatting the kulaks, violence was inflicted upon the huge mass of middle-strata peasants and even poor ones Millions of peasants, together with their families, were torn away from their land plots and native areas and suffered misfortunes, often dying in camps and exile. _ On leasing: Let us not fix assignments, let us not set deadlines The point at issue is the transfer of land and other means of production to lease-holders, their real control over those means. ... If the plenum backs the relevant proposals of the Politburo, the Presidium of the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> Supreme Soviet and the government, and we adopt corresponding documents, this will create legal and economic prerequisites for an extensive transition to leasing. _ On price reform: The purposes of economic restructuring can not be achieved, new methods of economic management can not be introduced and a socialist market can not be formed without a price reform ... Purchase prices of some kinds of quality products are so low as not to stimulate the development and rational distribution of specialized highly marketable production. The documents circulated among you envisage the introduction of new purchase prices of farm produce as of Jan. 1, 1990. ... The range of products priced in a centralized way should be reduced. _ On banks: There is a need for radical restructuring of the activity of banks, particularly of the agro-industrial bank It is necessary to ensure that they are really interested in the development of production and act as business partners. _ On the independence of agricultural enterprises: Agricultural enterprises are really doubly dependent On the one hand, they are subordinated to higher bodies along the departmental line. They are also managed in no less, perhaps even in a greater degree, by local party and government bodies, starting from the district level. Perestroika presupposes a radical change in the system of managing the agrarian sector at all levels. ... We proceeded from the assumption that no one should interfere in the day-to-day economic activities of collective and state farms, and still less with peasant and individual small holdings. _ On equipment problems in agriculture: Workers of the agrarian sector rightly complain that the machine-makers, abusing their monopoly status, often foist upon them outdated models of expensive machines with low dependability and efficiency standards This is ruinous not only for agriculture, but for the country as a whole. We produce more tractors than any other country in the world, and yet complaints about their short supply are common. ... Machine-makers should be put in such economic conditions that would rule out the manufacture of shoddy equipment. _ On waste in agriculture: Our losses in grain harvesting and pre-storage treatment amount to 15 million and even 20 million tons About as much is lost in storage and processing. In all, comrades, the losses equal our purchases abroad. Due to the sparsity of meat packing plants, their low technological standards, and inefficient use of raw material, meat losses, even according to the lowest estimates, add up to around 1 million tons. This despite the acute shortage of foodstuffs. Such is the dimension of the problem. Many problems stem from the methods of economic management, people's attitude to work and their poor motivation to achieve better end results. _ On ecology: What must be done as a matter of urgency is putting reclaimed lands in proper order and taking measures to put land and water to more rational use Efforts to come to grips with ecological problems that have piled up should not be put off either. We should drastically raise standards and increase accountablity when it comes to the production, transportation and storage of chemicals and especially their application to the soil. _ On life in the villages: The peasant mode of life has lost its attractiveness and prestige People, above all the young, are leaving villages. The disregard for the needs of villages and the hypertrophied urban development brought about great social distortions and complicated the normal economic functioning of whole regions. The rates of house building in villages in the 13th five-year period must at least be doubled. Villagers justly raise the issue why rural areas have been put on ` short rations' and why peasants have been left to struggle with their problems alone, although the country has vast resources.

<HEAD>House Sends Bill To End Eastern Walkout To Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation that would force President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike faces stronger opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passage has already given organized labor a morale boost. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the union-sought measure 252-167 on Wednesday, largely with the support of the chamber's majority Democrats. Only 20 Republicans supported the legislation, and just 15 Democrats voted against it. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes the bill, and Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are expected to maneuver to try to block it. That chamber's tricky procedures often allow a minority of legislators to wreak havoc on legislation they oppose, and the bill is given only a long-shot chance at ever becoming law. Nonetheless, lobbyists for organized labor, who have rallied around <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s striking unions, say they will push hard for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage. `` We trust they'll take it up,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlotten </PERSON>, director of legislation for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, said after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> begins a two-week recess after Friday's session, and supporters of the measure say they would like to see an effort to take up the bill before the break. Time is a factor in the dispute, with striking workers needing money to pay their bills and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> already having obtained protection from creditors under the bankruptcy code's Chapter 11. Eastern is demanding $ 125 million in wage and benefit concessions from members of its machinists union, which wants $ 50 million in improvements. The walkout has forced Eastern to fly only about 100 flights daily, compared to 1,040 before the strike. The measure would require a cooling-off period of up to 26 days and force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint an emergency board, which would study the dispute and recommend a solution. Neither Eastern nor the 8,500-member <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, which began its walkout March 4, would be required to accept the proposed formula. But even if the measure goes no further than the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, it has already has cheered labor and its Democratic allies. House passage is a morale-booster to the striking machinists and to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and flight attendants, who have also walked off their jobs. It's an indication to the labor movement that after eight years of rough times under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, it is still capable of mustering support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. And it has forced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Republican lawmakers to appear to be defending <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has been accused by workers of trying to break <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions and dismantle the company, and his business practices are often criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> Rep. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON>, D-Calif., called <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> `` the neutron bomb of the airline industry, saving assets as booty and taking the people and letting them go. But Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, R-Calif., told a reporter, `` I have n't heard any Republican stand up and defend <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> The bill's opponents say the Eastern walkout has caused inconvenience but not a transportation emergency that requires government intervention. They also note that Eastern and the machinists began bargaining for a new contract in October 1987, and say there is no reason to believe an emergency board would be successful. Supporters argued that the emergency board would provide cover for the two sides to be able to accept a solution to their bitter dispute without appearing to have given in.

<HEAD>Attorney General Group Targets Car Rental Practices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The top justice officials from all the states are targeting rental car practices, especially the expensive collision damage waivers and ads that they say conceal the true cost of car rentals. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorneys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> adopted guidelines this week aimed at encouraging more accurate price disclosure and advertising by the rental companies. The group issued the guidelines after their annual meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ended Tuesday, and after reviewing the proposals with car rental companies. `` Our investigation uncovered major and pervasive problems in the advertising and pricing practices throughout the car rental industry,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> attorney general, said Wednesday. `` In all too many instances, consumers have found it virtually impossible to rent an automobile for the price trumpeted in the rental company's ads.'' Illinois Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said his state is considering filing a lawsuit over allegedly misleading advertising by car rental companies. He said that when the attorneys generals' task force began looking into the rental practices a year ago, `` rental car ads routinely promised low prices that were in fact a complete fiction, with a bewildering variety of surcharges, fees and other mandatory add-ons that drove the final price much higher.'' <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> said the industry has since moved to improve advertising and eliminate misleading information on prices. The guidelines are voluntary and intended to advance uniform enforcement by providing guidance for the states in enforcing their own consumer protection laws, and for the companies to avoid violating state consumer laws. Under the guidelines: _ Mandatory fees, such as fuel surcharges, must be included in the advertised price of a car _ Advertised prices must `` clearly and conspicuously'' disclose key restrictions and conditions, such as geographic or time limitations on price, requirements for advance payment, and the cost of collision damage waivers _ Companies must maintain enough cars available at the advertised price to meet reasonably expected demand, unless the ad clearly states supply is limited The group's task force that investigated car rentals said it found a series of `` deceptive, unfair or unconscionable practices'' involving the waivers, including pressure to purchase them by rental agents who made commissions on the sale. In many cases, a driver's personal insurance would cover repairs. The attorneys general recommended state legislatures adopt one of three proposed reforms: _ Prohibit the practice of charging for accidental damage or theft, thus eliminating the need for the waivers _ Limit the amount of money for which consumers can be held liable to $ 500 or less _ Require the cost of waivers to be regulated by the state through its insurance department or other regulatory agency <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the guidelines had been reviewed by the car rental industry and that the industry generally had no objection. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest car rental company, said it supports the proposed guideline and said it will permit comparison shopping. <PERSON> Demetria </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudar </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the second largest rental company, said it supports the guidelines.

<TEXT>
 A congressional subcommittee wants to question more than 60 government officials and employees in its investigation into alleged improprieties in the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s processing of generic drug applications A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> reportedly is conducting a criminal investigation into the matter, based on information the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations uncovered last summer. The subcommittee's investigation is proceeding independently of the criminal investigation, said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., subcommittee chairman, and Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the panel <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said Wednesday that the investigation centers on `` the question of whether <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> processed generic drug applications fairly and in accordance with the law.'' <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON> said the panel's focus `` is on the approval process and whether or not it has been conducted in a fair and impartial manner.'' A report in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week quoted sources as saying the grand jury was investigating allegations that <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> employees took bribes and accepted favors to approve companies' applications to market generic drugs. The newspaper quoted one source familiar with the investigation as saying indictments could be returned by the end of the month. Generic drugs are low-cost versions of brand-name drugs. Once the patent for a brand-name drug expires, companies can copy the compound and apply to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for approval of a new generic drug. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON> sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, whose department includes <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, telling him subcommittee investigators want to question employees at <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and in the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> general counsel's office. The lawmakers provided <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> with a list of 64 employees the investigators wanted to interview, but the subcommittee did not identify them. A subcommittee source said all but four of those on the list work at <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and they reach as high in the agency as Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> noted in the press release that `` just because a government employee is questioned in an investigation of this magnitude does not imply any wrongdoing on their part.'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON> told <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> that investigators wanted to complete the interviews by the end of the month. They also submitted a list of documents for the department to produce by March 24 and noted that most items on the list `` have been the subject of outstanding requests since last summer.'' <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said the agency had no comment, but he said, `` We of course will cooperate with the investigation. The agency is anxious to have everything resolved.''

<HEAD>Chileans Angered Over Tainted Fruit Incident In U.S.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With millions of pounds of Chilean fruit being held for testing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports because of a cyanide scare, producers and workers whose livelihoods depend on fruit exports seethed with anger. `` Buy! Buy! Do n't believe the gringos' lies!'' a <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> street vendor of grapes chanted Wednesday. Some passersby laughed and many made purchases. Producers and union officials say thousands of industry workers have been laid off as a result of the scare. On Monday, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urged consumers not to eat Chilean fruit after two grapes imported from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> were found to be tainted with cyanide. Most Chilean fruit was pulled from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets' shelves. Similar decisions were taken by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and several western European countries said they were tightening controls on Chilean fruit. Chilean exporters, growers and packers voluntarily suspended all operations Tuesday for 72 hours to allow thousands of crates of stored fruit to be checked. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that `` not a trace'' of any alien substance had been found in the crates of fruit ready for export that had so far been checked. Officials of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military government say preliminary estimates indicate the crisis could cost <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> at least $ 800 million. Nearly 65 percent of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s fruit exports _ grapes, melons, apples and peaches _ go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the country is at the peak of its fruit harvesting season. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese embassies in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> received anonymous telephone calls earlier this month saying fruit exports would be poisoned. An investigation turned up nothing, authorities said. The Chilean agriculture minister, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Sotta </PERSON>, says the cyanide found in the two grapes in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on March 2 amounted to 0.52 parts per million. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said a child would have to eat 2,000 grapes to ingest a fatal dose. Wednesday afternoon, several of the nation's leading fruit exporters toured the capital's center street with pick-up trucks loaded with fruit, and gave away grapes and apples to the public. Hundreds of people enthusiastically ate them. Organizers said the idea was to show the world Chilean fruit is safe. Most Chilean fruit enters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through the port of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, others through <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Boats containing hundreds of thousands of crates of Chilean fruit awaited off <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> as fruit inspections continued. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials completed sampling Wednesday of the 362,000 crates of grapes and other fruit from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. No further contamination was found. In <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Seguel </PERSON>, called the decision to remove the fruit from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stores `` totally out of proportion.'' <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said nearly 40,000 workers had been laid off by Wednesday, but union leaders put the figure at 17,000 workers. `` The consequences of the thoughtless <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision are worse than those of several earthquakes,'' <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> told a Wednesday news conference. `` It is totally irresponsible to react like that because of two tainted grapes, just two grapes, not two clusters.'' `` I directly accuse the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of paving the way to terrorism against the international food trade in the future,'' <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> said. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision will encourage terrorists in the future. The Chilean govenment officialy blamed the tainting of the grapes to `` terrorism backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' The communists denied the charge. Angry reactions came from other quarters, too. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardon </PERSON>, president of the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision `` an agression, almost an act of war.'' He blamed `` certain sectors of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' which he said were influenced by Chilean opposition politicians. Scores of citizens interviewed by radio and TV stations also strongly criticized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision, calling it exaggerated.

 Consumers flocked to organic produce markets throughout <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> following reports of tainted Chilean grapes and unsafe apples. `` The Chilean situation on top of the Alar scare boosted sales phenomenally,'' said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Musante </PERSON>, produce manager at the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co-op </ORGANIZATION>. She said Wednesday that sales of organic produce jumped about 30 percent in the past week. Other organic produce markets reported similar increases in sales as a result of the Chilean fruit scare and a recent report claiming a cancer risk of a chemical called Alar used on some apples. `` We're seeing about 30-35 percent increase in our vegetable sales and a six-fold increase in sales of organic juices,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, owner of the Good Nature Grocery in <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns six stores in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said its sales rose at least 25 percent since both stories broke. The discovery of cyanide in seedless red grapes from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, which followed a threatening phone call to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, spurred the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to recommend that grocers strip their shelves of fruits imported from that country. Meanwhile, a report last month by the private <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> charging that children are at risk from Alar led schools nationwide _ including <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ to ban apples. Alar, the brand name for daminozide, is used to improve the coloring of apples and slow ripening. But it is suspected of causing cancer. In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON>, an owner of six Mrs. <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON>'s markets, reported record sales <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaskey </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Erewhon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, estimated a 5 percent increase in customers. Traditionally, organic produce sales have been through farmers' markets and health food stores, and more recently through grocery chains `` But there's certainly not enough certified product to handle the demand,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, administrative assistant for <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz-based </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Certified Organic Farmers, an association of about 400 growers. `` Obviously, there's a big demand for it right now,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, co-owner of Cal-Organic Farms south of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>. `` Even before the publicity there was a steady flow, but now the interest level has increased drastically.'' Under <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law, produce can be called organic if no synthetic chemicals have been applied since 12 months prior to planting or bud break, said <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>. The organic farmers group goes even further before certifying a farm as organic. The process takes at least a year and includes soil residue analysis, inspection of the farm by an independent inspector, a notarized affidavit and full disclosure of materials used in production and a land history for 10 years, <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said.

 A leading poultry producer destroyed 400,000 chickens in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> after discovering they were contaminated with a banned, cancer-causing pesticide, according to a published report. <ORGANIZATION> Townsend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poultry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> finished destroying the chickens Wednesday in the most serious incident of pesticide contamination in the history of <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>' $ 3 billion poultry industry, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. The discovery in January of the presence of the pesticide heptachlor led the company to destroy the chickens over the last month at its north-central <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> plant. The contamination was discovered in meat that was being delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant at <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>. The Campbell plant processes chickens for use in Swanson-brand frozen dinners. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s routinely tests its meat for about 300 pesticides. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> discovered levels of helptachlor contamination in the Townsend chicken ranging from 0.05 parts per million to 2.4 parts per million in its routine quality control testing. The level considered safe by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> is 0.3 parts per million. Investigators in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> believe the contamination was caused by sorghum seeds sprayed with heptachlor and sold illegally as feed grain, the Times reported. `` I've been feeding chickens since 1963, and nothing like this has ever happened to me,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Strain, who raises chickens for the company. `` I'm worried people might get the wrong idea and stop eating chicken.'' Government officials said none of the tainted chicken in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> reached the market, the Times reported. The Townsend plant in <LOCATION> Batesville </LOCATION>, which processes 80,000 to 90,000 chickens a day into parts that are sold in bulk packages, shut down voluntarily for 11 days. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanemburg </PERSON>, the plant manager, said the Delaware-based company may spend $ 3 million to $ 5 million to recover from the incident. The chickens that were destroyed were valued at $ 600,000. The company has instituted new procedures that include the testing of all the grain used in chicken feed and residue tests of chickens before they are slaughtered, the Times said. Heptachlor was banned in the 1970s after it was found to cause cancer in animals. It was banned for use in food in 1978.

<TEXT>
 State representatives have approved a bill that could make <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> the third state to legalize casino gambling. The proposal approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 57-42 Wednesday would limit the operation to a five-year pilot project in the northeastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>. The bill was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where a Democratic leader predicted passage, but Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> refused to say whether he would approve the proposal. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Meshel </PERSON>, a Democrat, said he thinks the bill could provide a badly needed economic boost for northeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, `` and I have n't heard a lot of opposition to it. I think it's going to pass. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> are the only states that have legalized casino gambling. Debate in the House involved claims that the bill would damage the state's image and hurt its economy.

 Discovery's astronauts today enjoyed the first home delivery in space of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> newspaper. A facsimile machine flying in orbit for the first time was used to send Discovery a copy of the front page of The Roundup, an employee weekly at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. And it was delivered in space before it was delivered on the ground. The issue had been rushed into print by editor <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON> so that it could be sent to the space shuttle today. The paper will not be distributed on Earth until Friday. Discovery astronaut Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON> stopped his work in space long enough to read the newspaper and comment to <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` Thanks for the home paper here, the Roundup,'' he said. `` We wanted to tell you that's the first newspaper that's been sent to an American spacecraft,'' replied <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Thuot </PERSON>, capsule communicator at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a good thing that it's you who is there because if it was <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> -LRB- Low -RRB- I would expect that he would have sent me up the Wall Street Journal,'' joked <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Low </PERSON>, who is known to take an interest in finance, is capsule communicator on an earlier shift. The first newspaper in space carried a lead story about the Discovery launch on Monday and a story at the bottom of the page about a welcome home ceremony at Johnson for the five-man crew, which returns on Saturday. There also was a story about American-Soviet cooperation in the exploration of space and a feature about the value of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> photos taken by shuttle astronauts. The facsimile machine aboard the shuttle is used to send instructions and daily schedules to the astronauts.

<TEXT>
 A 25-year-old computer hacker once declared `` a very, very great danger to the community'' pleaded guilty to computer fraud in a plea bargain with federal prosecutors. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> would be sentenced to 12 months in prison and three years on supervised release under terms of the agreement. The pudgy, youthful looking <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> was described by friends as a computer genius who called himself `` Condor'' and was capable of infiltrating any computer system. <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges he infiltrated <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s computer system and stole one of its programs, and admitted stealing 16 <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> telephone codes and using them to make phone calls. It was not clear whether the long distance codes were used to access computer systems. Prosecutors agreed to dismiss two additional charges, one of which alleged that <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> infiltrated the computer system of <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mariana </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfaelzer </PERSON> declined prosecutors' recommendations until <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> is interviewed by probation department authorities She noted that he has a prior conviction for similar activities in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, and set sentencing for April 24. At a bail hearing on Jan. 3, <PERSON> Pfaelzer </PERSON> denied bail for the defendant, saying <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> posed `` a very, very great danger to the community'' _ reflecting public comments made by assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidman </PERSON>. Even <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON>'s access to the telephone was restricted. <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, has maintained that prosecution comments about the case were wildly exaggerated On Wednesday, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said outside court that <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> had expressed a desire to undergo psychological counseling, which also was part of the plea agreement. `` He's a very talented man with a lot of ability and for whatever reason ... there's been a misuse of that ability,'' said <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. `` A computer company that could harness his abilities would really get a talented employee.'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> never intended to damage computer systems or to sell information for profit. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Asperger </PERSON> said the government based its sentencing recommendation on <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate that <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON>'s actions had cost the firm between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 in `` down time'' on its computer He said the computer system had to be shut down while the firm looked for damage. The government's initial estimates of damage to <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s system were set at $ 4 million. It turned out there was no damage to the overall system, <PERSON> Asperger </PERSON> said, although <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> was able to steal and copy one program. <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> already has served more than three months in prison, and <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> added, `` He'll be out by Christmas.''

<HEAD>Japanese Official Recommends Killing More Whales Next Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s research whaling program is too small to be scientifically accurate, so more whales should be killed next year, the head of the program said today. <PERSON> Fukuzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagasaki </PERSON>, director of the semi-governmental <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cetacean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, said the 300 whales being caught by Japanese ships in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> this year are not enough to make an accurate assessment of whale stocks and should be increased to 825 next season. Critics have charged that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is using the research program to continue its whaling industry despite a worldwide moratorium on commercial whaling imposed in 1986 by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> officially ended its commercial whaling at the end of the 1986-87 season, when it caught 1,941 whales. The following season it told the commission it would kill 875 minke and sperm whales for research purposes, which are permitted under the commission's charter But strong opposition from international environmental groups and some commission members led <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to cut back the research program's goal last season to 300 minke whales Japanese whalers actually caught 273 minkes during the year, officials say. `` The sampling method we applied worked very well, so we are sure that this method can be applied to somewhat larger-scale research,'' <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` We are thinking of resuming our original plan from next year if circumstances permit.'' The whale meat obtained by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s research program is sold for food, as permitted under <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulations. The whaling fleet, made up of one mother ship and three catcher boats, is due to return to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> about April 20, he said. The commission passed the whaling moratorium to allow whale populations to be studied without being hunted. The ban is to be re-evaluated by the commission next year, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> hopes its research will show that some species, such as the smaller minke, are plentiful enough to allow a limited resumption of commercial whaling. Current estimates of minke populations range from 400,000 to 700,000.

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders today rallied around President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan to give peasants control of the land they farm and the crops they plant in a drive to overcome chronic food shortages, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Speakers urged the 300-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to approve the radical reform plan, which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said would end decades of `` power and pressure methods'' that have brought disaster to the Soviet countryside, according to the official news agency. In a nearly two-hour speech on Wednesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> painted a bleak picture of Soviet agriculture, with chemically despoiled land, investments gone sour and the deliberate destruction of traditional systems. The situation is so bad that it will be years before the country can feed itself, he said. The Central Committee was expected to approve the policy today, although conservatives such as agriculture chief <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> have not been enthusiastic about leasing collective farm land to families and groups. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s detailed report on years of failed reforms made it clear that he believes nothing less than radical change will free Soviets from rationing of meat and cheese now found in many cities. His proposal to abolish a government superagency created in 1985 to oversee the country's farm sector was a tacit acknowledgement of the failure of even his early attempts to revitalize agriculture. Essentially, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan would give farmers freedom to choose their own crops, equipment and markets. Prices would be adjusted and eventually nearly decontrolled. A draft law on leasing was presented to the party, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said it could be decreed by the government Presidium. That implied he would not wait for installation of the nation's new parliament, which is expected in May. It will take time, however, to replace the current system with one allowing farmers to choose and pay for their own seed, equipment and fertilizer. Leasing experiments have been going on for a year, but approval of the plan would make leasing standard rather than the exception. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called food shortages `` our society's biggest wound.'' Meat, sugar and many other foodstuffs must be rationed in numerous Soviet regions. The Central Committee began a two-day meeting Wednesday largely devoted to agricultural reform, seeking ways to increase the food supply and improve dreary rural life. When <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> forced agricultural collectivization in the 1930s on a populace that was 80 percent agrarian, millions of peasants were deported to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and other remote regions or fled to cities. Catastrophic famine ensued. Ever since, farmers working for state-owned farms have generally delivered their yields to market at fixed prices to meet quotas set by the state bureaucracy. The 58-year-old <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the former party overseer for agriculture and son of a Russian peasant, said conditions in some rural regions were causing mass migration to cities. In 1988, gross Soviet farm output rose by just 0.7 percent, and grain harvested was only 195 million metric tons, 16 million below the annual average achieved in 1986-87, according to Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> PlanEcon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said lease-holders should be given a virtual free hand He has said leasing guarantees higher production because lease-holders can earn more if they work harder, rather than getting a fixed salary regardless of output. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` more flexible prices'' for crops purchased by the state would go into effect Jan. 1, and the number of products for which prices are fixed would be reduced. However, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said food shortages could not be expected to end until the mid-1990s. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> has emphasized collective farming _ the system that has left Soviets standing in line for meat and vegetables. No one proposed letting farmers own outright the land, or the breakup of the collective and state farms that have been the backbone of the Soviet agricultural system since the 1930s.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION>, the Dutch aerospace group that was near collapse just 16 months ago, is close to wrapping up a $ 3 billion deal involving the sale of 150 passenger jets to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a company spokesman confirmed today. `` We're discussing the final minor details'' on the deal, valued at 6.5 billion guilders, or $ 3.09 billion, said <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON>. The sale includes 75 firm orders and 75 options that are to be placed by the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, - based airline for <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION>'s 100-seat F-100 twin jet, a plane for feeder routes of up to 1,100 nautical miles, van <PERSON> Veen </PERSON> said It was not immediately known when the contracts would be signed, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON> said. American's order, considered a crucial breakthrough for <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation market, was billed as the largest-ever deal in Dutch industrial history. The deal, which took five years to negotiate, is the latest stage in the recovery of the Dutch aviation company, which almost collapsed in 1987 under the financial burden of developing two new models, the F-100 and the F-50 propjet. In a controversial bail-out that year, the Dutch government put up 212 million guilders to support <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION>. The move, involving the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> stock at roughly $ 10 a share, resulted in the government becoming the majority shareholder with a 31.8 percent interest. `` It looks like the government did a good deal,'' said <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON>, noting that at midday trading on the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> bourse, <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> shares were up 3.70 guilders to 45.80 guilders, or $ 21.80 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION>'s order books for the F-100 now show 212 firm sales and 178 options, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON> said, adding that `` American's options may be described as very firm ones.'' Among other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-100 buyers is Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, which has 20 planes on order. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON> said that since <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> production line has an annual maximum capacity of 46 F-100 jets, `` we're now looking to expand our production capacity'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, or at home. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> has had talks with <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to set up a second F-100 production line, while the Dutch company also is involved in takeover talks concerning <ORGANIZATION> Short </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 The Contra army stranded near here may be a headache for diplomats and a political problem in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but it has also brought a minor economic boom to the isolated valleys of eastern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` I'm doing very well.

<HEAD>Perfume Czar Hopes To Build House Of Fragrances Starting With 273
Address</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON>'s blueprint for building the first American `` house of fragrances'' specifies a pyramid-shaped cornerstone. <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON>, the man behind one of the perfume industry's most successful scents, is introducing a new concoction that he thinks may create an even bigger splash than <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>. His new fragrance is called `` 273'' for the address on Rodeo Drive of the sumptuous <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> boutique that was the birthplace of the <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> perfume. It comes in a crystal flacon designed by <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> in a pyramid shape. If his dreams of 273's popularity come true, <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> says he intends to expand his fragrance collection under the provisional banner <PERSON> Clientele </PERSON> <PERSON> Privee </PERSON>, his interpretation of a Parisian perfumery. But <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> does n't want an exact repeat of the Giorgio success story. That fragrance family, which he sold to cosmetics and toiletries company Avon for $ 165 million in 1987, became phenomenally popular after its debut in 1981. Despite <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON>'s emphasis on exclusivity, <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> eventually became widely available in department stores and elsewhere, losing some allure in the process. <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> says it was difficult to resist demands from retail outlets clamoring to stock <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON>. `` But I will this time because I'm convinced small is beautiful,'' says the man who pioneered the use of `` scent strips'' in magazines, as a come-on for <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> At first, 273 will be sold solely through the boutique that has been rechristened `` <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>.'' It's pricey, having an elevated `` prestige'' status among its perfume peers. One ounce of the perfume costs $ 185 and 2.5 ounces of the cologne goes for $ 45. If demand for 273 takes off, <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> will face some ticklish marketing. Prestige products pose sales-pitch paradoxes. People who fancy such goods _ from perfumes to watches to the latest exotic dog breed _ typically do n't want things just anybody can buy. So, from a merchandizing standpoint, the problem becomes one of satisfying demand enough to stimulate interest but not so much that the product loses the special cachet that scarcity supplies. Moreover, the availability of prestige perfumes is overflowing. Movie stars, from <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> to <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, clothing designers and entertainers have added their own contributions to the gushing stream of new products. A footnote to the recent history of numerous perfume introductions is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debut in March of fragrances by <ORGANIZATION> Bic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of throwaway razor, ballpoint pen and cigarette lighter fame. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON>, who follows the scent business for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, says the lifespan of perfumes is frequently as short as 12 to 24 months. If a fragrance lingers for four years or so, it is considered a franchise from which successful spinoff products can be derived. `` Incredibly saturated'' is how Shore describes the market, adding that it is polarized with ultra high-priced items at one extreme and mass market stuff at the other. Unit sales have fallen for the past five years, he says. Modest growth in sales' value occurred because new fragrances fetch increasingly higher prices. He estimates retail sales rose to $ 3.25 billion in 1988, up from $ 3.15 billion a year earlier. <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> has a simple answer to whether 273 will rise to the top. `` There's always a market for the best,'' he said during an interview while on one of his frequent trips to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. 273 is described as a flowery, fruity, spicy blend of more than 250 ingredients, with the key ones being gardenia, tuberose and jasmine. Its components are expensive and so is its packaging. The crystal, pyramid-shaped bottle is embossed with a 24 karat gold line surrounding the stopper. Bright yellow, reminiscent of the <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> hue and <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON>'s favorite color, and fire-engine red are used for 273, as well as for the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> store. During a conversation, <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON>, who left his native <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1941 and speaks Swiss, French and English, gives the impression he would rather not know the word `` discount'' in any language.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which is asking banks to forgive voluntarily part of the $ 410 billion debt owed by Third World countries, opposes establishing an international agency that could require writing off some of the loans, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was told today. Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, the principal architect of the voluntary debt-forgiveness plan, said such an agency would cause more interruptions in the repayment of loans and interest and further reduce the value of the loans in secondary markets. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year directed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to explore setting up an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Debt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> that could require renegotiation of the loans on more favorable terms to developing countries. Many lenders have been able to get only 40 percent of the loans' face value in selling them to other lenders. `` We have concluded after months of study that debt reduction and debt service reduction can be successfully accomplished in the marketplace,'' <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on international finance and monetary policy `` We believe that -LRB- a -RRB- market-oriented approach ... addresses congressional concerns with less risk to tax-payers'' than a new international agency would, he said. The panel's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md., praised the administration for recognizing the necessity of forgiving some of the debt `` To paraphrase <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, this is not so much the beginning of the end, or even the end of the beginning, but it is perhaps the beginning of the beginning,'' <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that many of the details are likely to be worked out only after individual negotiations begin with some of the major Third World debtors, major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic allies, banks and international institutions. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> unveiled the plan in a speech last Friday in which he conceded that the so-called 1985 Baker Plan, named for his predecessor at <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and now Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, had largely failed in solving the Third World debt crisis. Instead of asking banks to forgive a portion of their loans to impoverished, debt-saddled nations in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan called on them to write new loans for countries willing to make government enterprises private and institute austerity programs. Many countries did, but few new loans were written by private banks. And much of the new money that did come forth from international lending institutions such as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was used by many debtor nations to pay the interest on their loans to private banks. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> suggested <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks could be encouraged to forgive a portion of their loans with guarantees that the World Bank or the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> would provide, if necessary, money to the debtor countries to make interest payments on their remaining balances. `` At least you're moving in the right direction _ decreasing their debt instead of increasing it,'' Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. In outlining the new plan, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said only through voluntary debt and debt-service reduction can some developing countries ever hope to restore their credit worthiness. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not publicly endorse the new plan until Tuesday, raising questions about whether the initiative was <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s alone or had the backing of the full administration. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> acknowledged Wednesday there was some `` confusion'' in the administration, but said his speech outlining the new strategy had been approved in advance by the president. Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lender banks have vigorously resisted efforts by some lawmakers, among them Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, to force them to write off a portion of their Third World debts. `` Across-the-board mandatory solutions are simply not the answer,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, head of debt restructuring at <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. He said imposed debt forgiveness `` would seriously retard'' the ability of Third World debtors to return for new loans. But with riots two weeks ago in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> over austerity programs and radical political movements on both the left and right threatening many fragile Latin democracies, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is now looking at Third World debt as a national security issue as well as an economic one. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks now hold $ 97.7 billion of Third World debt, compared with nearly $ 140 billion six and one-half years ago when the crisis was precipitated by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> stopping interest payments on its debt because of plummeting oil prices. The six largest borrowers _ <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> _ now owe those nine banks some $ 47 billion, less than the $ 65 billion of their combined capital bases.

<TEXT>
 It's been a year since rebellious executives walked out of advertising agency <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to start their own, a split that has left two emotionally scarred rivals and courtroom accusations of business sabotage. Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>'s biggest client, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, took its business elsewhere. A legal dispute on the breakup remains unresolved. Two agencies now use the Lord name in their logos. Moreover, Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> and the new agency, Lord <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> & amp; Partners, combined handle only about 60 percent of the business and employ only about two-thirds as many people as <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> did before the breakup. The saga has drawn attention outside the advertising world because it has raised questions about the impact of executive defections in other service industries such as law and accounting. Some ad agency folks took delight in the courage the breakaway executives showed in leaving, citing a desire for autonomy. But at the same time, they sympathized with those left behind. A marketing consultant who advises advertisers about selecting an ad agency said the lingering legal controversy about the breakup may be frightening some potential clients from considering either agency. `` In making a search for a new agency, a company is looking for a long term, stable relationship, and I think both agencies at the moment are viewed as kind of unstable agencies,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Canter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Achenbaum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, however, insists it has stabilized with billings of $ 50 million and a payroll of 100 people, down from $ 212 million in billings and 320 employees before the breakup. Billings reflect the amount of money advertisers pay for broadcast and published ads. Agencies often get a percentage of billings for their work. Lord <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> said its growth from zero to $ 75 million in billings and 82 employees in its first year makes it one of the fastest growing startups. Of those employed at Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> before the breakup, between 65 and 70 still work there while about 40 are working for Lord <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>. About 210 have gone elsewhere, either because they were laid off or quit. Ad industry analysts say the deep pockets of Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>'s parent, the Britain-based <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, may guarantee its survival <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> is believed to be committed to maintaining <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> as a second ad network separate from <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION>'s other agency, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> Co.. Lord <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> also has a powerful partner, the ad agency <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION>, which holds a 49 percent stake in the new <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> helped found <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1967. Five years later, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> and his partners sold the agency to <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. The agency probably is best-known for its <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> work, especially the campaign that used the <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> `` Little Tramp'' character to show how <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s personal computers can bring order to the most chaotic businesses. Along with <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> was purchased as part of <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s unsolicited $ 566 million acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> JWT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in July 1987. Lord and other top executives of Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> chafed under <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON>'s rule, and after <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> rejected a buyout proposal, they decided to leave. On March 18, 1988, Lord and another Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> founder, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, joined four other Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> executives in the walkout, leaving only a memo to announce their resignations to the people they left behind. The 63-year-old Lord, whose plans to retire at age 64 were put on hold indefinitely with the new agency startup, concedes it was `` a terrible way to do it'' but said his lawyers advised against telling the staff in person. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardell </PERSON>, the only member of the seven-person management committee at Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> who did not defect, recalls hearing a roar build outside his office as copies of the memo were dropped outside each door. He promptly assembled a group to keep the agency running and contacted clients about what had occurred. Within three weeks, Lord <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> hired about 40 people, most of them <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> colleagues who wanted to join their old bosses, and signed ex-Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> clients <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> magazine. <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> sued the defecting managers, accusing them of a conspiracy to sabotage their old agency. The executives denied it. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state court judge barred Lord <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> from signing Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> clients. But as of this past week the judge had not entered a final ruling and had not dealt with the phase of the case in which damages, if any, will be determined. Within a month of the breakaway, <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Wardell </PERSON> as president of Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> and hired two outsiders to help him run the agency, <PERSON> Agi </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of N.W. <PERSON> Ayer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Mather. Ms. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said she was enticed by the challenge of proving wrong `` everybody who thought it was going to fall apart.'' In the next few months, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> II fashions, The Wall Street Journal and a division of <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> left <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>. But <ORGANIZATION> Schieffelin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Somerset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> kept its <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON> cognac there, as did the <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> corporate account. Lord <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, meanwhile, got special projects from <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> with the court's consent and added a $ 30 million account from <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scania </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Both agencies were shut out, however, when <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> took its $ 100 million account to two other agencies in September. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> accounted for about half of Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>'s billings. Eight days after that decision, Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> laid off 90 people, trying to cushion the blow by giving fired employees three months severance pay. Another layoff in December and attrition reduced the work force further. Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> shifted sights to new business. It landed a <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> drug account, <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> home furnishing and <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> telephone operations. Travel, publishing, computers, fashion and financial services are areas Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> is pursuing. Lord <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> reached the breakeven point in January, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said, and is on the hunt for clients in food, travel, fashion and high technology. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said his group had no way of knowing when they left that his old agency would lose clients and have to trim the payroll so much. `` What we left there was a healthy agency,'' <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said. He blames the post-breakup problems on <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON>. But even at that, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said he tries to keep tabs on what has happened to his former employees and said nearly all have found other ad jobs. So how does he feel about having his name on two agency doors? `` I do n't feel any better about it than <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> does,'' <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said. Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> considered changing its name but decided against it. `` Our victory will be all the sweeter with the same name,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the British luxury car maker, said Thursday its 1988 earnings fell 54 percent because <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> results were hurt by the weak dollar. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> car workers voted to accept the company's latest pay offer, ending a strike threat at the Coventry plant, the company said <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> said 4,497 workers approved the two-year pay package, and 3,527 rejected it. The company offered rises of about 4.7 percent in the first year and 4.4 percent in the second, plus bonuses. The workers had threatened weekly one-day strikes and refusal to work overtime. In its earnings report, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> said earnings for the year totaled 28.4 million pounds or $ 48.8 million, equivalent to 27 cents a share, vs. 61.3 million pounds or $ 105 million, equivalent to 58 cents a share, in 1987. Sales rose 7.3 percent to 1.075 billion pounds or $ 1.85 billion, compared with 1.002 billion pounds or $ 1.72 billion a year earlier, bolstered by strong sales in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> said the weak dollar reduced last year's earnings after taxes by about $ 77 million. Plans to offset the impact of a weak dollar in 1988 `` were only partially successful,'' the company said. These plans included increased output and sales, competitive pricing, and higher productivity. Last year, while overall sales rose 8 percent to 51,939 units, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales slipped 9 percent to 20,727 units, and Canadian car sales fell 19 percent to 2,154 units, the company said. The company has reduced its dependence on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. Last year, about 45 percent of sales came from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, compared with 65 percent in 1986. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, sales rose a strong 31 percent, and sales on the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> continent advanced about 20 percent. `` There will be more satisfactory profits in the near future and we'll be able to tackle challenging exchange rates,'' Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said. `` Faced with the difficult hurdle of exchange rates we are doing a competent job,'' <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said. `` But we need to become more efficient and make sure we become as cost-effective as out key competitors.'' <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> did not provide quarterly or half-year results and is not required to under British law.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> says federal law should allow economic considerations to be taken into account in deciding whether to protect species like the northern spotted owl. `` I'm told, on the one hand, that I want to protect an endangered species,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. `` On the other hand, I hear that's going to devastate the entire <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> lumber industry. `` How do we solve that problem? I believe we should be able to take economic considerations into account.'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>'s comments, made in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, came the same day a federal judge refused to delay the sale of timber on as much as 50,000 acres of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> land in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> that is home to the spotted owl. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>'s ruling left forest service plans for protecting the owl in effect pending trial on an effort by environmentalists to preserve even more habitat. Timber companies say the current set-asides are excessive. The forest service is in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, outside <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>'s control. But <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said he expects to receive recommendations May 1 from the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on whether to list the owl as endangered. Such a designation, sought by environmentalists to protect forests in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> from logging, could mean the loss of thousand of jobs in the region, timber industry officials have said. `` Maybe we should change the law'' to consider such economic factors, <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said. He added that `` the spotted owl business is probably the prime example.'' Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., responding to a query on Monday, said a legislative proposal along the lines <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> suggested on Wednesday `` would create a national furor'' and `` turn the rest of the country against you. `` I do n't think such an effort -LRB- to change the Endangered Species Act -RRB- would get anywhere in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Similar views were expressed by Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ore </LOCATION>., whose district leads the nation in the harvest of national forest timber He said log exports rather than environmental laws have caused domestic timber shortages. `` I think there will be a natural, emotional reaction to demand that the spotted owl be exempt from the Endangered Species Act,'' said <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>. `` It's a simple solution _ blame the owl _ but some people are bashing the environment as a smoke screen.'' <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> also rejected a request by the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loggers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to stop the forest service from reducing the allowable timber cut. That issue, too, should be resolved at trial or in negotiations, he said. The judge asked all parties to state by March 29 what should be done to resolve the issue. The suit, filed Feb. 8, claimed the agency's owl management plan failed to set aside enough land to protect the bird. `` I'm really delighted with the decision because it buys us time, which I feel is what we need,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON>. <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, that small mill owners, labor and environmentalists have indicated a willingness to discuss how to maintain a `` sustainable timber industry, as well as achieve some of the environmental objectives.'' <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> True </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, said environmentalists were reviewing their options. `` The biological evidence is that the owl is at the threshold of extinction and that it can not afford to lose additional habitat,'' he said. The forest service plan, approved in December, called for designation of 374,000 acres of mature and old-growth timber in 13 national forests as habitat for what the agency estimates are 2,000 breeding pairs of spotted owls in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> today abolished regulations by which <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has set long-distance rates for more than two decades. The unanimous commission vote, which came after two years of hearings and filings from consumer groups, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the telephone industry, would replace <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's so-called rate-of-return regulations on July 1 with a formula designed to drive rates down and save consumers an estimated $ 900 million over four years. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> described the commission action as `` a major milestone ... in our approach to, our understanding of the regulatory process.'' He said it was time to move on from the rate-of-return process established for the old Bell System in the 1960s. `` We simply can no longer have a regulatory approach that was crafted in the 1960s, to use that system in the 1990s and beyond. It is simply outdated,'' he said. Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said she favored the plan but with some concern, particularly over a provision that would limit how far AT & amp; T could lower its long-distance rates. But she said, `` I do support this grand experiment.'' Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> also said he had concerns about the floors on <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T rates, and said he hoped they could be lifted quickly in future FCC rulings. But he described rate caps as `` a precedent-setting issue that is really going to benefit the public.'' He said the rate cap plan was `` long overdue.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said local telephone companies will not come under the rate cap plan at this point, but that they would be included by July 1, 1990. He said the commission was going to accept further public comment on that issue and asked the local companies to submit plans to use rate caps by May 17. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said he thought he had calmed the waters in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over rate caps, where there has been great concern that residential consumers would not be well-protected, particularly rural telephone users. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> maintains the plan would save consumers $ 900 million by letting <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T establish its interstate prices under a prescribed formula. But the so-called price caps proposal may be derailed in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition ranges from outright hostility to the view that the plan could be salvaged if it included better safeguards for consumers _ particularly rural telephone users. Congressional concern over rate caps, which <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> first proposed in a speech more than two years ago, caused him to postpone a vote on the plan in January. He tried to assuage congressional concerns about consumers this week in a lengthy response to a set of questions from Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, who chairs the communications subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. On the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> side, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., and Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., who chairs the telecommunications and finance subcommittee, have been openly critical of <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee member, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, D-Tenn., introduced legislation earlier this month that would prevent implementation of price caps until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can study the proposal more thoroughly <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said he wanted explicit assurances in the plan that universal telephone service and subsidies for high-cost telephone service in remote areas would be maintained and that long-distance rates would not rise disproportionately in those remote areas. Since the 1960s, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> has been subject to so-called rate-of-return regulation that allows it a certain profit beyond costs. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T can earn about 12 percent above its expenses. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s plan would allow <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> to raise its rates 3 percent less than the rate of inflation _ in effect a 3 percent cut _ with an additional 2 percent reduction for residential and small business users. But if <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T could lower its expenses under such a system, its profits would increase. Rates would be set on three categories, or `` baskets'' of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T service: residential and small business; 800 services; and all other business services. Within the residential-small business basket, prices in the individual categories could not increase by more then 5 percent plus the change in inflation rate. Rep. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, D-Va., said at a hearing last month on the plan that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> should require <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to share with customers half of any windfall profits arising from the plan Another subcommittee member, Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said the revised plan had removed `` floors'' on prices in each of the categories. The plan, as outlined by <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, only would maintain ceilings on how high such prices could go. <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> said that without floors <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T possibly could lower prices far enough to drive out competition, but <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said floors could discourage <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T from increasing efficiency to lower prices. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s plan would cover all dominant interstate carriers. For <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> specificially, it would cap prices for a period of four years. The 3 percent reduction would be imposed after adjustments for cost changes outside of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's control, such as the charges that local phone companies require <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to pay to connnect with the local phone networks.

 Stock prices pushed ahead today, propelled by new evidence of a slackening in economic growth. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.28 to 2,329.82 by noontime on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 739 up, 538 down and 539 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reported that industrial production was unchanged in February from the month before. A separate government report showed a decline of 0.2 percentage points, to 84.3 percent, in capacity utilization of the nation's production facilities Analysts said those figures were read by some traders as evidence of an easing in the strains the economy has been exerting on inflation and interest rates. However, brokers also noted a persistent mood of caution about Friday's impending report on the producer price index for February. A 1 percent increase in the index during January unsettled both the stock and bond markets. A further complication for the immediate market outlook was the `` triple witching hour'' due on Friday, when the last trading occurs in a series of stock-index options and futures. There was talk on the Street that this quarterly phenomenon could produce more volatility than recent similar occasions, since the pace of computer program trading by professionals using these contracts appears to have revived lately. Gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, up \ at 46 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>, up -LCB- at 32 |, and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LRB- at 118 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pacificorp </ORGANIZATION> was actively traded, up -RCB- at 34 -RCB-.

<TEXT>
 Two newspaper-based conglomerates controlled by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> family announced Wednesday they plan to merge operations into a giant media company worth about $ 7.5 billion. The merger is subject to approval by minority shareholders in the two companies, <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organisation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> family controls 61 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes 40 Canadian daily newspapers and 116 dailies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Family members control 73.5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organisation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, with newspaper and other media interests in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The new company to be called <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will have a head office in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and an executive office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, officials said at a news conference. The merged company would have had 1988 sales of $ 4.7 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $ 380 million and net income of $ 436 million. The companies expect to have a detailed proposal within 30 days on how to carry out the merger. Officials said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, who now chairs each company, would be chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and top management would remain. `` The merger will capitalize on the unique strengths of <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> to build a combined organization with even stronger foundations and better future prospects,'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said in a release. Together the companies employ more than 40,000 people, including 5,700 in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. No jobs will be eliminated in the merger, officials said. The merger `` will assure that we can more efficiently pursue further organic growth and acquisitions in both daily newspapers and specialized information and publishing businesses,'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> _ which also has interests in travel and airline businesses _ reported its profit rose 23.8 percent in the year ended Dec. 31. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> reported earnings of $ 229 million for the year on sales of $ 3.74 billion up from a profit of $ 185 million on sales of $ 3.11 billion a year earlier Operating profit was up by 25 percent in the information and publishing segment and 30.4 percent in the leisure travel business.

 The futures industry will ultimately be strengthened if its leaders take a direct approach to issues raised by a federal investigation of commodity trading fraud, the head of the industry's largest trade association said today. `` We ca n't make the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investigation go away; but in the end it will become one of those events in our history which hardens the steel from which we will build the futures industry of the 1990s,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganis </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In his keynote speech at the opening of the group's annual meeting here, <PERSON> Ganis </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> `` is committed to promoting the highest ethical standards within the industry and will support all appropriate actions to protect the interest of the ... customers who rely on these markets. `` Trust is the very cornerstone of our ability to do business,'' <PERSON> Ganis </PERSON> told more than 1,000 brokerage executives, exchange officials and regulators attending the meeting at the posh <ORGANIZATION> Boca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> and Club. The meeting follows by two months the disclosure of an undercover federal probe of suspected fraud at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the world's two largest futures exchanges. No charges have yet been issued in connection with the probe. <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, would not comment on rumors circulating among defense lawyers that six people would soon be charged. The probe is believed to be targeting as many as 100 traders suspected of systematically cheating customers out of millions of dollars while executing their orders on the trading floors of the two <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchanges. Futures are contracts to buy and sell commodities and financial instruments at a specified price on a future date. The investigation has focused attention on certain trading practices that can lead to cheating, critics say. Chief among these is dual trading, the long-established practice among floor brokers of trading for their own accounts and their customers' accounts at the same time. <PERSON> Ganis </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a federal regulatory agency, has asked his association to submit its own analysis of dual trading. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> is seeking similar responses from futures exchanges in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ganis </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based futures brokerage, also said the federal investigation `` calls into question the adequacy'' of self-regulation of the futures industry. Under the existing self-regulatory system, the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> allows individual exchanges to make and administer their own trading rules. <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, who also spoke at the the meeting this morning, said self-regulation had worked well in the past and called for renewed diligence among futures exchanges and brokerage firms in detecting and punishing wrongdoing. `` I know that you have the incentive to root out fraud and abuse in these markets,'' she said. `` So do we and we will continue to be aggressive in this regard.''

 Southern catfish farmers, long unable to penetrate the huge but finicky <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> seafood market, are finally winning over <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> by abandoning the hush puppy approach in favor of lemon-pepper marinade and recipes like catfish and artichoke au gratin. Using a traveling chef to tout nouvelle catfish, the nation's largest processor, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pride </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catfish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Indianola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, says it has tripled sales in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> during the last six months `` Down South, it's catfish, hush puppies, cole slaw and french fries,'' Delta Pride President <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinote </PERSON> said at a recent fish-industry trade show in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` But we know that just does n't go up here. What does go, said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Martel </PERSON>, executive chef at <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>'s Restaurant on <LOCATION> Beacon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, is catfish in lemon-caper beurre blanc `` We've had it on the menu for four months,'' Ms. <PERSON> Martel </PERSON> said. `` At first it was n't really accepted, but now it's selling very well.'' Southern farmers, searching for an alternative to depressed row crops like cotton and soybeans, began raising catfish in shallow, fresh water ponds in the early 1970s. Production has grown at a compound rate of more than 30 percent a year, from fewer than 5 million pounds in 1970 to more than 295 million in 1988, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> figures show. In <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, where 85 percent of the nation's catfish are raised, more than 7,000 people now work in the industry. Retail sales in restaurants and supermarkets, estimated at about $ 10 million in 1970, topped $ 600 million last year. Almost all of those sales, however, were in the South and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Although New Englanders are the nation's largest per capita consumers of seafood, they have long spurned catfish _ a fact that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pride </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and other major processors realize they must reverse if they are to continue their rapid growth. `` People up here still think catfish are the ugly old things that <PERSON> Huck </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> pulled off the bottom of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hinote </PERSON>. `` If we had the image of, say, rainbow trout, we'd be selling billions of pounds, not millions.'' Delta Pride's touring chef, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Folse </PERSON>, is trying to capture that clean, upscale image with recipes like grilled fillet of catfish with dijon mustard, catfish and artichoke au gratin, and cajun catfish with oysters and andouille sausage. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s Country Skillet Catfish division, meanwhile, is breaking into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> market with pre-marinated packs of fish in flavors like cajun, lemon-pepper and mesquite. Two years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pride </ORGANIZATION>, a member-owned cooperative of 188 catfish farmers in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, sold virtually no fish in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Now, it sends two tractor trailers a week to the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area, delivering about $ 60,000 worth of fish at wholesale prices. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s catfish division, based in <LOCATION> Isola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, declined to provide comparable figures. But its Northeast sales manager, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Farr </PERSON>, said sales in the six-state region have doubled in the past year and are `` going up fast.'' Both companies said they have been helped by publicity about diseased flounder and tainted shellfish pulled from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and other polluted <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> waters. `` The thing about catfish is, it's raised in well water and fed on pellets of soybean and corn meal that are certified free of toxins,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Catfish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association in <LOCATION> Belzoni </LOCATION>, Miss. `` With all the concern about ocean pollution, the timing for catfish should be perfect.''

<HEAD>New Board Game Pokes Fun at TV Evangelists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Shenanigans of television evangelists such as <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> have spawned another player in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s multimillion-dollar board game industry, named `` Fleece the Flock.'' The game, scheduled to be in stores next month, is marketed by <ORGANIZATION> Regent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, a Philadelphia-based company that produces board games for some of the nation's largest toy makers, including `` Monopoly,'' `` Clue,'' and `` Sorry'' for <ORGANIZATION> Parker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I came up with the idea when <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was caught in the motel,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, author of `` My Search for the Ghost of Flight 401'' and other books. `` I thought, ` These guys belong on a board game.''' `` Fleece the Flock'' is based loosely on `` Monopoly,'' but instead of real-estate tycoons, players assume the roles of greedy evangelists. Armed with collection plates, players toss dice and seek ownership of theme parks, television stations and record companies while trying to bankrupt their unholy competitors and keep their own sexual escapades secret. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Weston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> collaborated on the game with inventor <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Weston </LOCATION>, whose 30 patents include Masonware microwave cookware, and <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, a humor illustrator whose work has appeared in <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, Fortune and Popular Science magazines. The three formed Tongue-in-Cheek Productions for this venture and sold the rights to market the game to Regent. The company plans to have a pilot run of 10,000 games, selling at $ 25 retail, available by April 1, said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, the Regent account executive who is marketing `` Fleece the Flock.'' The company will focus its sales campaign on the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> at first, but hopes to convince nationwide chains to carry the game, she said. `` Fleece the Flock'' is only the latest board game to capitalize on people in the news. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, maker of the some of the country's most popular games, last month unveiled `` Trump The Game,'' based on the wheeling and dealing of billionaire real estate mogul <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. Analysts say any new entry into the $ 760 million-a-year board-game industry faces an uphill battle. `` More than half the new toys introduced in any given year do not make it past that year's Christmas,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibowitz </PERSON>, a toy industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The success of any new toy item is pretty tough. `` Board games tend to have a more difficult time than many other products because there is a set of rules to be mastered, and the competition is far keener because many people believe they can in fact create a board game.'' Board games face additional difficulties of requiring more than one person and a considerable block of time to play, he said. But <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> and her collaborators say they are confident that Americans' seemingly endless fascination with the foibles of television evangelists will create a niche for their game. `` The No. 1 one thing the American public is interested in right now are TV evangelists gone astray _ not movie stars, not rock stars,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. The three spent five months testing the game on groups of volunteer players, who were observed at <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION>'s product development laboratory in <LOCATION> Weston </LOCATION>. They went through nine versions of the board and even more changes in the rules, which come in the form of the Ten Commandments, before settling on the final version. The inventors were dumbfounded to discover one common trait among the test players: They all were cheating by the end of the game. The phenomenon prompted the inclusion of one rule that is assumed in most games: `` Thou shalt not cheat -LRB- unless thou canst get away with it -RRB-.'' No real-life evangelist is named in the game and the inventors insist they are not attacking religion itself. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> is a Unitarian; <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> are Methodists. `` It's a comment on humanity,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` It's aimed at the human foibles we have, when we'll suppport people like this when we know ... they are evil.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> today abolished regulations by which <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> sets long-distance rates, replacing them with a formula designed to save consumers $ 900 million over four years. However, some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have said the plan, favored by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, could lead to price increases, particularly for consumers in rural areas. The unanimous commission vote will replace <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s so-called rate-of-return regulations on July 1 with a plan that would tie long-distance prices to the rate of inflation. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> described the commission action as `` a major milestone'' in telephone regulation. He said it was time to move on from the rate-of-return process established for the old Bell System in the 1960s. Under that system, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T was allowed to make a set profit beyond its costs, which <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> says provided an incentive for padding costs. `` We simply can no longer have a regulatory approach that was crafted in the 1960s, to use that system in the 1990s and beyond. It is simply outdated,'' he said. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T can earn about 12 percent above its expenses. The new plan willallow it to raise its rates for all customers to 3 percent less than the rate of inflation. An additional 2 percent reduction would be allowed for residential and small business users. For instance, if the inflation rate were 4 percent, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> could raise its long-distance rate 1 percent overall, but residential and small business users would get a 1 percent decrease at that inflation rate. Rates would be set on three categories of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T service: residential and small business, 800 services, and all other business services. Within the residential-small business category, prices of particular services such as night and weekend calling could increase no more than 1 percent a year. Critics of the plan note that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's long-distance rates have decreased 38 percent since divestiture in 1984 due to a reduction in service costs. They say prices will not fall as quickly under the new system as they would under the old one. Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said she supported `` this grand experiment'' of price-cap regulation but had some concern, particularly over a provision that would limit how far AT & amp; T could lower its long-distance rates. Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> also said he was concerned about that feature and hoped it could be eliminated soon. But he described rate caps as `` a precedent-setting issue that is really going to benefit the public.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said local telephone companies will not come under the rate cap plan at this point, but that they would be included by July 1, 1990. He said the commission was going to accept further public comment on that issue and asked the local companies to submit plans to use rate caps by May 17. <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, one of the seven regional companies created in the 1984 breakup of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, said the commission `` took an important step to benefit consumers in a substantial way'' with today's action, but it said savings would have been greater had the commission applied the new rules to local companies this year instead of in 1990. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said he thought he had calmed the waters in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over rate caps, where there has been great concern that residential consumers would not be well-protected, particularly rural telephone users. Congressional concern over rate caps, which <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> first proposed in a speech more than two years ago, caused him to postpone a vote on the plan in January. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, D-Tenn., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications subcommittee, introduced legislation earlier this month to prevent implementation of price caps until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can study the proposal more thoroughly <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said he wanted explicit assurances in the plan that uniervice in remote areas would be maintained and thast telephone service in remote areas would be maintained and that long-distance rates would not rise disproportionately in those remote areas. Rep. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, D-Va., said at a hearing last month on the plan that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> should require <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to share with customers half of any windfall profits arising from the plan <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> bowed to congressional pressure and put in limits on how low rates could go. Without such floors, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T might be able to lower prices enough to drive out competition, the critics said. The 3 percent rate cap would be imposed after adjustments for cost changes outside of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's control, such as the charges that local phone companies require <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to pay to connnect with the local phone networks.

A separate government report showed a decline of 0.2 percentage points, to 84.3 percent, in capacity utilization of the nation's production facilities Analysts said those figures were read by some traders as evidence of an easing in the strains the economy has been exerting on inflation and interest rates. However, brokers also noted a persistent mood of caution about Friday's impending report on the producer price index for February. A 1 percent increase in the index during January unsettled both the stock and bond markets. A further complication for the immediate market outlook was the `` triple witching hour'' due on Friday, when the last trading occurs in a series of stock-index options and futures. There was talk on the Street that this quarterly phenomenon could produce more volatility than recent similar occasions, since the pace of computer program trading by professionals using these contracts appears to have revived lately. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> gained -LCB- to 32 | In its annual report, the company gave an upbeat assessment of its outlook.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest poultry producer in the country, on Thursday sweetened its offer for <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> by more than $ 60 million to total $ 1.11 billion cash. The raised offer, from $ 60 a share to $ 63.50, came a few weeks before <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> shareholders were scheduled to meet to consider a rival deal with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> in a stock swap valued at $ 1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, has been fighting <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s attempted takeover since last fall The company's board said it would consider <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s latest offer `` in due course,'' but asked shareholders not to tender their shares to <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> until the board made a final recommendation. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had earlier told <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>'s board that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> was willing to pay $ 63.50 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> stock. The latest offer, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said, was contingent on termination of the <LOCATION> Holly-ConAgra </LOCATION> deal. The Springdale-based poultry giant already has asked a state court in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> _ where <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated _ to nullify the ConAgra-Holly Farms deal or to hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the proposal. Under the proposal, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> would be able to buy certain <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> assets even if the merger failed. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, also released a letter he sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> board concerning the $ 63.50 offer to <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. `` Obviously this increase should eliminate your continued and erroneous assertions that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> was not, and is not committed to acquiring all outstanding Holly common shares at $ 63.50 per share,'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said. `` Moreover, this represents deliverable real value to your stockholders if _ instead of thwarting a decision on the lock-ups by the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by favoring a <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> transaction _ you would join with us in expeditiously seeking the court's determination.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said its tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> common shares has been extended until March 31. The release said that, as of the close of business Wednesday, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had received tenders of approximately 1.3 million common shares of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>. The target company has about 17.44 million shares outstanding, making the total value of <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION>'s latest offer worth $ 1.11 billion.

 The Chilean foreign minister said today after meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that he is confident a solution can be found to the problems arising after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government warning that citizens should not eat Chilean fruit. `` We are confident that with a joint effort we can have a solution,'' the foreign minister, <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON> told reporters. He described his meeting with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> as `` very constructive'' and said, `` We need an urgent solution today.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, responding to Chilean anger over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government warning, said the action was not taken on political grounds. `` It has been taken strictly as a health and safety measure and we think the foreign minister understands that,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He added that Chilean officials and those from the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> were discussing possible solutions, but did not describe what options were under consideration. A joint statement issued after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> meeting said the two sides agreed to work together on an urgent basis to resolve the problem. The Chilean side expressed deep concern over the country's heavy financial losses, noting that 200,000 workers and their families `` face unemployment and even destitution,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> responded that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry and consumers were being harmed as a consequence of `` the despicable act'' of those responsible for poisoning the fruit. An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the agency weighed economic as well as health concerns when it decided to warn the public about the possible poisoning of Chilean fruit, an agency spokesman said. Such a decision `` has great economic potential'' to harm the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country that exported $ 581 million in fruit worldwide last year and hopes to export $ 850 million worth next year, said spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON>. On the other hand, `` you had a probable confirmation'' that cyanide found in two red seedless grapes from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> `` was a tampering, not a hoax.'' `` Then, how far do you go with a decision based on that evidence? That's very tough,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s decision was to warn consumers not to eat any Chilean fruit _ which includes virtually all fresh grapes sold in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets at this time of year _ and to urge stores to remove all Chilean fruit from their shelves. Supermarkets reacted quickly, and today produce shelves remain empty of Chilean fruit. Many stores have posted signs assuring customers that the fruit on display did n't come from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. At ports in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, tons of Chilean grapes, pears, raspberries, watermelons and other non-citrus fruit were being held under refrigeration while tests on the produce continued. No further contamination has been found, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been meeting through the week with representatives of the Chilean government and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fruit importers to develop a plan that would `` do the least economic damage -LRB- to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> -RRB- and assure the safety of the fruit supply,'' <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s warning to consumers appeared to come some 24 hours after <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors discovered two suspicious-looking red grapes that tests later confirmed to contain traces of cyanide, according to a chronology outlined by <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON>. The chain of events began March 2 when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> received a call from a Spanish-speaking male who threatened to inject cyanide into <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s export fruit. A government source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, has said the caller indicated in his threat that his motive was `` to focus attention on the lower classes of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' The message was passed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which began detaining ships with Chilean fruit at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> learned of the threat late in the afternoon on Friday, March 3, <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON> said. The following day, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> called in a group of <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials to talk about the situation, said <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON>, who attended the meeting that lasted into the evening. Young decided the detention by the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> should continue through the weekend, while he talked to officials at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION>, the Chilean ambassador and fruit importers `` to try to figure out the magnitude of this and grapple with the decision of what to do,'' <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON> said. But by the end of the weekend, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had concluded the threat was a hoax, he said. `` We felt at that point there was no reason for a full detention but that we would do surveillance,'' <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON> said. `` At that point we were prepared to let the fruit through,'' and issued a release about the hoax. A story about the determination that the call had been a hoax appeared in a <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> newspaper, and on March 8, the caller _ `` we assume it was the same guy,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said _ phoned the embassy again and said the threat was not a hoax. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> heightened its inspections at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports, the spokesman said. Most of the fruit enters through the port at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, and there the <LOCATION> Almeria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Star </LOCATION> had just arrived with the next major import from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, he said. It was on that ship that inspectors, making a visual inspection last Sunday, found two discolored grapes that had crystalline rings around puncture marks. The grapes were sent to an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, which made an initial finding that the grapes contained cyanide. They then were sent to another <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> lab in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, which confirmed traces of the poison in the grapes, <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Ad Spending in Newspapers Rose 6.1 Percent in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Spending for newspaper advertising rose 6.1 percent to an estimated $ 31.2 billion in 1988, the smallest percentage gain in 13 years, an industry-backed research organization said Thursday. The increase was down from a 9.0 percent rise in 1987 and was the smallest advance since a 5.0 percent rise in the recession year of 1975. The <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said preliminary estimates indicate spending for retail advertising, the largest category for newspapers, rose 4.0 percent to $ 15.84 billion last year. Classified ad spending rose 10.1 percent to $ 11.77 billion and national ad spending was up 2.6 percent to $ 3.59 billion. Media analysts have blamed the sluggish growth in retail ad spending partly on recent consolidation in the retailing business. They said retailers also were reluctant to boost ad spending in the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash because of uncertainty earlier in the year about how the crash would affect consumer spending patterns. Retail ad spending grew only 1.7 percent in the second quarter of 1988, for instance, but picked up in the last half of the year, rising 4.4 percent in the third quarter and 5.2 percent for the fourth quarter. Overall ad spending in newspapers was up 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter.

 The stock market forged ahead today, propelled by new evidence of a slackening in economic growth. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 17.50 to 2,338.04 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 897 up, 520 down and 508 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reported that industrial production was unchanged in February from the month before. A separate government report showed a decline of 0.2 percentage points, to 84.3 percent, in capacity utilization of the nation's production facilities Analysts said those figures were read by some traders as evidence of an easing in the strains the economy has been exerting on inflation and interest rates. However, brokers also noted a persistent mood of caution about Friday's impending report on the producer price index for February. A 1 percent increase in the index during January unsettled both the stock and bond markets. A further complication for the immediate market outlook was the `` triple witching hour'' due on Friday, when the last trading occurs in a series of stock-index options and futures. There was talk on the Street that this quarterly phenomenon could produce more volatility than recent similar occasions, since the pace of computer program trading by professionals using these contracts appears to have revived lately. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> gained | to 32 -RCB-.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday suspended three units of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from bidding on or receiving federal contracts in the latest action stemming from an investigation of alleged defense contract fraud. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said it was suspending the bidding rights of the Shipboard and <ORGANIZATION> Ground </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, `` to protect the government's interests.'' <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is a computer giant created by the 1986 merger of <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. All three units suspended Thursday were once part of <LOCATION> Sperry </LOCATION> According to latest statistics, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's 15th largest defense contractor, having received $ 1.4 billion in work in fiscal 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s suspension, however, applies to any contract with a federal agency and not just military contracts. Pentagon and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials were unable to say immediately how much business the three divisions did with the federal government. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said Thursday the three suspended units performed about $ 1.6 billion worth of federal government work last year. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> as a whole is a $ 9.9 billion corporation, he said. He added that the suspensions wo n't affect the company's commercial computer sales to the government or industry because those are handled by other units <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON> added <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> was `` confident that by working with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to confirm compliance to rules and by making any additional changes if appropriate, the suspension can be removed rapidly.'' The suspension came less than a week after a former <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> vice president and former <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> consultant pleaded guilty in federal court in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to trying to bribe former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials. Another <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> executive and a second <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> consultant entered guilty pleas on Jan. 27 to making illegal campaign contributions to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The pleas were part of the federal government's 2 -LCB- - year investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 150-billion-a-year procurement practices The probe is code-named `` Operation Ill Wind.'' The probe includes allegations that private consultants, hired by defense contractors, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials to obtain inside information that gave companies an edge in securing contracts. Citing the guilty pleas and a confidential investigative report prepared by <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the suspensions were justified by the `` egregious nature'' of the misconduct. `` The misconduct involves expense account abuses, improper use of consultants for lobbying purposes, improper corporate campaign contributions and bribery of government officials,'' it said. The service, as usual in the case in such disciplinary moves, gave no indication how long the suspensions might last. It did say, however, the management of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> had been vigorous in investigating the allegations and in putting in place a new management program `` to guard against such abuses in the future.'' `` Notwithstanding the actions on the part of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, in light of the number of instances of misconduct at former Sperry divisions; the egregious nature of the misconduct, and the fact that new instances of wrongdoing pertaining to the ongoing ` Ill Wind' investigation continue to surface, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has determined that the former <LOCATION> Sperry </LOCATION> divisions need to be suspended to protect the government's interests,'' the service said `` Evidence that the policies and procedures of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> are understood and followed by these divisions is necessary, and <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> must perform some additional internal audits across the affected divisions to verify that the types of improper conduct in evidence ... are not pervasive elsewhere within the company,'' it said.

 Spring break has arrived and college kids are rolling out the barrels. But <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the world's largest brewery, is urging restraint The company spends millions of dollars each year promoting what it calls `` responsible-drinking'' programs. Some are considered particularly relevant this time of the year, when students descend upon resort cities from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> and indulge in brew-guzzling marathons that are n't particularly welcomed by the locals. Entertainer <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> for the past 10 months, said his city's residents have long tried to curb the level of alcohol consumption during spring break. `` A couple of the events are cruising and drinking and getting out of hand,'' <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> said. `` For the locals, it's a time we dread.'' Enter <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>, which tries to get its message across before the students hit town. On campuses across the country, college newspapers advertise `` Pit Stops'' where students en route to spring break destinations can pull over and get a doughnut and a cup of coffee. `` Here it's someone selling alcohol and saying ` Do n't abuse it and do n't get carried away,''' <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> said. `` I like it.'' The <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-based </LOCATION> brewing giant says it is committed to keeping customers from over indulging. The number of responsible-drinking programs sponsored by the company nearly equals the number of its brands. Choices include Budweiser, <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON>, <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>, Natural Light, Michelob, Michelob Dry and <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> To keep thirsty drinkers in line, the company offers programs such as the Your Alcohol IQ videotape, Know When to Say When, The Buddy System, <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sport </ORGANIZATION>, TIPS, I'm Driving, and Alert Cab <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> sold 78.5 million barrels of beer last year, 41.1 percent of the total brewing industry sales nationwide. But for more than a decade, the brewery has n't been content to simply sell beer in record quantities. According to a recent <ORGANIZATION> Fortune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> survey, <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> ranks first among beverage companies in responsibility to the community and environment. `` I do n't know if social conscience is the right word,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambright </PERSON>, vice president and group executive at <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>, who oversees the company's responsible-drinking programs. `` It's a social commitment. We hope to be part of the solution. Hopefully, what we're doing is something that's more than just a PR piece.'' At first glance, <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>'s sobriety theme in the spring break pilgrimage south by winter-weary college kids might have the unwanted side effect of forfeiting part of this lucrative market. But it appears far more successful than the sophomoric partying theme by rival <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> recently scrapped what it now concedes was a poor-taste ad campaign for spring-break getaways after college students complained it was sexist and they threatened to boycott <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> products The brewer's supplements in college newspapers last month featured pictures of bikini clad coeds clutching <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> bottles and tips for men on `` sure fire ways to scam babes.'' <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> does n't have anything as easy as a barrel count to determine the success of its responsible drinking program. <PERSON> Lambright </PERSON>, however, pointed out that the number of underaged beer drinkers and fatalities in alcohol-related accidents both have decreased in recent years. `` We certainly do n't have all of the answers, but the statistics are all moving in the right direction,'' <PERSON> Lambright </PERSON> said. `` The system is getting better.'' Among the company's programs, and advertisements touting them: _ At sports events, messages from professional athletes are beamed on the big screen, and billboards remind the fans to be a `` Good Sport'' and not over indulge. _ At local video stores, <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law stars <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> are featured in the brewery's newest program, `` Your Alcohol IQ.'' <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> distributed 25,000 free copies to video outlets nationwide. _ And who has n't seen Spuds <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> and the Spudettes advising television watchers to moderate their alcohol intake? The concept of a beer company advising restraint in the consumption of its products is n't all that new anymore. <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> says its first programs began in the late 1970s. But the brewery did n't go high-profile until 1985, when its first advertisement for responsible drinking aired. Role models such as sports stars <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> were hired to tell the public to `` Know When to Say When,'' a program that provides guidelines for bartenders, waiters and waitresses. `` They were n't beer commercials by any means,'' <PERSON> Lambright </PERSON> said. `` Prior to that, most of what you saw were third-party efforts in the public-service announcement mode as opposed to a company actually paying for regular price commercial time to run a non-beer commercial responsibility piece.'' Collectively, <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy for fighting alcohol abuse is `` Operation ALERT,'' an acronym for Action and Leadership through Education, Responsibility and Training. The array of programs designed as aids for the estimated 80 million beer drinkers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> runs the gamut. There's <ORGANIZATION> T.I.P.S. </ORGANIZATION>, which stands for Training for Intervention Procedures by <ORGANIZATION> Servers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION>, an instruction manual to teach retailers how to recognize and avoid troublesome situations involving alcohol. And Good Sport, a campaign aimed at combatting rowdyism in stadiums and arenas. The Buddy System is designed for use with college-age audiences. It recommends holding parties with a dry last hour, and establishing a network of friends to serve as designated drivers. Alert Cab, a program in 140 cities, provides a free taxicab ride home for customers in bars and restaurants who are faced with possible drunk driving situations. I'm Driving is another designated-driver program. <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> also is a major sponsor of SADD, Students Against Drunk Driving, and has published pamphlets dealing with the effects of alcohol consumption on motorcycle and boating safety.

<HEAD>National Semiconductor Loses $81 Million In Third Quarter From Cont.
Ops.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has shed one division, agreed to sell another and laid off 2,000 workers to stem losses, announced Thursday it lost $ 81 million from continuing operations in its most recent quarter. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, said the company's chip business was hurt by a decline in bookings in late 1988 caused by a buildup of customers' inventory, a slowdown in computer sales and seasonal factors. He said he expects improvement in the current quarter following a restructuring of the chip division, cutbacks in the worldwide workforce and reduced spending. The chipmaker's losses for the first nine months of its fiscal year through February 26 reached $ 116.8 million from continuing operations, compared with a $ 34.6 million gain during the same period a year earlier. In the third quarter last year, the company had a gain of $ 13.4 million from continuing operations. Net losses of $ 44.6 million in the quarter and $ 100.3 million in the nine-month period were cushioned by a $ 45.1 million gain from the sale of National's <ORGANIZATION> Datachecker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. That division, though, lost $ 8.8 million in the quarter and $ 28.6 million in the first three quarters Net sales were $ 589 million for the quarter, up from $ 572 million a year earlier. For the first nine months this year, sales were $ 1.8 billion, up from $ 1.6 billion a year earlier. `` The size of the loss does n't shock me, but it was larger than I anticipated,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammons </PERSON>, a computer industry analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` I do n't know that it's going to hurt them any more on Wall Street. Nobody expected them to do very well this quarter.'' National Semiconductor's chances of recovering much in the fourth quarter are slim, <PERSON> Hammons </PERSON> said, and would depend on how well they market products and use the cash from their recent sales of divisions. `` They have some new products coming out that could help them, but I do n't think they'll be ready to help in this quarter,'' he said. On Feb. 27, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> announced it had agreed to sell its <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> for $ 398 million to <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. National Semiconductor expects to close the sale during the current quarter National Advanced Systems is <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION>'s largest distributor of mainframe computers that run the same programs as <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s big mainframes. It has 2,200 employees worldwide, including 1,200 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. After that sale, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> would be pared down to about 35,000 worldwide. The company announced 2,000 layoffs earlier this year.

 The stock market extended its recent rally today, propelled by new evidence of a slackening in economic growth. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reported that industrial production was unchanged in February from the month before. A separate government report showed a decline of 0.2 percentage points, to 84.3 percent, in capacity utilization of the nation's production facilities Analysts said those figures were read by some traders as evidence of an easing in the strains the economy has been exerting on inflation and interest rates. However, brokers also noted a persistent mood of caution about Friday's impending report on the producer price index for February. A 1 percent increase in the index during January unsettled both the stock and bond markets. A further complication for the immediate market outlook was the `` triple witching hour'' due on Friday, when the last trading occurs in a series of stock-index options and futures. There was talk on the Street that this quarterly phenomenon could produce more volatility than recent similar occasions, since the pace of computer program trading by professionals using these contracts appears to have revived lately.

 The dollar finished mixed in domestic dealings Thursday after rising in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> despite central bank intervention. Gold prices declined. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 388.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from Wednesday's late bid of $ 391.10. Traders agreed much of the activity centered around the Japanese yen. Before easing, the dollar had reached a high in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading of about 131.30 yen, a level not seen since last October. But traders said the move reflected more weakness in the yen than strength in the dollar. `` It was sort of a new level, but what happened was that there was selling of the yen, more so than a buying of dollars,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, a vice president at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Eastern's Rivals Raising Fares on Competitive Routes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some rivals of strike-torn <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> have raised fares on competitive routes since the 13-day-old walkout began, moves they say stem from higher demand but that one consumer group complains is price gouging. Some competitors said Thursday that their recent fare hikes were unrelated to the Eastern strike, which has grounded most of the airline's flights. The walkout by Machinists has been supported by most of the pilots and flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which sought bankruptcy protection from its creditors about a week ago. All the airlines are heading into the peak spring travel period combining Spring Break and the Easter and Passover holidays. Eastern archrival <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> says it has n't raised fares but has tightened fare restrictions as a result of the Eastern debacle. On flights from cities in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> to </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where it competes with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> has boosted its cancellation penalty on discount fares to 100 percent from 25 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> took the action because the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> strike had led many passengers to book on multiple carriers including <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> _ creating `` no shows'' for those airlines, said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pate </PERSON>. In addition, she said, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> has reduced the number of cut-rate fares available on certain flights `` to protect business travelers.'' The spillover from the Eastern walkout meant that discount-fare passengers were displacing full-fare business fliers on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flights, Ms. <PERSON> Pate </PERSON> said. Other Eastern competitors _ notably <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ confirmed they recently raised fares on some routes they share with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. Those moves were called `` opportunistic'' and `` gouging'' by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, consumer affairs director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passengers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he was skeptical about the insistence by <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> that their fare boosts were unrelated to the strike and were not an attempt to capitalize on Eastern's woes. `` You would hope they would be more sensitive during these unusual circumstances,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The possible disappearance of Eastern from the skies likely would reduce the number of discounted fares available to passengers, he said. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which also compete with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> on some routes, said those carriers had not raised fares since the Eastern walkout started March 4. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> plans to increase its discount fares between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, starting March 23 in order to bring them closer to <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fares, which are sharply higher, said <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Blattner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. He called the timing of the move a `` coincidence.'' The round-trip discount fares between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> will be raised from $ 239 - $ 259 to $ 259 - $ <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s discount <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Miami </ORGANIZATION> fares, which have n't been increased, range from $ 258 to $ 298. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said that carrier `` has not raised any fares as a result of the Eastern strike.'' Rather, he said, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s recent increases were an extension of a move begun last November. The latest hikes include a rise in the regular one-way fare between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to $ 329 from $ 319, also effective March 23. The <LOCATION> Boston-Tampa </LOCATION> route competes directly with Eastern. <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> declined to give examples of other new fare increases applied to non-competing routes. `` These people are businessmen and they've seen an opportunity to raise fares,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, an airline analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and others have argued that a demise of Eastern could seriously reduce competition in the nation's airline industry, whose ranks have been thinned by deregulation. They have warned the reduced competition could lead to higher fares, defeating the intended main purpose of deregulation _ to make it affordable for more Americans to fly.

 <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will issue refunds to about 687,000 consumers across the country as part of a $ 16 million price-fixing settlement agreed to this week, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said Wednesday.

 The stock market climbed to a six-week high Thursday, propelled by new evidence of a slackening in economic growth. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 20.17 to 2,340.71, its highest close since it stood at 2,343.21 on Feb. 8. The day before that the average hit a post-crash high of 2,347.14. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 939 up, 523 down and 501 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reached 196.04 million shares, up from 167.07 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 237.09 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reported that industrial production was unchanged in February from the month before. A separate government report showed a decline of 0.2 percentage points, to 84.3 percent, in capacity utilization of the nation's production facilities Analysts said those figures were read by some traders as evidence of an easing in the strains the economy has been exerting on inflation and interest rates. That provided some hope for signs of improvement in Friday's impending report on the producer price index for February A 1 percent increase in the index during January unsettled both the stock and bond markets. A complication for the immediate market outlook was the `` triple witching hour'' due on Friday, when the last trading occurs in a series of stock-index options and futures. There was talk on the Street that this quarterly phenomenon could produce more volatility than recent similar occasions, since the pace of computer program trading by professionals using these contracts appears to have revived lately.

<HEAD>FCC Ends Old Rules, Says Consumers Should Save Under New System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday abolished two-decades-old price regulations on <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s long-distance services, saying consumers should reap $ 900 million in savings under a new pricing plan over the next four years. One consumer group, however, said the plan could lead to the first increases in long-distance rates, particularly on nights and weekends, since the 1984 breakup of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T. The 3-0 commission decision, which <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> called a milestone in federal telephone regulation, will replace <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s so-called rate-of-return rules on July 1 with a plan that would tie long-distance prices to productivity gains and the rate of inflation. The vote, postponed in January under pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, followed more than two years of rancorous debate between <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> and critics on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and consumer groups who said the new plan may slow the 4-year-old decline in long-distance rates. But <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said it was time to change the 1960s-era system under which <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T was allowed to make a set profit beyond its costs. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said that system gave <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T incentive to pad expenses. `` We simply can no longer have a regulatory approach that was crafted in the 1960s and to use that system in the 1990s and beyond. It is simply outdated,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said the decision was `` a step forward for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and good news for our customers.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> made a number of revisions to the plan to assuage congressional concerns, including additional safeguards for residential and small-business users. One of <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s critics was Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on telecommunications and finance <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said the plan `` still does not contain sufficient consumer safeguards to ensure that residential telephone customers will fairly share in rate reductions which should result from new telephone technologies. I fear that the days of real long-distance price reductions for the average residential caller may be over.'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said he will co-sponsor legislation requiring the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to provide price and cost data with which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can measure the effect of price caps on consumers and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's competitors. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T can earn about 12 percent on its investment. Under the new plan, overall rates must rise 3 percentage points less than the rate of inflation _ for example, a 1 percent increase if the rate of inflation were 4 percent. Rates would be set on three broad categories of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T service: residential and small business; 800 services; and all other business services. To make sure big business does not get all the benefit of rate cuts, rates for residential and small-business prices must rise at least 2 percentage points less than the rate of inflation, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said. Within the residential-small business category, prices of particular services such as night and weekend calling could increase no more than 4 percentage points above the overall percentage change in rates. For example, if inflation was 4 percent and overall rates rose 1 percent, night and weekend calls could rise 5 percent. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has lowered long-distance rates faster under rate-of-return regulation and that the new plan is `` hardly an improvement for the public'' since long-distance rates conceivably could go up in some categories. `` It will possibly give you the first real long-distance increases since the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T,'' <PERSON> Kimmelman </PERSON> said. The plan also limits how much <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T can lower its rates, which commissioners <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said caused them concern. But <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said she supported `` this grand experiment'' of price-cap regulation. <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> said he reluctantly supported the limits, or floors, on how much prices can go down and that he hoped such restraints could be removed quickly. But he said the plan overall was a `` precedent-setting issue that is really going to benefit the public.'' <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` mystified that the commission finds it necessary to continue treating <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T differently by limiting our ability to reduce prices in such an extremely competitive market.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said local telephone companies will be placed under some kind of rate cap plan on July 1, 1990. The commission ordered local companies to submit pricing plans in that regard by May 17. Although state utilities commissions regulate phone companies' local rates, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> regulates how much the companies charge long-distance carriers to plug into their local networks Those access charges account for a big part of long-distance costs. <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, one of the seven regional companies created in the 1984 breakup of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, said the commission `` took an important step to benefit consumers in a substantial way'' but that savings would have been greater had the commission applied the new rules to local companies this year. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's chief competitors in the long-distance market, said it supported the price cap plan for long-distance carriers but said local phone companies should still be strictly regulated because they have monopolies on local service. But <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sodolski </PERSON> said: `` For the full benefit of price caps to be realized, local exchange carriers must be free to employ it as well.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, D-Tenn., introduced legislation earlier this month to prevent implementation of price caps until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can study the proposal more thoroughly <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said he wanted explicit assurances in the plan that universal telephone service and subsidies for high-cost telephone service in remote areas would be maintained and that long-distance rates would not rise disproportionately in those remote areas.

<HEAD>Fruit Fallout: Poisoning Menaces $900 Million Import Business</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The poisoning of grapes from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> poses a high-profile threat to a business that has grown to $ 900 million a year by using <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> farmers to put fruit on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tables all winter. American importers and Chilean farmers worry that if the cyanide sabotage case is n't solved soon, they could lose the market for the 25 percent of their crop still on trees or aboard U.S.-bound ships. The tampering, which prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to recommend pulling grapes, nectarines, pears and other Chilean winter fruit from market shelves, also might give the business a permanent public relations black eye, one big importer said. `` I think it's a major, major, overreaction ... an entire industry is being destroyed,'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> importer <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastes </PERSON> said Tuesday. Eastes, manager for the <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer-California </PERSON> import firm munched a couple of red flame seedless grapes from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> for reporters Tuesday to underscore his anger over the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s no-sell recommendation. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> advised grocers to pull Chilean fruit from the shelves Tuesday after tests in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> found cyanide _ at far below harmful levels _ had apparently been put in two clusters of grapes. Virtually all the so-called summer fruit on American grocery shelves this time of year is from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, whose farmers have learned to exploit the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> growing season that is a mirror image of that in the north. From a trickle of grape imports in the 1950's, the business has grown to projected shipments this year with a retail value of $ 900 million, said <PERSON> Caryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> spokeswoman for the industry. In 1979, when imports were starting to gain momentum, the retail value of Chilean grapes and stone fruit was $ 72 million, said Ms. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>. By 1988, that had climbed to $ 600 million. More than 100 ships full of Chilean fruit are expected to land this year, to be distributed nationwide from the ports of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The business is organized by the growers, under the banner of the <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and the importers, called the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Produce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. That loose alliance carefully orchestrates the traffic to avoid ruffling the feathers of American farmers.: Grapes, which make up three-quarters of the shipments, are carefully withheld until the last <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> emperor grapes clear the supermarkets, usually sometime in December. Grape shipments are cut off _ earlier than would be decreed by nature _ in late April when the first <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> grapes make their way to market. There is little overlap in growing season for nectarines and other fruit, so there is less potential for conflict with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> growers, Ms. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said. Importers and growers are anxious for the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to declare the fruit safe, because products already on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shores is will deteriorate beyond salvation in a week or two, Ms. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said. Additionally, an estimated 25 percent of the crop remains on the trees and vines of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s farms, or on ships headed north. Importer Eastes called the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s advice to quit selling Chilean fruit unnecessary and maintained that testing here and new security measures imposed at packing houses in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> adequately protect American consumers. He suggested the agency was trying to burnish an image tarnished in the public mind by the current furor over Alar, a possibly carcinogenic chemical sprayed on a fraction of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apple crop. Fruits imported from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> include grapes, nectarines, peaches, plums, apricots, pears, <PERSON> Granny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> apples, cherries, raspberries, blueberries, cantaloupe and honeydew melons.

 A savings and loan trade association on Wednesday canceled its annual convention in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> this year, thus avoiding television images of S & amp; L executives lolling on palm-fringed beaches at a time when the industry is asking for the biggest taxpayer bailout in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. `` It would not be appropriate for us to hold a convention in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration are working to find a solution to this terrible crisis facing taxpayers,'' <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement. The council, the smaller of two main trade groups representing S & amp; Ls, is taking a lesson from its larger rival, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. The league held its convention in November at a luxury hotel on <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. It said it went ahead with the meeting because it had been planned years in advance and would have been costly to cancel at the last minute. Nevertheless, the group endured criticism after television news reports showed executives on the beach and attending a lavish luau. The council said would it would suffer `` substantial financial costs'' by canceling its meeting, which had been scheduled for May on the island of <LOCATION> Kauai </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, `` Thrifts who are members of the national council ... have concluded that it would be wrong to conduct business as usual.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan for bailing out the savings and loan deposit insurance fund would spend about $ 150 billion over the next 10 years. Most analysts say at least half of that would come from taxpayers. That exceeds the combined costs of the Marshall Plan aid to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after World War II and the bailouts of the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the council may schedule a special meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in May to elect officers and take care of other business normally conducted at the annual convention In another development, one of three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the agency regulating S & amp; Ls, announced his resignation effective Aug. 18. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, appointed to the board on Nov. 12, 1986, is returning to teach at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s school of business. Under the president's proposed <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L plan, the bank board would be reduced to a single chairman, who would report to the treasury secretary.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial operating rate eased last month for the first time since September, the government said Thursday in a report welcomed by those worried that strains on the economy are pushing up prices. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities operated at 84.3 percent of capacity in February, down 0.2 percentage point from January, when the 84.5 percent rate was the highest in nearly a decade, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported. At the same time, the pace of industrial production held steady in February after 12 months of steady advances, the central bank said in a second report Thursday. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told reporters the figures are `` consistent with the notion of some moderation in the economy'' although it would be premature to say they signal a trend. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 20.17 points. Traders took the reports as evidence that inflationary pressures in the economy were easing but analysts were cautious about reading too much into one month's figures. `` The markets can take some comfort that the edge is coming off the burst of momentum through the end of the year in the economy,'' said economist <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. But he continued, `` There is no suggestion ... that the softness spells recession or even major slowdown at this time, nor that it will flow through and arrest the upward momentum of inflation.'' The closer factories get to full capacity, the greater the fear they will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. Just Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reported that while expansion and improved efficiency `` are forestalling widespread bottlenecks, materials and product prices are edging up, albeit sporadically and at an uneven pace.'' Concern about inflation heightened last month after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in January while wholesale prices shot up 1 percent. That prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to intensify its year-long campaign to push up interest rates in an effort to slow economic growth and thus restrain inflation. Economist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Annable </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> said that while the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can `` breath a sigh of relief'' at February's industrial production and capacity use reports, there are other, more convincing indications that the economy continues to expand at a moderately strong pace. `` What we've got in this economy is continued movement forward,'' <PERSON> Annable </PERSON> said. `` The news for financial markets is good but in fact it certainly does n't mean that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is going to ease off.'' Last month's operating rate of 84.3 percent was up from 82.4 percent a year earlier. At manufacturing plants, the operating rate dipped 0.2 percentage point to 84.6 percent. Use of capacity for production of durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years, stood at 83.4 percent, down from 83.5 percent in January. The rate for non-durable goods was 86.3 percent in February, down from 86.7 percent in January. The rate at motor vehicle and parts plants was down 1.2 percentage points to 84.9 percent last month. It was the second straight monthly decrease after steady advances from August to December. The auto industry has been plagued by slow sales so far this year, as higher interest rates and declining demand set in. The operating rate at utilities rebounded to 82.9 percent in February, up 1.4 percentage point from January when activity was depressed by relatively warm weather. In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the operating rate also fell 1.4 percentage point to 81.1 percent in February, as coal production continued to fall from its high level at the end of last year. Production, meanwhile, held steady in the manufacturing sector in February after a 0.7 percent gain in January. Automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.2 million units last month, down from the 7.5 million pace of January. Output at mines and oil wells dropped 1.8 percent in February after falling 1.9 percent in January. Production at utilities rose 1.9 percent, after dropping 0.5 percent during the unusually mild temperatures of January.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended March 6, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,084.2 billion from a revised $ 3,076.5 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,950.7 billion from a revised $ 3,941.7 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 791.5 billion from a revised $ 788.8 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in M3. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,069.4 billion, a 3.0 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,927.3 billion, up 4.4 percent, while M1 rose 1.2 percent to an average of $ 788.1 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 459 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 793 million a day the week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said net free reserves totaled $ 362 million in the two weeks ended March 8, down from a revised $ 656 million in the two weeks ended Feb. 22 _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 287.7 billion in the two-week period ended March 8, up from $ 287.4 billion two weeks earlier

 Long-struggling <ORGANIZATION> Maxicare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> filed a federal bankruptcy petition Thursday but promised to keep serving the 1 million Americans covered by its plans in a dozen states. The company, which operates health maintenance organizations under the names <ORGANIZATION> Maxicare </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> HealthCare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> HealthAmerica </ORGANIZATION>, announced it sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code. <ORGANIZATION> Maxicare </ORGANIZATION> promised to keep serving patients, and to continue paying doctors and hospitals. The filing, made in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, gives the company a reprieve from creditors and allows it to continue operating under court supervision while seeking to reorganize. Included in the filing are the Los Angeles-based parent company and operations in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Excluded is the company's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> HMO. <ORGANIZATION> Maxicare </ORGANIZATION>, once the nation's biggest private HMO, has been losing money for two years, and in recent months has cut membership from 2.3 million to 1 million by selling several health plans in 14 states. In announcing the bankruptcy, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratican </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, revealed the company was negotiating sale of its <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> plan, previously said to be part of the solid `` core'' the company intended to retain. <PERSON> Ratican </PERSON> said in a news release the company filed for bankruptcy because it could n't pay its bills. `` These actions enable us to protect our operations while gaining the time to finalize and implement a plan for reorganization,'' <PERSON> Ratican </PERSON> said. `` We acted in the face of increasing demands by creditors and our inability at this time to obtain additional financing.'' <ORGANIZATION> Maxicare </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, which sold for as much as $ 28 a share in the company's boom years a decade ago, closed at 18.75 cents a share Thursday, down 50 cents from Wednesday's close. <ORGANIZATION> Maxicare </ORGANIZATION>, saddled with debt, hit along with the rest of the HMO business with soaring medical costs, and struggling to overcome the effects of an ambitious expansion drive, has logged losses in eight straight quarters. In the first nine months of 1988, the company lost $ 250.5 million. Final 1988 results have n't been reported. Debt as of December included $ 150 million in bank loans and $ 295 million in bonds. <ORGANIZATION> Maxicare </ORGANIZATION>'s health plans are structured in the form of health maintenance organizations, under which customers, generally enrolled through their employers, are entitled to visit designated doctors, generally for a small fee. Doctors are paid on a set monthly budget rather than being reimbursed for specific services. The intent is to cut the overall cost of medical care by encouraging people to get regular checkups and preventive treatment, rather than waiting to seek treatment until a medical crisis strikes. <ORGANIZATION> Maxicare </ORGANIZATION> does n't own hospitals or clinics, as do some HMOs, so its assets consist primarily of a management team and `` good will,'' or its image with customers. Founded in 1973 by the husband-and-wife team of Chairman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Maxicare </ORGANIZATION> grew quickly, capitalizing on the industry's belief that HMOs were the wave of the future. Easily raising money through stock sale and loans, the company grew into a national health plan. By the mid-1980s, HMOs were under pressure from rising medical costs. But Maxicare bit off a big chunk of new business in 1986 by buying two ailing competitors, <ORGANIZATION> HealthCare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> HealthAmerica </ORGANIZATION>. The strain of trying to digest the acquisitions was compounded by management's inability to keep costs and the number of doctor visits down, said analyst <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, who follows the company for the L.H. Friend & amp; Co.. Inc. investment firm in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Founder <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> were ousted in August 1988 and replaced with <PERSON> Ratican </PERSON>, an outside director with a background in the entertainment business, most recently as president of ailing <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laurentiis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which now is in Chapter 11. But he has so far been unable to reverse the slide. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ratican </PERSON>, by reassuring investors the firm could work its way out of the hole, has done plan members a disservice. `` You've got a situation where a layman has an opportunity to switch plans ... and he reads in the paper ` This company's in good shape,' he continues his enrollment,'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said. The bankruptcy filing comes at a critical time for the company's hopes at resurrection because workers generally are given the opportunity to switch medical plans each June, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> noted Competing medical plans already have started marketing themselves among employees, and the filing is likely to both distract <ORGANIZATION> Maxicare </ORGANIZATION>'s management from that marketing effort

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Soar on Chinese Buy-Swap Rumor, Technical Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Sugar futures prices surged to their highest levels in nine months Thursday amid rumors that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had come into possession of as much as 500,000 tons of sugar. `` What you saw was a market catching fire,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` And the real excitement is the possible growing participation in the markets of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ the world's most populous nation.'' On other markets, energy futures were mixed to marginally higher after three straight sessions of strong rallies; gold and silver futures dipped, but platinum rose; and livestock and pork futures edged lower. Sugar settled 10 cents to 51 cents higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION>, Sugar and <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with the contract for delivery in May at 12.59 cents a pound. Buying began with a rumor that the Chinese had bought between 150,000 and 500,000 tons of raw sugar from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, though many traders cast doubts that the shipment exceeded 350,000 tons. Many others traders said they believed the Chinese actually bought the sugar last fall from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and, learning the Soviets had made a similar-sized purchase from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, simply swapped shipments to take advantage of economies in delivery of the sugar. Also fueling the market was talk the Brazilians had sold 100,000 tons and that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> was in the market for a large shipment. The climbing prices triggered a string of technical buy-stops _ decisions made by price-chart considerations _ and the market broke a `` quadruple top'' at 12.38 cents and continued rising. Energy futures, which hit a 16-month high Monday and soared again in successive sessions, were mixed. Crude oil highlighted the complex, losing 5 cents at the opening on profit-taking, and recovering gradually in light trading. Crude oil settled 2 cents lower to 9 cents higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with April at $ 19.84 a barrel; heating oil was .02 cent to .36 cent lower, with April at 53.83 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .50 cent lower to .12 cent higher, with April at 55.83 cents a gallon. Reports of cuts by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC producers, as well as problems with production facilities in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> had fueled previous rallies. Gold and silver continued sliding in the face of a firm dollar and uncertainty about whether higher inflation is in the offing. Platinum got a boost from apparent trade-house buying prompted either by ideas the market was oversold or by recent sales by the Japanese. Gold settled $ 2.30 to $ 2.90 lower at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with March at $ 389.80 a troy ounce; silver slipped 3.2 cents to 4.7 cents, with March at $ 6.059 a troy ounce. Platinum was $ 7.20 to $ 7.70 higher, with April at $ 545.50 a troy ounce. Livestock and pork futures mostly were lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Volume was light as traders, many expecting a bearish tone, remained on the sideline in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s cattle-on-feedlot report issued after the close Live cattle were .37 cent lower to .02 cent higher, with April at 77.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent to .35 cent higher, with March at 80.60 cents a pound; live hogs were .50 cent lower to .10 cent higher, with April at 43.17 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to 1 cent lower; with March at 37.15 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed in light, quiet trading Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat settled \ cent lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher, with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.37 a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to -RCB- cents higher, with March at $ 2.78 a bushel; oats were \ to 1 -RCB- cents higher, with March at $ 2.08 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher, with March at $ 7.67 -LCB- a bushel.

 A high-level Chilean delegation called Thursday for `` swift action'' to avoid further economic and social turmoil in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> resulting from the suspension on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of Chilean fruit over an apparent cyanide poisoning attempt. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were meeting with representatives of the Chilean government and its fruit growers, trying to find a way to release for sale the tons of Chilean fruit detained at American docks without compromising public safety. The Chilean call was disclosed in a joint communique issued after Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> met with the Chilean foreign affairs and agriculture ministers. As Chilean fruit continued to pile up at airports and docks and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Chileans were threatened, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said a small team of <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors will be sent to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> on Saturday to check security on Chilean fruit. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> meeting came four days after the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> warned Americans to avoid Chilean fruit because traces of cynadide were found in Chilean fruit shipped to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. There was no sign of an imminent end to the crisis despite the high-level attention it was receiving. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said technical meetings were continuing to determine what levels of inspections might be feasible for fruit at American docks. A government source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said there had been discussion of inspections of 8 percent to 10 percent of the fruit on the docks now and in the future, and release the produce if no contamination is found. However, `` it does n't appear to be feasible to do that high a level now.'' For the future, Chilean officials are proposing to inspect visually about 4 percent to 5 percent of their fruit before it is shipped for export, the source said. `` We're getting reasonably close on that -LRB- <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s -RRB- end of things on something that might be acceptable, but the problem of what to do with what's on the ships and in warehouses is still up in the air,'' the source said. The fruit that's been removed from store shelves `` is such a different problem they may just end up with no solution to that except to dump it,'' the source said. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimates about $ 20 million worth of fruit is detained, under refrigeration, at docks and airports in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, about $ 4 million worth is to arrive in the next few days by ship, and $ 15 million worth is ready to be shipped from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Inspectors at ports in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> have examined 6,859 cases of grapes and nearly nearly 4,000 cases of other fruits: honeydew melons, nectarines, apples, raspberries, pears, cantalopes, plums, peaches, seedless watermelon, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> Canary Melons and blackberries. The joint communique issued at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> stressed the determination of both sides to reach a solution. Chilean Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting that he is confident a solution will be found and described the encounter as `` very constructive.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, responding to Chilean anger over a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government warning that citizens not eat Chilean fruit, said the action was taken strictly as a health and safety measure. `` We think the foreign minister understands that,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Aders </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the entire food industry will be hurt by the discovery of cyanide in Chilean produce and cancer-causing chemicals in apples. `` The loss will probably be felt throughout the system,'' he said. Chilean produce continues to arrive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and Aders noted one shipment reached <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Wednesday night. `` The indication is they're not going to let it be sold,'' he said. Aders predicted surveillance of imported fruit will increase, saying, `` I expect that there'll be a lot more activity at the dock, including vigilance at the point of shipment.'' But security will continue to be a problem. `` The whole food system is based on the integrity of the people in it,'' he said. `` Suddenly it's an attractive place for criminals to go to express a grievance.''

 Three former <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executives were charged Thursday with conspiring to defraud the federal government, five months after the defense contractor agreed to plead guilty to fraud and pay a $ 115 million fine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said the indictments `` demonstrate that the federal government will not waver from employing the resources necessary to protect the integrity of the defense procurement process.'' The indictments are part of an ongoing three-year investigation of the Rockford-based defense contractor. <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty in October to fraud charges in a four-count criminal information. The $ 115 million fine was the largest fraud settlement in <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> history. The aerospace manufacturer allegedly overbilled the government for aircraft parts; underbid actual costs on other contracts and attempted to recover through overhead accounts set up for other purposes; and submitted claims for such things as babysitting expenses and country club memberships. <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernam </PERSON> said the company was not involved in Thursday's indictments. He declined further comment. The three men were identified as <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, a former division controller; <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a former division pricing manager; and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamann </PERSON>, 63, of <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, a former pricing group supervisor. They were charged with one count each of conspiring to defraud and scheming to conceal. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was charged with two counts of making false statements, and Chapel and <PERSON> Hamann </PERSON> with four counts of the same offense. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and $ 1 million in fines; <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hamann </PERSON> face 30-year terms and $ 1.5 million in fines if convicted. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clabault </PERSON> did not say what role the three allegedly played in the fraud scheme involving <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION>. He declined to say whether the men acted on company orders or have agreed to cooperate. After the settlement was approved last fall, <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> was suspended from bidding on or receiving government contracts until a grand jury concluded its probe. On Jan. 26, <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> agreed to repay an additional $ 62.3 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and make cost-saving concessions on future contracts one defense official estimated could be worth another $ 34 million.
