 Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, returned Monday from a five-day visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> that he said may have provided a `` tiny nudge'' toward improved relations. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>'s trip included a three-hour meeting with <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who he said is eager to resume normal diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, a Democrat, said he probably would report on the trip to Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> when the two meet Wednesday. `` I think we may have given it a tiny nudge,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said in a telephone interview after his arrival at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I think some little improvements could be made, and out of those little improvements, big improvements could follow.'' He refused to cite specifics, but when pressed said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> `` both need to pull in our horns a little bit and -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should -RRB- tone down <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> and not start TV Marti.'' Radio Marti aims American government-generated programming into <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Pell </ORGANIZATION> aide said that during the senator's discussion with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader was very angry about plans to expand <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> to a television service and claimed that was one of the major stumbling blocks to diplomatic relations. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said he doubted much could be done to stop the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's plans to launch the TV service. The senator said he suggested to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> that releasing four political prisoners remaining from the revolution in which <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> came to power would be a good first step to improve relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. ` I do n't want to be too optimistic about that. I certainly did n't come back with any firm agreements,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said It was <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>'s third trip to the island and his first since 1974. He said the change in presidents in this country and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s recent agreement to pull its troops out of the African nation of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> provide a window to improve relations. `` Peace seems to be breaking out in all parts of the world. There is no reason it can not break out in that little corner of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 An ancient bronze vessel that was to be auctioned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had been stolen in June from a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> museum, an official report said Monday. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> office notified its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterpart Saturday of the theft, and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police met Monday with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official to ask the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's help in recovering it. The ritual vessel, called a dui, was to be auctioned at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said A Sotheby's spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigman </PERSON>, said the auction house withdrew the vessel from its Tuesday sale of `` Fine Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art'' at least two weeks ago. He said <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s was holding it pending a resolution of the dispute between the owner and the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Weigman </PERSON> said the owner had requested anonymity and that <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s withdrew the artifact after receiving a description of the missing museum piece from a representative of the Chinese government The vessel was made during <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Warring States Period, from 475 B.C. to 221 B.C., a period of conflict among rival princes before what is now northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was unified under the first emperor. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the vessel and 226 other Chinese antiques have been on display at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> since Thursday, but <PERSON> Weigman </PERSON> said the vessel was not publicly displayed. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police identified the dui from a color photograph in a Sotheby's catalog, which did not identify the owner and said it was expected to sell for $ 60,000 to $ 80,000. Chinese police say the dui in the catalog is identical in shape, decoration and patina spots to one that was stolen June 4 from the Qu Yuan Museum in <LOCATION> Zigui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> province. The thieves were never caught. The dui was excavated in the county in 1983. An expert at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Palace Museum said craftsmen at the time the piece was made were unable to cast identical bronze pieces. Millions of dollars worth of artifacts are smuggled out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> each year, mostly through <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Some are stolen from museums, but most are discovered by peasants in their fields or by tomb robbers, and the sites are wrecked before archaeologists can study them. <PERSON> Weigman </PERSON> said an auction `` would actually be the worst possible place'' to dispose of a stolen object because the process _ which includes the publication of photographs and detailed descriptions of every item _ is so public.

 An alleged drug dealer on Monday became the first witness in the <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> murder trial to claim to have witnessed <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> hit his illegally adopted 6-year-old girl. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> whacked the girl for no apparent reason while she was asleep in <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON>'s arms on Oct. 23, 1987, while they were driving in a car. Demonstrating the blow, <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> slammed the back of his hand against the bench of the trial judge, state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON>. The judge, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and the jurors seemed startled. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, is on trial for murder in the beating of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, whom he illegally obtained from a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> teen-ager. He smiled and shook his head as if in disbelief at Scannapieco's dramatic gesture. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> denies that he hit the child. He says she fell unconscious after choking on food she had thrown up the night of Nov. 1, 1987, and that he caused bruises on her chest and back while trying to revive her. His former live-in lover, <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, who was dropped as a defendant and is scheduled to testify against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, also filed a $ 3 million civil lawsuit that was served Monday on <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. The lawsuit alleges that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> used humiliation, brainwashing, drugs, and the withholding of food to teach <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> that `` she was a worthless person who could only be saved through his wisdom and special powers.'' Scannapieco, indicted on federal narcotics charges, said he and <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> were driving together because he had hired <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> to represent him at his arraignment in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> the following morning, Oct. 24, 1987. The witness said the child was cold in the car and he allowed her to snuggle against his chest for warmth. After 10 to 15 minutes she fell asleep. `` Right after she fell asleep,'' <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> said, `` right out of the clear blue sky, Mr. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> took his hand and went ... -LRB- demonstrating the blow -RRB- SMASH!'' <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> said the slap was `` enough to bring tears to your eyes,'' but `` she did n't show any reaction whatsoever'' except to open her eyes and look at <LOCATION> Steinberg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told him he hit the child because she sometimes slowed her heart and her breathing, putting herself into a near coma. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON>'s brother-in-law, <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Koncelik </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, testified he saw <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> drop <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> about three feet to the ground, telling her, `` You're heavy.'' <PERSON> Koncelik </PERSON>, a supervisor in a sheet metal factory in Coxsackie, said the incident was Oct. 24, 1987, in his grassy backyard. He said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was unhurt. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was removed unconscious from <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s apartment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Nov. 2, 1987. She died three days later at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> injuries </ORGANIZATION>, according to testimony.

<HEAD>Agency Says The Blind Need Not Apply</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, after a decade of accepting foreign service job applications from blind people, has ruled that diplomacy is not a suitable profession for them. The decision was a disappointment to <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON>, who has passed five <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> entrance examinations since 1985 and has other credentials that normally would make him an ideal candidate for a diplomatic career. `` I am absolutely outraged,'' <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON> said in a telephone interview after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> informed him that blind people no longer will be permitted to take entrance examinations in <LOCATION> Braille </LOCATION> or to use outside help. `` It is absolutely unconscionable that the rest of the government has shown itself to be able to employ blind people constructively,'' <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is still in the 19th century.'' <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> with degrees in Spanish and French and has a master's degree in business administration from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. Born in what is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> 46 years ago, he has been blind since age 8. He lived for 15 years in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and six months each in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and he speaks with the elegantly phrased formulations of a man accustomed to intellectual pursuits. He has his own consulting business, helping disabled people find employment. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials agree that they had been following a contradictory policy toward the blind, allowing them to take the written and oral examinations but never accepting them as foreign service officers. The officials, insisting on anonymity, said a department task force ruled recently that blind candidates must demonstrate an ability to work with original documents `` effectively and independently.'' That meant <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON> would not be provided with any materials in <LOCATION> Braille </LOCATION> for an admissions test, that a reader would not be provided for him and he could not bring his own reader with him. <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON> had been taking _ and passing _ <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> written and oral examinations since December 1985. He said his score on his written tests had improved each time. He was informed of the rule change earlier this month shortly before he was to take another `` oral assessment'' test. The officials said the policy of rejecting blind applicants after allowing them to take admission tests was not as cynical as it might seem. They said blind applicants were routinely advised that permission for them to take admission tests did not mean that medical standards requiring `` visual acuity'' for all diplomats would be relaxed. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> view is that all foreign service officers must be `` worldwide available'' and that a blind person can not be expected to deal with the myriad demands diplomats face. One official said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has facilities for helping the blind overcome their handicap but that most foreign countries lack such accommodations. Another said that much of diplomacy involves reading the `` body language'' of foreign envoys during diplomatic discussions. Such gestures as winks and nods form part of the overall message a diplomat must assimilate, the official said. <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON> said the blind are no less able than sighted people to read other people's language, be it `` silent or verbal.'' Accepting a blind person for diplomatic service `` would be a terribly unfair thing to do to that individual,'' said another official, who cited high risk posts, such as <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, as particularly inappropriate for a sightless person. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials commented only on condition their names not be used. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jernigan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blind </ORGANIZATION>, has little patience with such arguments. `` Everybody says it's wonderful what blind people can do so long as they work somewhere else,'' <PERSON> Jernigan </PERSON> said from his office in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. He said dealing with reading material is the principal activity of diplomats and blind people are capable of handling `` mountains of paperwork.'' Beyond that, he said, the blind require no more secretarial help than sighted persons. <PERSON> Jernigan </PERSON> added that the federation is prepared to take the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to court but he hopes that course can be avoided. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gashel </PERSON>, director of government affairs for the federation, said federal law requires that all government and government-assisted programs conduct their employment practices without discrimination on the basis of handicap. The blind and other disabled persons, he said, must be provided with `` reasonable accommodation'' to help them overcome their handicap. But, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wants a general exemption from this law because of the unique circumstances under which diplomats must work. He said the last time a blind person threatened court action against the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the basis of discrimination, the agency decided on an out of court settlement worth $ 165,000 to the complainant. His account could not be confirmed by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials.

<HEAD>Pentagon Plans Incentives To Hold On To Military Doctors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, struggling to keep military doctors from quitting for better money elsewhere, soon will establish a hefty bonus system under which some surgeons could earn $ 112,250 a year while in uniform. Under the program, which takes effect Jan. 1, physicians with critical skills now in short supply _ such as surgeons _ can boost their salaries by up to $ 20,000 a year if they agree to re-enlist for four years. Smaller `` retention bonuses'' will be paid to physicians who re-enlist for two or three years. A surgeon who signs up for another four-year hitch under the program would see his total monetary compensation rise from roughly $ 92,250 a year to $ 112,250 a year. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> believe we have spotted a problem here in time to do something about it,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhall </PERSON>, the No. 2 executive in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s health affairs office. `` There are other severe non-salary problems that contribute to the loss of military physicians, but this is a key start.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized the new bonus program in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal 1989 budget authorization and earmarked $ 30 million for the effort as long as the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> meets certain requirements The most important was a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by Nov. 15 comparing military and civilian salaries along with a plan for divvying up the money among different types of physicians. Another report focusing on military health professionals other than doctors is due by Dec. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Newhall </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> met the Nov. 15 deadline for the first report and will meet the deadline for the second. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official declined to release the first report, but a copy of the 25-page document was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from other sources. The report concluded that the new bonus program authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is desperately needed because the last major overhaul of military physician salaries occurred in 1980. During the intervening years, it said, inflation has totaled 35 percent and the net income of civilian doctors has climbed 47 percent. In some specialties, such as heart surgery, the difference between military and civilian pay now exceeds 100 percent. `` The result is a general loss of buying power for all military physicians, and a significant loss of competitive compensation for certain highly paid specialists,'' the report states. The report said that while losses of experienced physicians were widespread, the most critical shortages were among doctors with specialty skills. `` The lure of readily attainable, significantly higher pay is an attractive incentive for military physicians to leave the service at the completion of their obligated service,'' the report said. `` In a 12-month period commencing in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lost 76 percent of its trained specialists completing their initial training obligation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it would use the money authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pay annual bonuses ranging from $ 20,000 down to $ 1,500 in exchange for re-enlistment contracts. The various medical specialties have been divided into seven groups for calculating the bonuses, based on where `` the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is suffering the worst shortages,'' the report said. The top group includes only two specialties: surgery and orthopedics. The second tier will include anesthesiology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology and urology. The third group covers radiology and obstetrics-gynecology.

 The near-collapse of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s largest industrial conglomerate, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> federation </ORGANIZATION>, has forced a rethinking of the pioneering socialism on which the nation's economy was built. <ORGANIZATION> Koor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, with annual sales of more than $ 2 billion, controls 150 firms and employs 27,000 people making products ranging from high-technology electronics to tires, fruit juice and refrigerators. <ORGANIZATION> Koor </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 250 million last year. In October, it defaulted on a $ 20 million loan from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and the bank demanded its liquidation. Like the successful plan by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Koor </ORGANIZATION> is trying to stave off bankruptcy with a government bailout and a court-backed reorganization plan. But <ORGANIZATION> Koor </ORGANIZATION>'s problems are symptomatic of the growing financial ills that have afflicted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s economy. Even the kibbutzim, the communal farms that were the backbone of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s pioneering ideal of sharing work and profits, are in serious financial trouble. The <ORGANIZATION> Kibbutz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> announced last week that its members were struggling to pay off $ 4 billion in debt. The economic shakes have prompted increasing calls for a more capitalistic, free enterprise system. `` The economy has suffocated,'' <PERSON> Stef </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, a wealthy businessman, wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s tradition of `` work as a source of employment rather than a source of profits'' has failed, <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> wrote. `` The only way to save <ORGANIZATION> Koor </ORGANIZATION> is to turn it into a private enterprise.'' Even <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which controls the <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION> and founded the socialized economy, says he favors selling off some state-owned companies. The Histadrut and state-owned companies account for up to 40 percent of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s $ 35 billion gross domestic product, economic analysts say. Reducing such concentration could take years, said <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Refua </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the state-owned firms. The authority has launched a program to `` privatize'' many state enterprises within five years. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s socialized economy began even before the state was formed in 1948. Jewish immigrants, most from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where Marxist philosophy was taking hold, arrived early this century with the idea that collectively they could build enterprises and recycle profits to create more jobs. They started in construction, and their early cooperatives grew into <PERSON> Solel </PERSON> <PERSON> Boneh </PERSON>, now the nation's largest contracting firm. `` Histadrut did start as a trade union, but with no state it soon became apparent that it had to create employers to create jobs,'' said <PERSON> Efran </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON>, an economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The Histadrut, which has 2.5 million members in the nation of 4.2 million, represents 80 percent of the labor force. It employs 160,000 people in its companies. When the state was founded, extensive government involvement was needed to build roads, water systems and other infrastructure. `` It was necessary to build a country,'' <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON> said. The first steps toward more free enterprise came in 1977, when the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> came to power and passed reforms that dismantled exchange rate controls and removed some trade barriers. But high inflation in the mid-1980s forced <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s backing, to reimpose financial restraints Economists argue that some of the crisis today is a result of a program that began in 1985 to stabilize the economy. The program has squeezed profits by raising interest rates and other production costs while freezing the exchange rate at 1.6 new shekels to the dollar. Most, however, acknowledge inefficiency and mismanagement. `` We feel that if there is no reason the government needs to own something, it should go,'' said <PERSON> Refua </PERSON>. The government reduced its corporate holdings this year with the sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Paz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 97 million. Stock has been sold in three other companies, and a study sets out a five-year plan to sell or reduce ownership in 24 other firms. If carried through, the government will control enterprises responsible for just 15 percent of current production by state companies, <PERSON> Refua </PERSON> said. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Koor </ORGANIZATION> court reorganization plan, the conglomerate can become profitable again only with extensive pruning. It has proposed selling $ 130 million in assets and dismissing 6,000 employees through 1990. Such moves are unprecedented in a country where workers believe they have a right to a job and unemployment has been held to about 6 percent despite recent economic austerity. But Histadrut economist <PERSON> Roby </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON> said it must be done. `` Even if these difficult steps are not in accordance with the historical and philosophical ideas of Histadrut, we have to try and save the healthy parts,'' <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON> said. `` If we do n't do it, we take the risk of losing everything.''

 When the 55 Democratic senators meet Tuesday to select a new leader, one of the things they'll be looking to improve is the supposedly poor `` quality of life'' in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Do n't count on it, says the outgoing majority leader, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Addressing complaints from some senators that, under his leadership, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> met too often and too long into the night, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> responded: `` I believe first in the quality of work. We ca n't operate on a punch-the-clock basis. I did that once when I was a welder in a shipyard.'' At age 71, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> is winding up 12 years as a leader of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, including six years as majority leader. His replacement will be elected in a secret vote by the 55 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators who will take their place in the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next January. Senators being courted for their votes often tell the three candidates they want a leader who will improve the quality of life in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. By that, they mean fewer long evening sessions and erratic schedules that often keep younger men away from their families and Western state senators away from their home bases. `` A majority leader does n't have many options,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` He has the responsibility to get a legislative program in action and to meet the needs of the nation. One ca n't adjust the needs of the nation to one's comfort. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, displaying a 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> calendar, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> met for 137 days this year. `` That's a quality of life that's not too bad. I do n't know how much one can improve on that,'' he said. The three who would try are <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. There's no predicting how the voting will go in the secret balloting. `` I think no one, candidates included, has the faintest idea who's winning,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., who has previously spoken of the need to improve the `` quality of life. <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> is the oldest and most experienced <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate. At age 64, he has served in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since 1962, on the Watergate committee during the collapse of the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration and most recently as co-chairman of the Iran-Contra investigating committee. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, 56 and a three-term senator, has been pushing hard for the job for years and tried briefly to unseat <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> in 1986. Since Election Day, he's achieved near frequent-flyer status, making the rounds of television news shows to demonstrate his ability to speak for the party. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 55, a former federal judge with eight years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, also is regarded as a strong candidate among those senators looking for a new spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which now has <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> at the top despite ongoing ethics investigations into his financial dealings. The balloting Tuesday will be held in a locked room in the Capitol. A simple majority is needed to win, and if no one can claim that after the first ballot, the one with the least votes drops out and the voting begins anew. Republicans also will be electing their leader Tuesday, but <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> has no opposition and is almost certain to return for his third two-year term as <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader.

<HEAD>Bush Urged To Let States Take Lead On Education</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should reduce the federal role in public education and let states take the lead because `` states can best respond to the unique needs of their citizens,'' a conservative group says. The <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, in a book to be released next month, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could increase state responsibility for education by `` removing federal oversight authority from federal money for specific programs, and instead, giving solid amounts of money to states to distribute as they see fit.'' The conservative think tank said federal strings `` need to be detached to restore parental authority and involvement to the nation's public schools.'' It recommended that parents be given a choice as to where their students go to school. `` By stimulating competition, schools will be immediately forced to improve or suffer the consequences,'' the report said. `` Vouchers and tuition tax credits empower the parent, as do state and community-sponsored open enrollment plans for public schools of choice.'' The recommendations, written by <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimberling </PERSON>, a former assistant secretary of education, are contained in a chapter of the book `` Mandate for Leadership III: Policy Strategies for the 1980s.'' The book, copies of which have been distributed to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition team, is the third in a series of policy guides published by the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The first, published after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was elected in 1980, was considered a blueprint for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. In the chapter on education in the latest book, <PERSON> Kimberling </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should urge <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to create tax-free savings accounts to help low-and middle-income families meet future college costs, and allow tax deductions for businesses that pay their employees' college tuition to improve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness Ultimately, the new savings accounts might reduce demand for direct federal student aid and `` significantly increase the pool of private savings,'' he said. <PERSON> Kimberling </PERSON> also urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to consolidate all federal education programs, currently spread throughout several agencies, within the Education Department and to give the education secretary `` more authority for planning and coordinating education programs throughout government.'' The secretary should use his position as the top education policymaker to `` bring to light problems and solutions for education reform,'' and use its resources to help states and communities improve education programs, he said. The book says the biggest education policy disappointment of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` was its failure to keep or even seriously pursue its election campaign vow to abolish the -LRB- Education -RRB- Department.''

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has ruled <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for almost 60 years, is fighting to retain its grip even as its presidential candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, prepares to be sworn in. To overcome public discontent, internal party divisions and newly aggressive opposition, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> will have to strike quickly on both the economic and political fronts after he takes office Thursday. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> is in a battle to modernize the country ... and itself,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON>, the party's international communications director. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, as it is known for its Spanish initials, has ruled with few challenges since its founding in 1929, interlocked with the government in a system that allowed its tentacles to reach every nook and cranny of society. It turned out the vote and channeled favors, including high-level jobs, and in many places succumbed to corruption. It also brought decades of stability and expansion to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, but its power has been shaken by a continuing economic crisis that has cut the average Mexican's earning power by 50 percent since 1980. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> scraped by in the July 6 presidential election with just over 50 percent of the vote. `` In the past 48 years there has not been a transfer of the federal executive power in a political crisis like this,'' wrote <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON>, leader of a reform movement within the party, in a recent front-page column in the newspaper Excelsior. Still, the party remains powerful, taking sweeping victories in municipal elections in several provinces since October. Despite accusations of fraud most of the wins are recognized as genuine. For almost 60 years the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s pillars _ labor, peasants and a catchall of bureaucrats, teachers and others _ have wheeled and dealed, sharing leadership, power and the rewards of power. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> was a type of cushion between the political power and the citizens,'' said <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and a labor specialist. Election victories were taken for granted and ensured, if an opposition candidate or apathy stood in the way, by fraud and campaigns that could depend on access to state funds, vehicles and employees. With transition from a largely illiterate rural population to an urban society came a political awakening, a desire for more competitive elections and an end to corruption. In response, <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> governments gave more opportunities, including congressional seats, to the small opposition parties. Adding to the discontent was the jolt of an economic crisis brought on by the oil boom and bust. Outgoing President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s six-year term has been a period of austerity for most Mexicans. On July 6, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> was stung with its narrowest federal election win ever, setting three firsts. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won with a scant 50.36 percent of the vote, the first time the party got less than 70 percent of the vote. It gave up <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats, four of the 64, for the first time. And it had to settle for 260 of the 500 seats in the lower house, the first time it failed to gain a two-thirds majority needed for constitutional reforms. The opposition _ both the conservatives and the left _ charged electoral fraud and that <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' victory was n't legitimate. `` Society changed. It's not the apolitical society of 20 years ago,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrido </PERSON>, who has written one history of the party and is working on another. Many opponents were former <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> members, such as leftist presidential candidate <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, who felt they'd been dealt out of the circle of power during de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s conservative administration, which introduced free market economic policies and attempted to reduce government subsidies. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who will be the 13th consecutive <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> president, has pledged greater democracy and changes to make the party more responsive to the needs of the people. `` Our purpose is to modernize so as to retain our majority position, and so as not to be weakened and exhausted by parliamentary coalitions, which always end up by succumbing to the rule of the minorities,'' he said in a campaign speech. Even the attempt to open up the party meets tough opposition from what are known as the party's `` dinosaurs,'' the still-powerful old guard. Labor, traditionally the sector that could be relied upon to get out the vote and maintain stability, in part in exchange for public offices, is a foundation of that old guard. Before the economic crisis, `` unions could negotiate more or less satisfactory salaries'' because they were part of the system, <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> said. But now, he said, `` there is n't enough for more salaries or to maintain employment levels. It means there are more protests.'' More than 20 labor candidates lost in the July 6 election. Recent violent incidents, including a shootout between rival unions in the lobby of one of the city's most luxurious hotels, showed either defiance of de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> or loss of control by top labor bosses, analysts said.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the past decade, seven <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations pried themselves loose from the dictatorial grip of military men. The march of freedom seemed inexorable. For the 210 million people in the seven nations _ <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> _ the return of elected civilian government brought substantial personal freedom and the restoration of human rights. Now the bright, shining shield of democracy is becoming tarnished. Growing disenchantment is evident in several countries, mostly because of dashed expectations that an end to political repression would bring economic improvement. It has n't proved that simple. Nonetheless, democracy continues to enjoy substantial allure, spreading into the few remaining enclaves of authoritarian rule. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s citizenry, rallying behind the slogan `` the joy is coming,'' voted to end Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s 15-year tenure as president and hold elections in December, 1989. Only tiny <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, run by aging, authoritarian <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> since 1954, remains totally outside the <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> fold. And despite the occasional rattling of sabers, and a few dramatic but isolated and abortive barracks revolts in some countries, few observers feel a military coup is likely anywhere on the continent. `` When you have inflation of 1,000 percent a year, you obviously get unhappy people, but that does n't mean they're inviting a return to military rule,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON>, a politics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Princton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and an expert on the Latin American armed forces. `` The military does n't have a solution to these problems,'' he said in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the 1960s they thought they had the answers. They do n't think they do today. `` The notion that somehow they could do it better has been disproved by their own experience.'' In most South American countries economic mismanagement or corruption by the politically inexperienced armed forces contributed to the return of civilian rule. But some of the new civilian governments have not proven much more adept at handling the continent's most urgent, and persistent, problem: grinding poverty. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is considered the most volatile example. The inflation rate is expected to surpass 1,000 percent, the economy is stagnant and little if any headway has been made in improving the plight of a hungry peasantry that feeds the ranks of a Maoist guerrilla organization, the Shining Path. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was considered one of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s new generation of charismatic leaders when he took power in 1985. But his popularity has plummeted because of what critics see as a vacillating economic policy, especially since he alienated conservative parties and businessman with a plan to nationalize foreign banks in 1987. A recent survey by a Lima-based polling firm, <ORGANIZATION> Datum </ORGANIZATION>, found that 60 percent of Peruvians do n't believe a military coup is likely before <PERSON> Garica </PERSON>'s term ends in 1990. But 28 percent do _ a sign that democracy's foundations are less than rock-solid. `` If our problems continue to degenerate and if our institutions continue demonstrating ineffectiveness, the totalitarian temptation will visit us sooner or later,'' said a Peruvian political analyst, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasara </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> also are plagued by economic and social instability, with sky-high inflation rates and tens of thousands of workers striking daily for better pay, paralyzing many basic services such as transportation and the mail. Brazilian newspapers publish regular reports of government corruption, nepotism and waste. Retired Gen. <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueiredo </PERSON>, the last in a series of military presidents who ruled from 1964 to 1985, told citizens to `` forget me'' when he handed over power to a civilian. Now he says he is besieged by supporters asking him to return to office. A popular bumper sticker in bustling <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> wistfully recalls military rule: `` I was happy and I did n't know it.'' President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, another charismatic symbol of democracy's return when he assumed office in 1983, was shouted down by hecklers during a recent speech and his <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> trails the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in popularity as the nation prepares for elections in May. But such open expressions of dissent and dissatisfaction reflect perhaps the most attractive aspect of life under the new democracies. Freedom of expression and action has been a pledge kept by the new governments. Most labor strikes take place unchallenged and the mass media suffers few if any restrictions. The systematic arrest, torture and killing of dissidents that took place when troops kept order under military rule has been replaced by respect for basic civil and human rights.

 Participation in party politics, labor federations and other social groups both pro- and anti-government is active and broad-based across the continent. The problem, according to some analysts, is that such groups often work at cross-purposes. `` The primary problem in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s democratic reconstruction is the capacity to stabilize the political system,'' said the Chilean political scientist <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Somavia </PERSON>. `` And the capacity to stabilize the political system depends on achieving basic accords among political parties and the different social sectors.'' Until a country achieves a working, stable political system `` the possibility of a coup will remain present,'' said <PERSON> Somavia </PERSON>. He is president of a Latin American study group sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanism </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Somavia </PERSON> cited <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> as an example of a new democracy where `` political arrangement is basically working.'' Under <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, who took office in 1985 and is considered one of the most widely respected new presidents, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s political, labor and business groups have reached a basic understanding that has provided stability and economic improvement. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> also is often cited as a democratic success story. President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> has overseen an economic austerity program that slashed annual inflation from an astounding 20,000 percent to about 10 percent. The Bolivian reforms were painful and politically risky, with thousands of workers at unprofitable state-run mines laid off and new taxes imposed. But the government's predictions of stability and growth are slowly coming true and, as Bolivians prepare for new presidential elections in May, no one considers a coup even remotely possible in what traditionally has been <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most political unstable country. Not that the military has n't made its presence felt. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Siles </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON>, was kidnapped by police and military officers in 1984 but freed hours later because of a vast public and official outcry. In <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazzos </PERSON> of the air force led two short-lived revolts in 1986 before the government arrested him. A year later, his followers abducted President <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> and held him for 11 hours, freeing him only after an amnesty was granted to the rebellious <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazzos </PERSON>. Two brief but dramatic garrison revolts in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, in 1987 and 1988, were defused when President <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> agreed to limit human rights trials of soldiers. In each crisis, it is widely accepted that the civilian governments emerged strengthened. And although military rumblings persist, experts contend there is a new, less threatening tenor. `` The saber-rattling is now related to issues that directly affect the armed forces as an institution,'' such as human rights trials and military spending, said <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON>. He said they no longer are taking public issue with general government policy, or presenting themselves in the role of national saviors as they did in the 1960s. <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> said he does not subscribe to the notion of an inevitable political cycle of military and civilian rule. `` The pendulum has stopped swinging,'' he said. According to <PERSON> Somavia </PERSON>, the military also lacks the broad-based civilian support for a takeover they enjoyed during the social turmoil that affected many <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries two decades ago. `` They have less social force,'' he said. `` No one is asking for a coup.'' But <PERSON> Somavia </PERSON> called the antagonistic relations between the military and civilians `` a central problem that is going to be with us for a very long time.'' Re-establishing a constructive relationship in which the armed forces fully accept civilian control `` is something you ca n't accomplish in one government.''

 A monthlong spate of incidents involving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces has touched a raw nerve in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, provoking outraged newspaper editorials and a sharp protest from the government. On <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, the southern island where 35,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops jostle for training space with 1.2 million Japanese residents, civilians complain that houses were hit by bullets in October and two tear-gas canisters exploded at a nightclub Nov. 19. The canisters sent scores of people into the street, coughing and choking. The tear-gas incident, which <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> authorities said was under investigation, came one day after the abrupt transfer of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> skipper. His ship had embarrassed the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> command by firing practice shells that hit about 1,000 feet from a Japanese coast guard vessel. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> immediately expressed regret for the shelling, which occurred in Japanese waters near the entrance to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on Nov. 9, but the Japanese government reacted strongly. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> lodged a protest with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, while several major newspapers published blistering editorials. The <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> daily called the shelling `` the result of the unbelievably slack discipline and lack of moral concepts of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' Said the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>: `` It would definitely be risky if things of this sort were left as they are. Even a single miscalculation would endanger human life. Besides, it would gravely affect the ties of genuine friendship that exist between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' About 64,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> under a security treaty that obliges the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help defend this country, with an added major role in security for northeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The treaty also obliges <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to provide the bases and training areas needed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. The vast majority of the Japanese support the U.S.-Japan security treaty and the country's anti-war constitution, which give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a prime role in defending <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But this country never was occupied by foreign troops until its defeat in World War II, and Japanese are sensitive to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence. Leftists demonstrate against visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships that may be carrying nuclear arms, and the public reacts strongly when a dangerous accident involves <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces or when the bases appear to be encroaching on Japanese life. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> wants to build more than 800 apartments but faces resistance from the neighboring town of <LOCATION> Zushi </LOCATION>, which has repeatedly elected a mayor who opposes taking forest land for the military housing. On <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, prefectural Gov. <PERSON> Junji </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishime </PERSON> has blamed a string of troubles on `` something wanting in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's chain of command or a decline of discipline.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commanders on the southern island are reportedly reviewing safety measures following a forest fire that occurred in a training area in October and the discovery about the same time that a residential area near a Marine Corps firing range had been hit by bullets even though firing on the range is supposed to be in the opposite direction. Two Foreign Ministry officials went to <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> on Thursday to meet with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> generals, inspect the firing ranges and talk to local officials. Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Yoshifumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> said the local people's attitude was a `` crucial element in the presence of the bases'' and was important to the wider issue of U.S.-Japan security relations Okinawans also have asked that some land now in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases be returned to civilian use for the growth of the island's tourist industry. About 20 percent of the island's 300,350 acres is controlled by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. An <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> official who requested anonymity said there were numerous small annoyances like parachutists landing by accident in someone's backyard or losing equipment that plummets to the ground. `` Things may not be completely improved in a day or two, but we understand that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military is at least trying,'' the official said in a telephone interview. The Foreign Ministry commended the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for relieving Cmdr. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as captain of the guided missile destroyer USS Towers, which fired practice shells in Japanese waters. But the ministry spokesman said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was still awaiting a full report from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> command said it was reviewing its investigation of the Towers incident and would not comment until the review was finished. Pending the review, <PERSON> Michaelis </PERSON> was reassigned to shore duty at the <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> base.

 <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Fley </PERSON> prays for the soul of his lost son, a Sandinista army officer killed in a rebel ambush, and for the health of another, a leader in the same rebel fight to oust the leftist government. `` I pray to God he will leave the Contras,'' <PERSON> Fley </PERSON> said of his son <PERSON> Luis </PERSON>, known in the rebel ranks as <PERSON> Commandante </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` He was a good boy. But it's difficult. One son is dead and the other is away.'' The divisions in the Fley family are common in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, site of a 7-year-old civil war that has pitted brothers against brothers on the battlefield. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled, leaving behind loved ones, for reasons varying from repression to opposition to the 10-year-old leftist government. <PERSON> Fley </PERSON>, 83, and his wife, <PERSON> Teodora </PERSON>, 68, raised 14 children in <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION>, a north-central mountain city. In addition to <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON>, who was killed, and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON>, with the Contras, two are officers with the Sandinista army. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> died last year at age 30 when rebels attacked the truck he was riding. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON>, 37, once a staunch Sandinista supporter, left <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> almost eight years ago to join the Contras. They are not alone. <PERSON> Christiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> runs the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, while her sister <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> is the Sandinista ambassador to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Brother <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> edits the official <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, <LOCATION> Barricada </LOCATION>; their other brother, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON>, supports the Contras. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasos </PERSON>, is the sister of <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacasa </PERSON>, who until recently was a <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Finance Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrion </PERSON>, one of nine members of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION>, is a nephew of <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION> member. The Fleys are deeply religious rural folk, retired farmers who typify the majority of Nicaraguans divided between the U.S.-supported Contras and the Soviet-backed <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. `` One of our sons died because of the war and another is away. We ca n't solve this,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Fley </PERSON>, sitting on a rocker in her sparsely decorated home. Mrs. <PERSON> Fley </PERSON> has n't seen her son <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> since he left in 1981. She spoke with him by telephone after <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> died last January. `` He called me to offer his condolences,'' she said. Her son <PERSON> Luis </PERSON>, interviewed in a Honduran rebel camp three months earlier, remembered that phone call well. `` My mother told me to come home, that she did n't want to see another son killed,'' the rebel commander said. `` I told her I was away from all that. I meant that I was away from the battlefield. I later found out -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> Chief -RRB- <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheelock </PERSON> told people I had left the Contras. The phone was tapped.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fley </PERSON> said she resisted Sandinista requests that she write or phone her son to plead for his return. Her husband, his white hair tucked beneath a faded blue cap, recalled why <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> left. `` He sold coffee at a low price, so the other salesmen said he was selling to the Contras. That's a lie. They were going to kill him,'' <PERSON> Fley </PERSON> said. `` He knew it was better to leave.'' The 37-year-old rebel commander, interviewed at the Contra camp in August, said he had questioned the freedom and equality promised by the Sandinistas, and was put in prison in 1981. `` Why did they have everything and we, in the rural regions, still had nothing? I took the rifle I used to fight against <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> and fought against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, `` he said. `` I'd like to go back to my country,'' he said. When told that her son had recently been seen at a rebel camp in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Fley </PERSON> gasped. `` If you see him, please tell him we are well ... old, poor, but well,'' she said. Sitting in the same small room was <PERSON> Maribel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>, the widow of the slain <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON>. She has never met her brother-in-law. `` In the beginning, I blamed <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> personally for killing him,'' she sid. `` But I also have brothers with the Contras ... We do n't talk about it much here What can we say?''

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> began the countdown early Monday for launching the space shuttle Atlantis on Thursday with five astronauts and an intelligence-gathering satellite. The clock begin ticking at 12:01 a.m. EST as test director <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crute </PERSON> issued the traditional `` call to stations'' that summoned more than 100 controllers to their computer consoles in the launch control center four miles from the launch pad. `` We're pressing on; the countdown has started,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Diller </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The call also was a signal for workers at the pad to begin servicing the main engines and removing work platforms from around the base of the spaceship. Because the mission is classified, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> are disclosing few details of the flight. A brief statement was issued Sunday describing the preparations completed earlier in the day with the inspection and closure of the engine compartment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are mum on the length of the flight and what the astronauts will be doing in orbit, but the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday the mission's main task is to put a new generation reconnaissance satellite, codenamed Lacrosse, into near-Earth orbit. `` The satellite will conduct surveillance of the territory of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with the help of updated radar,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in a report from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> plans to deploy in the next few years four other similar spy satellites which will play the role of an ` eye' for the new strategic bomber B-2, known as stealth,'' the Soviet agency said. As for the timing of the launch Thursday, reliable sources have said that it should take place about 7 a.m. EST if weather and other conditions are adequate. But officials will say only that launch is scheduled to occur sometime between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. They say they will make the time public when the clock reaches the 9-minute mark. A preliminary weather forecast for Thursday was not favorable, calling for overcast sky, brisk winds and a chance of showers. Once Atlantis reaches space, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans only two public announcements. The first, four hours after launch, will report briefly on the condition of the spaceship. The second will be a 24-hour advance notice on when the astronauts will land at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The silence will be broken only if a serious problem develops. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contends the secrecy makes it more difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships prowling off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> to monitor the flight and learn its purpose. Critics argue that such secrecy is unnecessary because the Soviets, with their intelligence capabilities, undoubtedly already know a great deal about the mission and that once <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>' satellite is in its own orbit, the Soviets will be able to track it precisely and know what it is doing The satellite reportedly will gather extremely sharp radar images of military targets as it follows a path that will carry it over 80 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The five military astronauts who will fly the mission are scheduled to arrive here Monday from their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to make final preparations for launch. They are <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, the commander; <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, the pilot; and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>. The flight will be the 27th for the space shuttle, the third dedicated totally to the military and the second since the Challenger explosion that killed seven crew members in January 1986. Following the accident, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> held up flights for 32 months while management and hardware changes were made. Discovery and a five-man crew returned the shuttle to space with a flight that began Sept. 29.

 Though <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> is homeless, he knows he has a warm and dry place to sleep _ as long as he does n't mind waking up several miles away from where he laid his head down. <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON>, like hundreds of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s street people, calls the city's subway system home, and officials say they expect the numbers to surge as winter sets in. `` I can always get on the subway. I usually have the fare,'' said <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON>, 78, a former mental patient who was wearing a black-knit cap, grimy pants, no shirt, a sweater and tweed coat one day last week. Bedroom slippers failed to cover his swollen feet. `` In the daytime I'm out on the bench, and at nighttime I get in the subway,'' he said, lighting a cigarette butt, which he says helps his asthma. `` In bad weather, I'll go underground.'' <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> had company that day at the 179th Street Station in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. Another homeless man was at the other end of the platform, and at least eight already were on the E train when it rolled up to start its run to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. As the winds get colder, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s subways are drawing ever more homeless people. The attraction: a warm, relatively safe environment, all for a dollar. Trains like the E line, whose route never goes above ground, are particularly popular because they stay warmer. For many riders, the disheveled and often unbathed passengers are not welcome on the nation's largest transit system. `` They stink. They're dirty. They can smell up a whole train,'' said passenger <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nashofer </PERSON>. Transit police walk a thin line, rousting homeless people who cause trouble but letting the others sleep. Maintenance crews find themselves cleaning the kinds of messes that subways were n't meant for. Subway passengers learn to select cars by scent. In response, the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> approved a plan last week to hire the <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a social service group, to patrol subway platforms and trains. Members plan to talk to the homeless and offer them the group's shelter as an alternative to sleeping underground. But many homeless people shun shelters, saying they do n't feel safe in them. Last summer, the transit authority estimated there were 1,400 people using its trains and stations as home. Advocates for the homeless say that's far too low an estimate, and the authority admits the number will be much greater this winter. The problem is not unique to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but mainly is an issue only in cities where buses and subways run all night. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, transit officials say, many homeless people, drifters and alcoholics ride buses from one end of the line to the other all night long. `` Because the homeless situation has increased in the community, I would expect public transit would get its share,'' said <PERSON> Leilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, transit director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. There is no policy against riding the buses over and over as long as people pay the fares, she said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s transit system also has no such ban. On a Manhattan-bound E train at midnight one day last week, at least 18 homeless men and one woman were sleeping. Among them was a gray-haired man with a cane and a man face down over four seats, his right foot in a cast and his crutches under the seats. An <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> man with few teeth in his mouth and few English words in his vocabulary wrapped paper napkins around a bleeding hand. `` I hit,'' he explained. Another man had his head wrapped in a black scarf, topped by a fake-fur cap and a hard hat. Three large suitcases surrounded him. `` It's like a hotel on wheels,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, a 27-year-old platform conductor. `` Eight years ago, you'd see one or two in the whole train. Now you'll see six or seven in one car,'' he said. <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidamon-Eristoff </PERSON>, a lawyer who is on the transit authority board of directors, said the transit police must exercise more authority over the homeless. `` If they've paid their dollar they have a right, providing they comport themselves with dignity,'' he said. `` But if they take up several seats, urinate, defecate, then they should be removed.'' But Transit Police Chief <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, noting that `` homelessness is not a crime,'' said criminals and fare-beaters take precedence among his force of 3,800. One homeless man said he had little choice but to use the transit system as his home. `` There's no other place you can stay in the winter,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 31. `` It's safer in the street than it is in the shelter. This is one of the few places where you can live in harmony. And it's clean.''

 Economists predict that Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, just like President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, will have a short honeymoon unless his new government can bring down the budget deficit. Concern about the deficit is troubling forecasters in both countries despite the Canadian economists' general optimism produced by the favorable election outcome for the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement. The Canadian dollar strengthened once election uncertainty was out of the way but prices declined on the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> stock exchange for two days after the Nov. 21 balloting. `` I think it's a similar situation to what happened in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Croft </PERSON>, economist for <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, Fry, <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said. `` The overriding concern is the budget deficit.'' The election gave the <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> its second consecutive majority government and cleared the way for final parliamentary approval of the trade agreement. The pact, already ratified by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, would eliminate most trade barriers between the two countries. The agreement's benefits, however, are expected to be most visible over the long term. Economists say a Canadian decision to back away from the agreement scheduled to start taking effect Jan. 1 would have negative repercussions, but positive impact will be less easy to spot in the short term. Business expansion in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, as in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has lasted for six years and the debt per capita in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is higher than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, raising fears of higher inflation and a possible recession. During <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s first term, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s government deficit fell from a record $ 31.8 billion in the 1984-85 fiscal year to an estimated $ 24 billion for 1988-89. Finance Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> has said it will be reduced further to $ 23.7 billion next year, although economists caution it could go higher if interest rates increase more than the government planned and growth is lower. `` We're in no better shape than they are,'' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Meagher </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>'s research department said. He said the markets in both countries are looking for signs that there are credible plans to reduce the deficits. <PERSON> Croft </PERSON> at Burns, Fry noted that among industrialized countries only <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> exceeds <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with a higher rate of deficit to gross domestic product. The gross domestic product is the value of the nation's annual output of goods and services, excluding returns from investments abroad. The <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s forecasts say real gross domestic product growth will slow from 4.0 percent last year and 4.3 percent in 1988 to 2.5 percent next year. More dramatically, it predicts business investment will drop from 8.8 percent in 1987 and a soaring 18.3 percent this year to 6.1 percent in 1989. The Ottawa-based, private <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>, which surveys 14 economists, projected growth of 4.2 percent for 1988 slowing to 2.3 percent next year. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, the board's chief economist, said the slowing growth rate was `` due to the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of high interest rates, the longevity of the current expansion _ now at 23 quarters _ and a weaker housing industry.'' Thirteen of the 14 economists surveyed said they expected inflation and interest rates to increase next year. The board found a consensus that the slowdown will not slip into a mild recession, but <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said: `` The risk is certainly rising.'' Inflation is projected to be 4.1 percent this year and increase to 5.0 percent in 1989. The prime minister announced rapidly after his victory that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> will stay on as finance minister. `` We know better than to spend the country into recession,'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> appearance Thursday night. `` We will maintain our commitment to gradually reduce the federal deficit... It wo n't be easy.''

 Emergency shelters house a growing throng of homeless Americans, but the need now, in the words of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> study, is for `` a stable residence'' for those who have none _ in other words, permanent housing. Noting that federal funds for low-income housing have been cut by more than three-quarters since 1981, advocates say the need for lasting shelter is critical. Some see potential in unused government-owned houses and in the shells of once-sturdy buildings that stand vacant in inner cities.

 Taxpayers around the nation own tens of thousands of houses standing empty. At the same time, tens of thousands of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families with nowhere to live overflow shelters and haunt the streets. Now the homeless and some of the publicly owned vacant homes are being brought together _ in a project that is housing families from the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> cold, in a clandestine effort to renovate and occupy a dwelling in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s restoration of entire tumbledown blocks. Activists, while encouraged, are pressing housing officials to do more, and a major decision could come in federal court next week. They say the government is skirting a law that pledges available space to those without homes. `` I think thousands of buildings could and should be usable,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a city that owns, mostly through tax default, 5,000 empty apartment buildings with many times that number of apartments and has an estimated 60,000 homeless people. One of the abandoned buildings was on <LOCATION> Leggett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in a sorry corner of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, a national symbol of blight. One of the homeless was <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, placed in a shabby welfare hotel room in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> a few years ago with her two sons, then 6 months and 2 -LCB- years old, after she split from their father and ended up on the street. `` I used to cry'cause I did n't want to be there,'' she says. Their hotel room was broken into, and drug dealing and fear were all around. After 18 months, she boarded a city van for <LOCATION> Leggett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, to look at an apartment in a building that had been restored. `` I was n't expecting anything like this,'' the 24-year-old woman said, talking to a reporter in her tidy, bright two-bedroom apartment, her boys playing across a room that's still mostly bare of furnishings. It was Ms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' day off; she's a clerk in a nearby store. Her building, whose tiled entrance foyer smelled of cleaning fluid, had been a ruin not long before. Another Bronx site still is _ but not for long. Workers there are gutting five buildings that occupy a whole block, to create 220 apartments for families like the <PERSON> Thomases </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Campisi </PERSON>, construction supervisor, outgrowled the demolition equipment as he described getting started: `` You literally could n't get in for the junkies ... Crack? Vials by the garbage-pailful.'' Leading a reporter on a tour, <PERSON> Campisi </PERSON> crunched up rubble-strewn steps to the remains of what? a parlor? Its ceiling was burned through to the sky. A green upholstered sofa stood upended in a corner. The windows let in a drizzle. `` No air-conditioning needed,'' he deadpanned. Still, he and others said fixing up buildings that landlords have abandoned is often cheaper than new construction in places like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The gutting-and-rehab job that <PERSON> Campisi </PERSON> is overseeing is to cost the city $ 15 million. How much would comparable new buildings cost? `` Maybe $ 50 million,'' he guessed. Halfway across the country, in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the vacant, publicly owned houses being readied for the homeless look different. In <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, a three-bedroom ranch house that had reverted to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> when its owners failed to make payments on a federally backed loan is being readied for a family that has been on the streets. `` We're offering properties that are in good condition,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, which hopes by next spring to lease 15 houses rent-free to non-profit groups that house the homeless. Such efforts have strong support, according to a survey earlier this year by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit think tank based in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. One thousand adults were surveyed by phone Eight in 10 favored rehabilitating old and vacant buildings for homeless Americans, who number 450,000 to 3 million, estimated by the government and advocacy groups, respectively. Sixty percent said they'd willingly pay an extra $ 120 apiece in taxes each year to expand housing efforts. `` The need for permanent housing can not be met,'' says a September report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless, without an increase in the federal budget for low-income housing _ $ 7.538 billion this year, down 77 percent from 1981's budget of $ 32.2 billion.

 Beyond dollar allocations, however, an `` enormous pool of unused -LRB- federal -RRB- property,'' in the words of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is not even being considered for use by the homeless, despite a year-old law requiring that surplus government property be made available for them. <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> made that observation in issuing a preliminary injunction two months ago, stopping <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and three other agencies from disposing of federal property that is eligible for use under the 1987 <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> Homeless Assistance Act. To <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Foscarinis </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> in the suit, `` it seemed very peculiar'' that agencies all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, when pressed to list unused or underused property, found only 12 parcels and to date have turned over only four to groups aiding the homeless. `` There are literally tens of thousands of pieces of property across the country. We ca n't be watchdogs on every one. That's why we need an aggressive order,'' she said, referring to hopes of a permanent injunction at a hearing before <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> on Dec. 5. `` The winter is hard upon us,'' the judge said, noting the urgency of the case in a Nov. 18 hearing on a request for an updated, complete list of underused property. `` What the court is fundamentally interested in ... is to make some housing available for these people.'' He added, `` I know bureaucrats. ... The thing you've got to do with bureaucrats is crack the whip and see to it that they do the job.'' Not included under the McKinney Act's broad mandate are thousands of houses the federal government owns through default on mortgages that it guarantees. Nevertheless, advocates sought in a separate lawsuit to stop the sales of those houses until they could be considered for use for the homeless. They were turned down by <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON>, and an appeal is pending. In fiscal 1988, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> sold 80,164 of these foreclosed homes at an average price of $ 38,000. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> holds more than 45,000 properties, according to department spokesman <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiduskey </PERSON>, who noted that the sales revenue goes mainly into a fund that repays lender banks that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has guaranteed against loss. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials argue that the fund would be bankrupted by 1990 if sales were stopped. There are federal programs that discount house prices for homeless-help agencies, like Ms. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and the agency's Urban Homesteading Program. <PERSON> Hiduskey </PERSON> said 200 federally owned homes have been sold at 10 percent below market value under another program for the homeless. Advocates say it's not enough. `` Homes have been disposed of with agency coffers in mind, and not national housing goals,'' asserted the report from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless. `` By and large, programs to divert parts of the inventory to aid the homeless are unpromoted and unused.'' As a result, some advocates have grown more militant. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marubio </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeless </ORGANIZATION> said that group is secretly rehabilitating an abandoned <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> apartment and will turn it over to a homeless family. `` Later on, we'll have a housewarming party and we'll ask <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials and anyone else who wants to come,'' he said. Nor is the federal government the only public landlord of vacant housing. According to checks by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, as many as 60,000 vacant or near-vacant dwellings may be in local government hands because of tax delinquency. Besides <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s roughly 5,000 empty and 4,000 partly occupied buildings, there are 6,500 in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 3,000 in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, 1,600 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and smaller numbers in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and other cities, say housing officials. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 41,000 residential properties have been declared tax delinquent for more than five years, according to <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Grau </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of non-profit developers. `` If <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> put its mind to it,'' said <PERSON> Marubio </PERSON>, `` we could house the homeless.'' In the last three years, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has turned 12 abandoned buildings, out of 100, into shelters for the homeless. The purchase of 50 houses from the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is part of a $ 3.1 million <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> plan to provide 490 units of permanent housing for the homeless. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, `` by 1993, every vacant, city-owned building that can be rebuilt will be renovated already or in a program to rebuild,'' said <PERSON> Catie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> of the city <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> and Development. In 1986, Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> announced a 10-year housing plan, costing more than $ 5 billion. But that plan, meant to produce housing for many income groups, should be redrawn to direct more of the money toward the homeless, says <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, a lawyer representing an advocacy group, <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, in a suit against <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. Even so, the plan's provision for rehabilitating old buildings instead of constructing new ones `` economically ... makes sense,'' <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> said. If those squeezed out of homes because of high prices and other factors are to be saved from the streets, he said, `` The vacant, abandoned stock that the city has taken title to is the key.''

<TEXT>
 The countdown began today for Thursday's launch of shuttle Atlantis, which will carry five astronauts and a secret satellite that reportedly will gather military intelligence over the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The clock began ticking at 12:01 a.m. EST as <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> test director <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crute </PERSON> issued the traditional `` call to stations'' that assembled more than 100 controllers at computer consoles in the launch control center four miles from the launch pad. The call also was a signal for workers at the pad to begin servicing Atlantis' engines and removing work platforms from the base of the spaceship. `` We're pressing on; the countdown has started,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Diller </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Because the mission is classified, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> are disclosing few details of the flight, including its length and what the astronauts will be doing. As for the launch time, sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said it should take place about 7 a.m. EST if weather and other conditions are adequate. But officials will say only that launch is scheduled for sometime between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. Thursday. They say they will make the time public when the clock reaches the nine-minute mark. A preliminary weather forecast for Thursday called for unfavorable conditions: overcast sky, brisk winds and possible showers. Atlantis' crew, all military officers, planned to fly here this afternoon from their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to make final preparations for launch. Instead of making the usual arrival comments to the news media, they have been advised to say nothing. The crew commander is <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. The pilot is Air Force Lt. Col. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, and the mission specialists are Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON> and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>. After Atlantis reaches orbit, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans only two public statements. The first, four hours after launch, will report briefly on the condition of the spaceship. The second will be a 24-hour advance notice on when the astronauts will land at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The silence will be broken only if a serious problem develops. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials contend the secrecy makes it more difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships operating off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> to monitor the flight and learn its purpose. Critics argue that such secrecy is unnecessary because the Soviets, with their intelligence capabilities, already know a great deal about the mission. In fact, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday: `` The main task of the secret mission is to put into near-Earth orbit a new generation reconnaissance satellite, codenamed Lacrosse. The satellite will conduct surveillance of the territory of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with the help of updated radar. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> plans to deploy in the next few years four other similar spy satellites which will play the role of an ` eye' for the new strategic bomber B-2, known as stealth.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> critics also say that once <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>' satellite is in its own orbit, the Soviets will be able to track it precisely and know what it is doing. Much already has been published about the satellite, based on reports from sources who say it will gather extremely sharp radar images of Soviet military targets as it follows a course that covers 80 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The flight will be the 27th for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle, the third dedicated totally to the military and the second since the Challenger explosion that killed seven crew members in January 1986. The Challenger accident kept the shuttle fleet grounded for 32 months. Discovery and a five-man crew had a successful flight that began Sept. 29.

<BYLINE>USDA Says Demand Still Up For Rail Cars, River Barges
^By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst says that in the wake of this summer's drought, demand for rail cars and river barges has kept shipping prices at relatively high levels. `` Navigation on the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> has nearly returned to normal,'' said T.Q. <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Rain has restored most channels and reservoirs to navigable depths, although they are still low.'' The river's carrying capacity was still low going into this fall's harvest, and barge operating costs are still high. And the lesser flow forced authorities to limit the number of barges permitted in a single tow. Grain shipments on the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> rivers during July and August averaged 3 million tons per month, down 30 percent from May _ the month before navigation was impaired _ and 17 percent below June. `` Some of the reduction stemmed from limited barge capacity, but reduced exports also contributed,'' <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said in the current issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. According to export inspection figures for June, July and August, monthly grain exports averaged about 20 percent below May. Shipments through <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> ports dropped 16 percent to 140 million bushels in June, rose slightly to 144 million in June and then to 148 million in August. Barge rates, meanwhile, were up from a year earlier by about 24 percent during the first five months of 1988. In June, as river problems developed, the rates soared. At <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, rates to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> averaged $ 17.44 per ton, compared with $ 6.37 the week before. <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said the hike was shortlived, although the average for all of June was $ 9.86 per ton, up 59 percent from May. By August, rates were down to $ 7.61, only 45 cents more than the January-May average. However, prospects for large corn sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> pushed barge rates above $ 10 again in September. In late June, he said, the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern railroad announced a series of increases to achieve `` barge competitive'' rates for hauling wheat. For shipments to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, for example, the new rates would have amounted to an additional $ 197 per rail car in August and a further increase of $ 276 per car in September, a 26 percent increase from June. For some destinations, the rates announced by the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> would have driven up rail rates in December to 80 percent above last June, <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said. `` When announced, the rate hikes appeared likely to prevail because demand for rail service was record high and the drought had sharply curtailed barge capacity,'' <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said. `` Moreover, other railroads were expected to raise their rates by like amounts.'' But rates for grain remained nearly level during July and August as demand for rail services declined sharply, he said. Preliminary data showed, in fact, that grain rates actually fell slightly in July and then edged back up in August to their June levels. <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION>'s rail rates for October and November, based on sales of transportation certificates, may be up less than 2 percent from August and that they could decline in December. Certificates are fixed-price contracts for service to be provided in future months.

<HEAD>Health Official Sees Medicare Savings Without Cuts To Elderly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The doctor who now oversees the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program and who may play a role in the next administration says he sees no conflict between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desire for a kinder <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and indications the president-elect will seek major <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> savings `` Of all the list of problems of our health care system, I for one do n't believe one of the problems is too little money,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said in an interview last week. `` The problem is we're not spending as best we could the money we are spending.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, pressed by reporters about his budget chief's assertion that <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> cuts are likely to be a part of a deficit-reduction drive, said only that he wants to make the program `` more efficient.'' <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, has a working relationship with several members of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff, including <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON>, the vice president's chief health policy adviser during the campaign. Prior to the election, <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON> offered one example of how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s so-called `` flexible freeze'' on federal spending might affect Medicare Given the spiraling cost of health care in general, she said, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> might grow by 8 percent while other programs were held below the general inflation rate. In last week's interview, <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> threw out the same hypothetical figure to illustrate possible spending for Part B, the portion of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> that pays doctor bills and has been growing at about 15 percent a year. `` It's the idea of saying in 1989 we're going to spend what we spent this year plus 8 percent and that's all we're going to spend,'' he said. `` That's all there is. There ai n't no more.'' Whatever the final approach, both Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> health experts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agree that Part B is ripe for scrutiny if only because of its headlong growth. Despite widespread criticism that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration cuts in Medicare spending threatened the welfare of the nearly 32 million elderly and disabled Americans covered by the program, the thrust of the approach has been to cut into the profits of providers such as hospitals rather than reducing benefits. <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, the first physician to head the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program, acknowledges that the next target will be doctor fees and that the outcry will be intense. `` <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> is the favorite four-letter word of the health care community and I think it is probably always going to be that way,'' he said ruefully. Still, he said, `` It makes no sense for me as a political manager of this huge program to say we're going to willy-nilly spend money, write a blank check to whoever and at the same time be confronted with the present reality of the problems in the health care system and no dollars to do anything about it.'' Among those admitted problems, he said, are infant mortality rates higher than other industrialized nations, lack of full access to health care for 37 million uninsured Americans and inadequate long-term care programs for a rapidly aging population. `` If the kinder, gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is going to be able to respond to the problems the vice president has seen, we've got to have some money to do it with,'' said <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>. `` If the flexible freeze is going to work, then on average, programs have to go at the inflation rate. And if we've got problems like Part B of Medicare that are growing at several times the inflation rate, something has got to give.'' He acknowledged that wringing significant savings from the program will not come quickly. The eventual answer, he maintains, is getting more value for dollars spent, which requires a more questioning attitude to the way medicine is practiced _ a highly emotional topic for doctor and patient alike. `` Up until recently, the presumption has been if a doctor orders it, it must be necessary, it must be effective,'' he said. `` Now we're saying maybe so, maybe not and lets get the information together to judge that question.'' To support that approach, <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> recently established programs to accumulate massive amounts of data on which procedures and tests work and which do n't, with an eye toward possibly revising Medicare payment policies. While the <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> job is widely acknowledged to be one of the major `` no win'' posts in the health bureaucracy, <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said he's `` had a ball'' serving there. He is guarded about his prospects during the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` I am a longtime admirer and supporter of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and wish him every success,'' he said. `` ... If there is some way I can be useful in this department, I'd certainly like to hear about it.''

<HEAD>Energy Officials Plan For New, Safer Reactors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As engineers struggle with the aging plants that now produce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons material, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials are drawing up plans for two new, safer reactors expected to cost a total of $ 6.8 billion. One proposed design, the smaller and more expensive of two envisioned, involves technologies that some engineers believe will lead to commercial reactors that drastically reduce the dangers of meltdown and contamination. Building new reactors has assumed new urgency since April, when engineers last were able to safely operate the remaining three production reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` We feel that we can make the plants at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> operate safely, although they are nearing the end of their operational lives,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> office for the new reactors. The first of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors is not expected to resume production of tritium, a critical nuclear weapons material, before January. The new reactors should begin operation in about 1999, said <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>. However, persuading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve funding for both reactors may be impossible, given the budget deficit and the $ 110 billion the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it will need to clean up the existing complex and make it safe. An <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advisory panel, in a report last July, found `` that one of the challenges was to get a new production reactor built before the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> reactors reach the end of their useful lives,'' said <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> recommended building two new reactors, a heavy-water reactor at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for an estimated $ 3.2 billion and a gas-cooled reactor at the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION>, an Energy Department site near <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, for about $ 3.6 billion. `` The point of having two is to provide the maximum level of assurance ... at two geographic locations, so that nothing like a seismic event could shut down production,'' said <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>. Like the three existing reactors, the new one at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> would use heavy water as a moderator. It have new safety and design features, but rely on tritium extraction techniques that have been proven since 1954. The new <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactor would be adequate to make all of the tritium needed for nuclear weapons and the gas-cooled reactor in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> would produce at half that rate. Both would be built with containment vessels, steel-reinforced concrete domes like that which prevented the escape of nearly all the lethal materials from the Three Mile Island accident in March 1979. The current <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> reactors rely instead on thick concrete walls and air-filtration systems to confine radioactivity. Despite its smaller production capacity and igher cost, the gas-cooled reactor planned for <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> has many advantages. In high-pressure light-water reactors, fuel can reach 4,100 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt the casing and turn the fuel into an uncontrollable molten mass if the flow of cooling water is interrupted. In a gas-cooled reactor, meanwhile, uranium grains can reach a maximum temperature of 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit while the shells in which they are encased do not deteriorate below 3,300 degrees, making a meltdown or radiation leak theoretically impossible even if the flow of coolant stops for an indefinite period. The gas-cooled reactor at <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> also could generate dollars by generating commercial electricity through the year 2038, <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said. Lawmakers from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> already are beginning to maneuver to make sure that their states are not left out as plans for the reactors move forward. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, at an Oct. 5 hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Strategic Forces and Nuclear Deterrence, said he wanted to `` commend the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> on its recent decision to locate the New Production Reactor at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Plant'' and would keep an eye on its progress.

If the facts had come out in 1985, <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said in an Oct. 7 speech on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, `` we would be breaking ground right now on a New Production Reactor. And it would not be at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.''

 The irreverent march of loonies that made up this year's 12th Occasional Doo-Dah parade featured chain-saw wielding marchers ready to attack the crowd. But not to worry: The chains had been removed from the saws, so the blades were n't running. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Chainsaw Chainsaw Massacre Drool Team and Night Of the Living Dead Dishonor Guard showered Sunday's crowd with fake blood and charged at spectators with the roaring chain saws. An old favorite at the Doo-Dah gala, the Synchronized Briefcase Drill Team, celebrated its 10th appearance at the parade with a new routine, `` The Big O,'' in which the young executives in business suits piled their briefcases in a stack and marched around them in a circle. A child driving a toy truck was billed as hauling the radar-evading stealth bomber, unveiled last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The tow hook was attached to nothing. The parade was started in 1977 as an answer to what organizers felt was the stuffy Tournament of Roses, the <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> showcase held on New Year's Day, except when Jan. 1 falls on a Sunday.

<HEAD>Sununu Receives School Benefits Six Years After Leaving</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Six years after he last taught at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> remains on the school faculty in what one official calls an `` extremely rare'' arrangement that allows his children to receive tuition waivers and other aid. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> governor chosen to serve as White House chief of staff in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, last week declined to be discuss the arrangement but said last summer, `` I never asked for any different treatment. This was all done by the board of trustees.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> has had two children enrolled in Tufts since he left the university and also has children attending the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The children attending <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> are granted full tuition waivers and those at other colleges receive tuition subsidies from <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> as part of faculty benefits <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> has received during his six years on leave from the school, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> officials. Tuition at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> in the 1987-88 school year was $ 11,750. An official who oversees faculty benefits at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> said general school policy is to grant leaves for up to two years. But policies governing such extended leaves by faculty at private colleges and universities vary greatly, with the longest leaves generally granted to professors who quit their academic posts for high-profile government assignments. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> announced in May that he would not seek a fourth term as governor and has spent much of his time since then working for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. During the presidential campaign he served as a chief <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> surrogate attacking the record of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democrats' nominee. In announcing that he would not seek another term, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> cited his $ 68,000 a year gubernatorial salary as too small. His wife specifically said college tuition bills were a factor in her husband's decision to leave his post. As White House chief of staff, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> can earn up to $ 89,500, according to government pay scales. <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> officials confirmed <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> remains on leave from his tenured teaching post in the mechanical engineering department but referred most questions about the circumstances of his leave to President <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, who did not return repeated messages from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>'s secretary said the school president told her he would have no comment on <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s status. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said last summer he intended to eventually return to teaching at <LOCATION> Tufts </LOCATION> but had not discussed a date with school officials. In the school's latest catalog, published in Aug. 15, 1988, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> remains listed as an associate professor of mechanical engineering. `` Why not?'' he answered when asked if he believed it was appropriate for his children to continue to receive tuition waivers and assistance from <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION>. Attempts to reach <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> this week to discuss his status at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, the governor's spokesman, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> did not have time to conduct an interview. Children of <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> faculty members, and most other colleges and universities, are allowed to attend that school free of charge. Tufts policy also allows children of <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> faculty to receive $ 1,250 a semester for a maximum of $ 2,500 a year to help pay their bills at any other accredited college, according to <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, academic affairs officer at <LOCATION> Tufts </LOCATION>. Whether those benefits are extended to faculty members on leaves varies from school to school, according to an informal survey of a dozen private colleges and universities. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said he believed his children at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> received $ 1,250 a year from <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION>. He said he did not believe, as Ms. <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> said, that they were eligible for $ 2,500. The school, citing confidentiality guidelines, refused to say how much assistance was given to <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> children attending schools other than <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION>. But it released the amount which they are eligible to receive. Ms. <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, to whom all questions about faculty benefits were referred, said all benefits are available to faculty on full leaves, including health and disability insurance. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> does not receive a salary from the school. She termed it `` rare'' for a faculty member to be granted a leave of more than two years and `` extremely rare'' for a leave to be approved for five years or more. A department chairman must recommend a faculty member for a leave and the recommendation must be approved by the school's dean, she said. Leaves are reviewed annually, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Rosemarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Camp </PERSON> disputed parts of Ms. <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>'s account and said extended leaves are `` routinely'' given to faculty members who enter the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, an apparent reference to those who leave <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fletcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Diplomacy for diplomatic jobs. Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Camp </PERSON> said she could not recall any current or former faculty member except <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> who had been granted an extended leave while holding elective office. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s leave `` was not an action of my office. I suppose he asked for it to be continued but that was handled by the president's office. He referred all other questions to <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> joined the Mechanical Engineering faculty at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> in 1967 and remained in the post until he was first elected <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> governor in November 1982. His daughter <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> in 1982, while <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> still was teaching there. Another daughter, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, graduated in 1983, the first year of her father's leave of absence and first year as governor. A third daughter, <PERSON> Christina </PERSON>, a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION>, is currently enrolled in a graduate program at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION>, according to school officials who refused to discuss her specific course of study. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, attends <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> and another son, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, attends <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>.

 If clothes make the man, an inmate with nothing to wear but stained jeans and a T-shirt does n't cut a very impressive figure in court. Assistant Public Defender <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON> says her clients' wardrobes have troubled her for years By last spring, she had seen too many of her clients _ many in jail since their arrest _ come poorly dressed to court. So Ms. <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON> and another <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> public defender, <PERSON> Melody </PERSON> <PERSON> Merola </PERSON>, organized a clothes service in a hall closet. `` I decided, ` Why not have a few things here at the office?''' Ms. <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON> recalled. `` We call it ` the PD boutique.' The name stuck.'' Defense attorneys say they know clothing can prejudice a jury, and they are wary of clothes-conscious judges. Ms. <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON> said she's seen clients reprimanded from the bench for improper attire `` I think there's always a difference between a person who's neatly dressed as opposed to one who comes to court in cutoffs and a T-shirt,'' she said `` A court of law is a place of respect.'' With donations from 40 attorneys and the public, the closet has begun to fill up. The office now can loan six suits, 17 pairs of pants and 20 shirts for men. Many more clothes are available for women, but they are a small portion of the office's clients. Located in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s largest city and representing a clientele often too poor to post even the lowest bail, the public defenders' clothes service was an immediate hit, the lawyers say About 15 defendants have made use of the clothes so far, and not all have returned the garments. `` We represent indigent clients and a lot of them really do n't have very much,'' Ms. <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON> said `` When they are arrested, they are literally arrested with the only clothes they have _ usually a pair of pants and a shirt. `` One time, I had a guy who came to court in lime-green stretch pants and navy blue sweat shirt turned inside out. He said he had to borrow it from someone else,'' she said. The public defenders want their clients wearing `` the kind of clothes that, walking down the street, you would n't look at them twice,'' Ms. <PERSON> Merola </PERSON> said. `` It becomes very, very important that the client is afforded the basic dignity of looking decent.''

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews Nov. 10-20 with 1,084 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The phone numbers were selected randomly by computer. Interviews were conducted with the adult in the household who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 of 20 times. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 5 points, for example, for Democrats. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and responses in this poll; because of rounding, percentages may not total 100: 1.

 Americans want military patrols and a crackdown on users to combat illegal drugs, but many doubt the choice of Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to run the effort, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found. Although <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a campaign pledge to put his running mate in charge of the fight against drugs, only 32 percent of the 1,084 adults surveyed said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was the right man for the job. As many were n't sure about the selection, and 36 percent said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was not the right choice to lead the drug war. Republicans were more supportive of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, but fewer than half of them backed him as drug chief. Although the bill creating the Cabinet-level drug czar prohibits the official from holding another federal post, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has indicated he might have the drug czar report to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The nationwide poll's respondents far and away said reducing the federal budget deficit should be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s to priority as president _ 10 times as many as picked drugs. Majorities backed a tax crackdown and cuts in defense spending to address the deficit. The survey also found support for restrictions on foreign investments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and broad backing for aggressive measures to address the federal trade deficit, including higher import taxes and quotas. On drugs, six in 10 favored drug testing of all federal employees and two in 10 favored testing some of them. The government now conducts random tests of federal workers in sensitive jobs, and has proposed testing privately employed transportation workers. There also was support for other drug-fighting efforts. Eight in 10 said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should push for a crackdown on illegal drug users and as many or more backed more federal spending for drug enforcement, education and treatment. Three-quarters said the military should patrol the nation's borders for drug smugglers But considerably fewer, 40 percent, said the military should strike at illegal drug operations abroad. In addressing the deficit, respondents firmly opposed most new or higher taxes. Most also opposed cuts in spending for domestic programs such as welfare or a freeze in Social Security benefits. Strong majorities, however, supported higher taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. And a narrow majority, 52 percent, favored defense spending cuts. The survey also found overwhelming support for an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> crackdown to collect taxes, an approach urged by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the presidential campaign but ridiculed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The poll, conducted Nov. 10-20, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Those polled were asked: `` What do you think should be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s No. 1 priority once he takes office?'' Thirty-four percent said the deficit, an unusually high rate of agreement in an open-ended question. No other category drew a response rate in double digits. Seven percent cited other economic matters, 5 percent said poverty or homelessness, 5 percent said defense and the rest were other issues. Only 3 percent said drugs, an issue that ranked far higher in importance in pre-election polls during the summer but then faded in the fall. Respondents gave mixed signals on how to address the deficit. Two-thirds, for example, favored higher corporate taxes _ but a third of that group said they would change their minds if corporations responded by raising prices. Opposition to other taxes was stronger: Eight in 10 opposed higher personal income taxes, three-quarters opposed higher gasoline taxes, three-quarters opposed taxing the Social Security benefits of higher-income Americans and 64 percent opposed a national sales tax. Only defense cuts were favored by a majority, with particular support from liberals and Democrats but also backing from moderates and independents. When respondents were asked specifically if they supported cuts in the Strategic Defense Initiative missile defense program, or Star Wars, 56 percent did. On the foreign trade deficit, 65 percent said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should impose higher taxes on imports, and most said they would hold to that position even if it increased prices for some goods and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners retaliated. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> said he will return from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week to appeal his conviction and 20-year sentence on corruption charges. The former president and businessmen <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Almonte </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> were found guilty Sunday of embezzling about $ 5 million in government funds by selling equipment to the armed forces and the national police at inflated prices during the last two years of <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON>'s 1982-1986 term. In a televised interview from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where he has been living for the past 1 -LCB- years, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> called his conviction `` monstrous'' and vowed to return to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> on Wednesday. He was tried in abstentia. Judge <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Severino </PERSON> sentenced the three to 20 years in prison and ordered them to pay a total fine of $ 17.3 million. Six of the other eight alleged co-conspirators in the case were found innocent, and the other two were to be tried separately for the same charges. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON>, 60, is the first former <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> head of state to be convicted of corruption. Under Dominican law, the former president could not present a defense or witnesses without appearing before the court. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Morel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerda </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> will be jailed as soon as he arrives. But the appeal will put the sentence on hold during a retrial. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> was charged with ordering the country's military chiefs to buy 75 percent of the vehicles, uniforms, foodstuffs and other necessities for the armed forces and national police from firms owned by <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Almonte </PERSON>. <PERSON> Almonte </PERSON>, a millionaire banker with interests in automotive dealerships throughout the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON>, who has supplied materials to the military and police for 20 years, listened calmly as the judge read the sentence. They were transferred under heavy police escort to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, 12 miles from the capital. The businessmen's lawyers said they will appeal.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> businesswoman who found love with a veteran 82-year-old musher through <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Iditarod dog-sled race has sold her company to train for this winter's Arctic race. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Muegge </PERSON>, 46, met <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> about three years ago when she and a friend attended a party in his honor. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> colonel, was working with an Atlanta-based expedition to try to salvage seven World War II aircraft buried in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>'s ice pack. He drove a dog team during one of Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> expeditions in the 1930s and helped transport wounded soldiers from the front lines in the World War II Battle of the Bulge. `` We were just crashing the party, but he made us stay,'' <PERSON> Muegge </PERSON> recalled in a recent interview. `` After about 15 minutes, he said, ` I need somebody to be my handler over the winter, drive up over the -LRB- <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> -RRB- highway with me. Can you come?' `` I thought, Oh God, I had a business to run. But here was this intriguing, alluring offer to go to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to spend some time with a man like him.'' A few days later she agreed, and they spent three weeks preparing for the 1986 Iditarod race over the 1,049 miles from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. `` I'd never been in the snow. Here I am, this girl from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, up there in 17-below cold,'' she said. She rode in a second sled towed by <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>'s team during the first 20 miles out of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, which is required by race rules. `` It just killed me'' when <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> went on without her, she said, `` so I decided some day I've got to run a race.'' In 1987, she ran her own team alongside <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> _ `` he was kind of like my security blanket'' _ but they finished last after the official time limit expired. `` I had a budget rent-a-team. They were a slow team and it was a small team and we had some problems along the way and we ran into a snowstorm out on the Yukon that detained us for four days,'' she said. The couple married Dec. 31, 1987, at <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>'s cabin at <LOCATION> Trapper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` All the guests came by dog team or snow machine,'' <PERSON> Muegge </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Muegge </PERSON> did n't run in this year's race. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, who has been mushing dogs for 60 years, was the oldest competitor but abandoned the race when some of his dogs went into heat. He has finished three races in 10 tries, usually at the back of the pack. <PERSON> Muegge </PERSON>, a self-described `` adventure junkie,'' is a skilled whitewater paddler, bicyclist, outdoor adventurer and judo expert. She ran Executive Expeditions in <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, taking corporate executives to the outdoors. `` I do n't really know what draws me to that sort of thing, except it's the personal challenge to me to see if I can survive,'' she said. <PERSON> Muegge </PERSON> sold her business earlier this year. She and her husband plan to train four months with their dogs for next March's race. Another woman, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, has won the race the past two years and is the only three-time winner, but <PERSON> Muegge </PERSON> is n't aiming to win. She does hope to improve on her previous effort and beat her husband. `` It's sort of like you got ta go for it when it's there and take the opportunity and somehow find a way to do it. The worst that happens is that I have to start all over again,'' she said.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers and AIDS support groups say they are concerned that discrimination could result from a legal expert's contention that AIDS dementia may become a public health hazard in the workplace <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, a public health lawyer and visiting professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in the Preventive Law Reporter that employers should transfer people with the AIDS virus out of `` physically risky'' jobs. Otherwise, he maintained, the companies could be liable in case of an accident caused by AIDS dementia, a complication in which the virus attacks the brain and neurological system. `` An employee who is unfit for hazardous activity endangers himself and other employees,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> wrote in September's issue of the periodical put out by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for Preventive Law. `` In jobs such as driving a truck or providing professional services, an impaired employee may also endanger customers and the general public,'' he said. But researchers dispute <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' view that AIDS virus carriers run a significant risk of developing AIDS dementia, particularly to a degree that would impair their job performance. They say too little is known about AIDS dementia to begin regulating it in the workplace. Only a tiny minority of carriers who have n't developed other symptoms of AIDS show signs of dementia, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, AIDS policy officer at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. He added that <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' proposal is `` running the risk of discriminating against one population group unduly.'' AIDS dementia was recognized last year by the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> as a formal diagnosis for AIDS. It can strike people who carry the AIDS virus, also known as HIV, leading to memory loss, impaired motor functions and other mental and behavioral problems. AIDS dementia is comparable to other progressive neurological diseases like <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>'s and Parkinson's, researchers say. It is most common among people who have developed AIDS, they say, and studies show up to 90 percent of people who die of complications from AIDS show symptoms of dementia. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> stressed that little or no danger of spreading AIDS in the workplace exists. But, he said, advanced AIDS dementia can make people unfit for certain jobs just as diabetes, epilepsy or back injuries can be grounds for denying someone a particular job. He recommended that employers `` routinely screen employees and job applicants for evidence of HIV infection.'' Dr. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobayashi </PERSON>, who counsels many HIV-positive patients as director of psychiatric consultation services at <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said the data `` is still very sparse'' as to how severe the manifestations of AIDS dementia will be. `` Even if there were some changes, it's not at all clear the dysfunctions would be significant enough to disqualify -LRB- HIV-positive people -RRB- from working,'' <PERSON> Kobayashi </PERSON> said. `` I'm not discounting it as an issue. But just because HIV may be present in the brain does n't mean a person is demented or that their cognition will be affected.'' The World Health Organization in March said: `` There is no evidence that asymptomatic, HIV-1 infected individuals pose special problems in safety-related occupations.'' The WHO report noted that factors including stress, fatigue, aging, psychological disorders, and drug and alcohol use can affect job performance. `` The critical issue is not the cause of impaired job performance, but the ability to detect impairment whatever the cause,'' it concluded. <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' ideas contradict `` a trend where organizations and corporations are working out various accommodations so people with the virus can stay on in their jobs. ... `` What we're finding is that people -LRB- with the HIV virus -RRB- are functioning very well in the workplace and I think you'd be hard pressed to find any incidents that would support what he is saying.'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said having the virus would n't disqualify people from performing most tasks. `` In general, <ORGANIZATION> ADC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- AIDS dementia complex -RRB- would disqualify an employee from performing any activity where being drunk or under the influence of other drugs would be a disqualification,'' he said. `` As a preventive lawyer, I think it's critical that employers learn about these problems before plaintiffs' lawyers do.''

 The dollar surged against the Japanese yen Monday, and stock prices were sharply lower due to concern over higher oil prices and the possibility of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rate increase. At the end of trading, the dollar was quoted at 122.00 yen, up 0.85 yen from Friday's close of 121.15 yen. It opened higher at 121.60 yen and moved between 121.58 yen and 122.00 yen throughout the day. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 43.06-point loser during Saturday's half-day session, fell another 380.27 points or 1.3 percent to close at 28,983.32 points. A dealer at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said the dollar `` was being bought in expectation that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monetary authorities may -LRB- raise -RRB- prime lending rates and the nation's discount rate,'' the rate the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to commercial banks.

The dollar's strength paralleled the firmness of the British pound despite an increase in British interest rates after news last week of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s wider-than-expected current account deficit, the dealer said. The firmer dollar, expectations of a move by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and higher oil prices encouraged investors to take profits from the recent rally on the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market, pushing prices lower, analysts said.

 `` Andy Answer'' is a cartoon dog in a medical lab coat who dispenses information about AIDS to school children. He tells kids it's OK to be around people who have AIDS, to play with them, hug them, and study with them, and he assures them they need n't worry about getting AIDS because they do n't share needles and are n't ready to have sex. `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Answer </PERSON>' is the star of `` A is for AIDS,'' a new videotape for children that will be shown this spring to about 4,000 fifth-graders in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Unified School District. `` If kids are playing ` AIDS-tag' in the playground, and they start thinking some guy's going to give them AIDS by touching them, we have to do something about correcting it,'' says <PERSON> Alissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralston </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS Advisory Committee. Several other school districts around the country, including in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, are considering the tape for children, some as young as second grade. `` We need to reassure young children who worry about AIDS because of the kinds of comments they hear adults making,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskin </PERSON>, administrator for health programs for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s schools `` This videotape is very positive, in good taste with appropriate language.'' <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyers </PERSON>, a journalist and video producer in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, made `` A is for AIDS'' with co-writer and director <PERSON> Aron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> after Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> urged that AIDS education begin as early as elementary school. `` We have n't been talking about AIDS very much at the fourth and fifth grade levels because it's a sensitive issue,'' says <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueler </PERSON>, coordinator of the school library program for the 29,000-student <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, Unified School District. `` Everything we looked at was for older people in the work place or in high school, but this tape looked pretty good for our students.'' In the videotape, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> takes children on a trip inside a human body to explain how the disease works. Animated ugly germs with fangs attack armies of white blood cells led by mustachioed `` generals,'' or T4 cells, that direct the body's immune system. The animation shows the panicked white cells overcome by germs, and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> explains that it sometimes takes a long time for people with AIDS to become really sick. `` The AIDS virus destroys the immune system, leaving the body with no protection against disease. And that's why many people with AIDS become very sick and even die.'' Dr. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Peeks </PERSON>, assistant dean at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, appears on the tape to explain, with an air of authority, that AIDS can not be caught by touching a person or a doorknob, by swimming, sitting on a bus or getting bit by a mosquito. The tape does not refer to homosexuality. Its only hint that AIDS can be transmitted sexually is that the children in the tape, who are about 11 years old, `` are n't ready to have sex.'' The tape also features visits with two children _ a 9-year-old girl in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> born with AIDS because her mother shared a needle with an AIDS victim, and 16-year-old <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, a hemophiliac who got AIDS from a blood transfusion. Both segments show the children surrounded by family and friends not afraid about catching the disease. Of the 78,985 AIDS cases reported since 1981, 1,257 have been children under 13, including 1,020 under age 5, according to the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Nine hundred seventy-seven other children have parents with AIDS or are considered at risk of getting the disease. More than 44,000 AIDS patients, or 56 percent of all cases, have died. `` It's scary stuff,'' said <PERSON> Ralston </PERSON>, who wrote a parents' guidebook on AIDS `` You do n't want your kid walking around worried unnecessarily that they're going to catch this disease. At the same time you want to let them know what the risks are, like if you find a needle at the playground, you do n't touch it. That's AIDS prevention for kindergartners.''

 Charging too few Iranian prisoners of war were being returned by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it has halted its exchange of prisoners from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> conflict. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> on Sunday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, sponsor of the exchange, demanding the immediate release of an additional 67 Iranians. Under a Nov. 11 accord, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to release up to 1,570 sick and disabled POWs in batches of about 150, who would fly home aboard a plane chartered by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The 10-day operation started Thursday, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> freed 52 Iraqi prisoners instead of 110 due for repatriation that day. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said the remainder asked for asylum in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or recovered from their wounds and no longer were eligible for exchange. In retaliation, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> sent back 19 instead of 41 Iranian POWs. The third prisoner swap took place Sunday with 52 Iraqis and 19 Iranians being released. `` By continuing this behavior, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in effect will keep imprisoned many sick and wounded Iranian prisoners, and their release will not be guaranteed,'' the Iranian radio quoted the letter as saying. The radio also quoted the head of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s committee for war prisoners, <PERSON> Ataollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohajerani </PERSON>, as saying `` the continuation of the prisoner exchange depends on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s release of 67 Iranian POWs.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officials had no immediate comment on the Iranian announcement. U.N.-sponsored peace negotiations following an Aug. 20 cease-fire in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war are stalled, but the prisoner exchange agreement was reached in separate talks with the Red Cross. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has registered names of 50,182 Iraqi and 19,284 Iranian POWs, but estimates the total number on both sides at 100,000. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 22 Iraqi POWs due for release on Sunday were `` ineligible'' because they had recovered from their disability. The agency, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said nine others stayed on for further medical examinations while three more were granted asylum in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said only 10 soldiers were among the 19 Iranians repatriated Sunday. It described the others as civilians _ some aged over 60 _ who were captured by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops shortly after they invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980. Before the current exchange, the two gulf war foes repatriated 765 Iraqi and 613 Iranian sick and wounded prisoners since 1981.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> and his nine <PERSON> Plott </PERSON> hounds are having trouble finding steady employment guiding would-be bear hunters. Despite a resurgence in the state's black bear population, restrictions on guide licenses and the length of the state's hunting season have limited bear hunts. `` Nobody makes a living guiding bear hunters with dogs,'' said <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON>, a 36-year-old logger from <LOCATION> Ashfield </LOCATION>. `` It's got to be something you love. It's for the sport not the money.'' <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON>'s job helps pay for his avocation and the costs that go along with owning the Alaskan-bred hounds. The 500 black bears found in 400 square miles north of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Turnpike between the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Berkshires </LOCATION> form one of the densest populations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, wildlife officials say. Hunters had nearly eliminated the bears in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> before the hunting season was trimmed in 1969 from 10 weeks to one _ the third week in November when most bears are hibernating. But the bears' acquired taste for corn, which provides them with a stable food source, began taking a bite out of some farmers' harvests So in 1982, the state authorized a second week of hunting, during late September. Unlike the November season, when just two or three bears are killed, hunters are allowed to track with hounds in September. Thirty-five black bears were killed in September and 32 in September 1987. About half were caught with the help of hounds, said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> MacCallum </PERSON>, acting director of the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. He said about 1,100 bear hunters are licensed in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and each is limited to one bear per season _ hence, the dearth of work for hunting guides. <LOCATION> Sprague </LOCATION>, who has tagged or shot about 1,000 bears during the last 15 years, said he occasionally guides hunters on six-day excursions in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, often camping out in the deep woods when a bear has led them far from their base camp. `` It's an extremely strenuous sport,'' he said. `` You're following a pack of hounds and you have to go where they're going They're following the bear and he's going to go anywhere he can find to get away.'' As a child, <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> began hunting woodchucks in his neighbors' fields Lacking for recreation in his rural hometown, <LOCATION> Sprague </LOCATION>'s love for the sport grew as his father took him hunting on weekends. But after hunting in 17 states and all the Canadian provinces, most of the bear chasing <LOCATION> Sprague </LOCATION> does is for wildlife researchers who collar bears to track them and analyze their behavior. `` I run bears and tree them. We let most of the bears we get go _ very few bears do we ever actually harvest,'' he said. Killing female or young bears endangers the population and research shows a hound pursuit is preferable to baiting traps and stalking. Some farmers in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> try to bag bears wandering into their cornfields by shooting from behind blinds set up along paths a bear is known to frequent. But by chasing a bear up a tree, <LOCATION> Sprague </LOCATION> can take the time to determine the animal's sex and age. `` A still hunter has no way of making that judgment because he has three to five seconds to make a shot,'' <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> said. `` They all look big to somebody the first time they see one.''

 A woman says she has forgiven her husband, who is accused of killing their two young sons by placing them in a 1,300-degree foundry ladle, and will deal with the criticism for taking him back. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON>, 29, sat in a car on Thanksgiving Day 1987, while her husband, <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON>, 27, took their children into the <LOCATION> Muskegon </LOCATION> foundry where he worked. He told her he wanted to pick up a Bible and show off his workplace to the children. As she waited, he placed <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>, 2, and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 15 months, in the hot foundry ladle, authorities said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> said earlier this month that she has had to deal with criticism over how she has handled the ordeal, forgiving her husband and ending divorce proceedings he initiated in April 1987. `` One of my friends told me if I stopped the divorce, I'd have the whole community against me,'' she said. `` But I could n't live with myself if I did. People who knew him before will understand.'' Some therapists also have suggested she was too understanding. `` One of the first counselors in <LOCATION> Ypsilanti </LOCATION> told me that I could n't ` just forgive' him,'' she said. `` I asked him, ` Why not?' I said, ` You're telling me I ca n't be a Christian? I ca n't forgive?''' Before the deaths, <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> had been diagnosed as a schizophrenic and paranoid, she said. `` He was n't taking his medicine -LRB- prescribed for schizophrenia and paranoia -RRB-,'' she said. `` That was it. That was it. We may end up having to move away from here, but I want him home. With me.'' She gave birth to their third son, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, in July. More than a year after the deaths, Mrs. <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> still is unable to call <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> by name. She refers to them as `` the kids.'' As difficult as the ordeal has been, it promises to intensify when her husband goes on trial next year on two counts of murder. His trial was to have started Nov. 29 but was postponed until January. <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> is confined in the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> for Forensic Psychiatry near <LOCATION> Ypsilanti </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON>'s court-appointed attorney, has said he will maintain <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> was innocent by reason of insanity.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> today urged immigrants to forget their prejudices and act like Australians after a 16-year-old Croatian boy was shot during a protest outside the Yugoslav consulate. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said newcomers have a right to demonstrate, but cautioned, `` We do not want to see <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> become a battleground in terms of people trying to live out and act out ancient rivalries that might still to some extent bedevil their places of origin.'' On Sunday, 1,500 ethnic Croatians demanding a homeland in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> demonstrated outside the Yugoslav consulate. Police said a security guard at the consulate shot and wounded the youth while about five protesters climbed the wall of the compound. In a separate demonstration earlier Sunday, about 2,000 protesters threw eggs and placards at a limosine carrying visiting Greek President <PERSON> Christo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON>. The protesters demanded <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> grant Macedonian autonomy. Police charged one demonstrator with assault. <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION>, an ancient kingdom in southeastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, is now a region divided among <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The Macedonian language is related to Greek. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> protested to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> over the demonstration, said <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>. The report from <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> said demonstrators entered the compound and tried to desecrate the national flag while police stood by. The shooting victim, wounded in the neck and throat, was listed in satisfactory condition at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincent </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, police said. The shooting occurred as protesters demanding a Croatian homeland marked Yugoslav National Day, the anniversary of the communist government. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> was proclaimed a nation on Nov. 29, 1945, with <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> as two of its six republics. In <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the Yugoslav capital, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said that in the absence of police intervention the consulate staff `` physically confronted the attackers.

 A hushed candlelight march by 15,000 people rekindled painful memories of the day 10 years ago when two leaders of the city's progressive political revolution were slain by a former colleague. Led by the doleful beat of five drummers, the procession followed the 1 -LCB- - mile route along which 40,000 people marched on Nov. 27, 1978, in a spontaneous outpouring of grief hours after Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Moscone </PERSON> and Supervisor <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Milk </PERSON> were shot to death Milk was the city's first openly homosexual elected official and a leader of the national gay rights movement. Hope rather than despair was the dominant mood Sunday night. `` Our purpose as a city 10 years after the deaths is to pledge that violence will not be the answer in our city,'' Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> told the crowd outside City Hall. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> ordered the doors to the building kept open through much of the night and invited marchers to observe a moment of silence in the rotunda. Describing Moscone and Milk as politicians who wanted to give all groups a voice in local government, <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> declared to wild cheers, `` The doors are open to honor them and you.'' A large black-and-white photograph of the two men was displayed inside the building, along with portions of The Names Quilt, made to honor those who have died of AIDS. Most victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have been homosexuals. `` The deaths of <LOCATION> Moscone </LOCATION> and Milk I think taught us how to deal with death, in the sense that we learned not to let grief defeat us,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, 31. `` It hurts to remember this, but we've learned, and it's really hit home with AIDS, we must all care for each other; that no one is a reject; everyone's part of the human race,'' he added. `` That's what <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is about. Folksinger <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baez </PERSON>, who had sung to the crowd on the steps of City Hall a decade ago, sang a folk song about the killing of a union activist, and the crowd cheered the line, `` ` I never died,' says he.'' Memorials for Milk also were scheduled in at least 10 cities nationwide for Sunday and today, including <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Former Supervisor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a conservative Catholic who had been a policeman and a firefighter, killed Moscone and Milk just before the populist mayor had planned to announce he would not reappoint <PERSON> White </PERSON> to the Board of Supervisors seat he had resigned 17 days earlier. Under pressure from Milk and his newly formed homosexual political machine, <PERSON> Moscone </PERSON> had planned to appoint a neighborhood activist instead, creating the first liberal majority on the 11-member commission. White escaped a first-degree murder charge and was convicted of involuntary manslaughter after defense lawyers, using what was called the `` Twinkie'' defense, convinced jurors that eating junk food had diminished White's mental capacity. The verdict triggered a riot by 5,000 people. <PERSON> White </PERSON> served five years of his 7-year, eight-month sentence. He committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage on Oct. 21, 1985, 19 months after getting out of prison.

 Helmeted policemen fired tear gas at bomb-throwing demonstrators outside <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> University today during a half-day general strike to demand the ouster of President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, witnesses said. At least five people, including a policemen, were injured by fragments from small homemade bombs, police said. Twenty people were arrested by the time the strike ended at 12 noon, police said on condition of anonymity. The strike was sponsored by two of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s main opposition groups as part of their year-long effort to force <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> to resign. Most stores failed to open, and cars stayed off the streets during the six-hour strike. The city of 6 million people was generally calm except around <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where police confronted roving bands of youths who threw stones, bricks and homemade bombs. Paramilitary troops from the <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> Rifles patrolled the streets in trucks. About 50 protesters hurled small bombs that generally exploded harmlessly in the street in front of the university's arts building, witnesses said. Police responded by firing at least a dozen tear gas shells to disperse the bomb-throwers, according to <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Alam </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON>, a photographer for the Bengali-language newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Ittefaq </ORGANIZATION>. The strike was called by <PERSON> Jamiaat-e-Islamic </PERSON>, a Moslem fundamentalist party, and a seven-party alliance led by <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The third main opposition group, an eight-party alliance headed by <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, did not join the strike but planned to hold rallies across the nation as part of a `` resistance day against the autocratic regime.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> put aside their personal differences a year ago to cooperate in an `` <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> must go campaign.'' Their series of often violent strikes failed to budge the former army general, leaving the opposition divided and fractious. The women blamed each other for the failure and have pursued separate protests. Rain helped ease the tension in the early hours of today's strike, with both protesters and police staying off the streets in large numbers Some people walked to work, since most public transport halted. A few state-run buses and some privately owned bicycle-powered rickshaws plied the streets. A senior official at the <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> Secretariat, the government's administrative center, said employee turnout at government offices and banks was thin in the early morning but increased later

<HEAD>President Says Her Government Is Stable Despite Failed Uprising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said today her government was stable despite what the military called a failed bid over the weekend to duplicate the mass uprising that toppled <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said troops and police blocked convoys late Saturday carrying about 1,000 civilians into <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. He speculated many were supporters of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, now in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said convoy leaders planned to surround military garrisons in the capital, much like the February 1986 `` people power'' uprising that ousted <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and propelled Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. Leaflets promised establishment of a `` constitutional military government,'' he said. Police said today five people remain in custody, facing charges of illegal assembly. Sedition charges were being prepared against the suspected organizer, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON>, who remained at large, authorities said. `` The situation now is normal,'' <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said. `` But the military is on alert to prevent any further attempt.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters she did not consider the incident a coup attempt. `` They were just making noises and they wanted to be noticed,'' she said. `` I guess people will keep on trying -LRB- to undermine her government -RRB-, but I think they should realize now that the people are against them and they will not support them in something like this.'' <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said leaflets confiscated from the convoy offered rewards of up to $ 200,000 for the capture of senior military officers who remained loyal to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` The armed forces of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is now taking over the government,'' <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said, reading fromn the leaflets. He said the participants appeared to be civilians and there was no evidence any soldiers joined the move. Oxales quoted participants as saying they were offered money to join the convoy and were told they would attend rallies at the presidential palace and elsewhere to protest `` economic grievances.'' Participants, mostly from agricultural areas near the capital, were also given `` liberation bonds'' that could supposedly be redeemed after the new government was installed, <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said. Authorities have foiled a half dozen coup attempts against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The most serious took place Aug. 28, 1987, when about 2,000 mutineers attacked military and media facilities in the capital. At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded, including Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s only son, <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Mutiny leader Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was arrested in December 1987 but escaped last April.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Cambodian Refugees Flee Shelling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Shelling along the Cambodian border has forced 5,000 Cambodian refugees back to a U.N.-sponsored camp from which they had been forcibly moved by communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, a Thai official said today. International aid officials on the Thai-Cambodian border said one report claimed there were hundreds of casualties, but that report could not be confirmed. No casualties have been taken to internationally-aided medical facilities, the officials said. The shelling is believed to have come from Vietnamese forces occupying <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> or forces of the Vietnamese-installed government in that country. The refugees fled the <LOCATION> Khao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phlu </LOCATION> area, in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s eastern <LOCATION> Trat </LOCATION> province about 3 -LCB- miles from the Cambodian border, after the artillery and rocket attacks peaked Nov. 15-19, said a <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> military officer who requested anonymity. They fled back to <LOCATION> Ta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luan </LOCATION>, a camp several miles west from which the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> had forcibly moved them, Thai military officers said. From Nov. 16-19, 249 artillery rounds crashed into the area, said an officer of the Eastern Chantaburi-Trat Field Force. Reporters visiting the <LOCATION> Trat </LOCATION> border last week could hear the sporadic boom of shelling in the jungled hills. Thai officers said today the shelling had ended. They said Thai authorities were working with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Border Relief Operation to help any Cambodians who may have been wounded. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the largest guerrilla group fighting the Vietnamese, moved the population from <LOCATION> Ta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luan </LOCATION> from June to September, leaving behind 1,000-2 ,000 disabled, elderly or sick people In a radical bid to fashion a new agrarian society, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded in late 1978. It moved the <LOCATION> Ta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luan </LOCATION> population apparently to try to populate areas just inside <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> that were evacuated by Vietnamese forces beginning last year. The international relief agencies and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have condemned the movements to <PERSON> Khao </PERSON> <PERSON> Phlu </PERSON>, a heavily mined, malarial region. Thai military officers said Thursday that fighting has picked up since early October, with shells striking six Thai border provinces. Fighting is expected to intensify further in the next few weeks with the approaching dry season. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has withdrawn some troops 19 miles from the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border area to ease tensions with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. But Lt. <PERSON> Patana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiranant </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chantaburi-Trat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Fresh units being sent in to free others near the -LRB- Thai-Cambodian -RRB- border would suggest <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s new readiness to engage in escalated fighting with the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance groups.''

 A longtime opponent of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>'s U.S.-backed military government said shots fired at him and three friends outside a restaurant here represented an assassination attempt `` I know that's true. I'm against the military dictatorship in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> and I've always stood for freedom and democracy. I have received death threats,'' <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alwazir </PERSON> said Sunday, adding that past attempts have been made on his life. `` The government spends a lot of money on terrorist attacks and they always follow people who are in opposition to the government.'' Police said they were looking for two men who were driving a black Cadillac, but they could n't determine the reason for Saturday night's attack. `` No motives have been established. We're still interviewing witnesses,'' said Police Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wysocki </PERSON>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, a country of about 5.9 million in the southwestern <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally. Its southern neighbor, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, has a pro-Soviet government. Telephone calls to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yemen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were unanswered Sunday. Gunfire from a passing car missed <PERSON> Alwazir </PERSON> but a companion, <PERSON> Naji </PERSON> <PERSON> Isa </PERSON>, 30, was shot in the left leg. He remained in serious but stable condition at <LOCATION> Oakwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> early today, a nursing supervisor said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckelman </PERSON>, who was near the restaurant shortly before the shooting, said a man drove past and scrutinized him. `` He said to a man with him, ` He's not the one,''' <PERSON> Heckelman </PERSON> said. Minutes later, <PERSON> Heckelman </PERSON> said, he saw the man start shooting. <PERSON> Alwazir </PERSON>, 56, was entering the restaurant for an informal meeting during his three-day visit to the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area from his home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> is home to many in the area's large Arab community.

<HEAD>Central Committee Convenes To Consider Government Restructuring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Central Committee, the policy-making body of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, convened today to consider proposals for revamping the central government's relationship to the 15 Soviet republics. Critics say such revisions, which come after weeks of controversy over proposed constitutional amendments, would concentrate too much power in the Kremlin. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was delivering a report to the 300-member body, but gave no further details. The Central Committee meeting, known as a plenum, is a prelude to Tuesday's meeting of the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, but it is not known whether it will take up the issue of ethnic unrest now sweeping the southern republics of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. At least six people died in protests there last week. The news agency said the party meeting is considering `` measures to effect political reform in state development,'' but made no mention of the unease in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>. The proposed constitutional changes have stirred controversy particularly in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>, where the Estonian parliament on Nov. 16 declared the republic `` sovereign'' and claimed authority to conduct its own business except in regard to foreign policy and defense. The parliaments in neighboring <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> stopped short of approving similar measures, but activists there still oppose more centralized power and are agitating for defeat of the constitutional changes. In addition, thousands in the southern republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> have protested the proposed amendments and many have expressed support for <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s action. Soviet newspapers have contained numerous letters objecting to proposals that readers say could produce a dictator. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appeared at a Saturday meeting of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and pronounced the <LOCATION> Estonian </LOCATION> action unconstitutional, saying it `` must be rejected as mistaken, not having any legal force.'' He said the Presidium, which is the nation's highest executive body, had made several changes. None of the reports has given details of the revised plan, but a special legislative commission recommended conciliatory language to remove some of the most oft-stated objections. The news agency said the Presidium ordered development of a system to widen and protect the rights of the 15 republics that make up the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the system would `` secure the political, social and economic interests of the constituent republics and broaden and uphold their sovereign rights in the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republics </ORGANIZATION>.'' The current law theoretically provides a mechanism for republics to secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s hold has been too strong for any republic to consider exercising that provision. The draft constitutional amendments would eliminate the provision altogether. The latest round of violence in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> has resulted in at least six deaths, firebombings and reported beatings. Soviet soldiers have cordoned off Armenian districts within <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> cities. Ethnic fighting in the area began in February over control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region, which is populated mainly by Armenians but lies within <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s borders.

<HEAD>EPA Plan For Bruin Lagoon Cleanup Questioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUIN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A congressional office and the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> are divided over the adequacy of cleanup plans for one of the nation's worst toxic waste dumps with work set to begin in a few months. Under the plan drawn up by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, a contractor is to dig out highly acidic sludge in the four-acre Bruin lagoon 45 miles north of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, mix it with lime and soil to neutralize and immobilize it, and then bulldoze it back in place. `` It was our feeling this would be just as protective of human health as other measures and would be less expensive,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Germann </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s Region 3 headquarters in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` It can be a permanent remedy, insofar as it can prevent hazardous substances from reaching the public into the forseeable future.'' But some independent experts say the cleanup method chosen for the old oil refinery dump is a short-term, low-cost and low-technology effort. They say a more permanent solution would be appropriate for what is listed as No. 3 on the government's priority list of 1,175 Superfund hazardous waste sites. `` Over the short term, it may limit movement of materials from the site,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON>, a senior associate for the <ORGANIZATION> congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, who reviews the effectiveness of Superfund cleanups. `` In the long term, all such capping and cover systems break down, and water will get in. Continued money will have to be put in that site, and any lapse in vigilance will cause problems,'' he said. The lagoon is filled with a highly acidic sludge that has the consistency of soft asphalt. It is composed of oils, grease, other petroleum byproducts, solvents and toxic metals, and it is saturated with several organic compounds and a termite pesticide in concentrations far above the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s drinking water standard. More than 30 homes stand within 500 feet of the lagoon. Pollutants from the dump have not shown up in the wells of nearby homes so far, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has found. Work on the site is expected to begin next spring and last a year. It will cost up to $ 5 million, with the federal Superfund, a pool of money from petroleum and chemical industries and large manufacturers, paying 90 percent of the cleanup costs. The state will pay the rest and will maintain the site after the first year. Bruin residents not only consider the plan sufficient, they say any cleanup is a waste of money that draws unfavorable publicity to their town. `` We do n't worry. We've lived with it all our lives. We knew that's a place you do n't go near,'' said <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON>, who lives within a few hundred yards of the lagoon and whose childhood dog had to be shot when it got stuck in the sludge. `` I do n't care if they do anything or not,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Moser </PERSON>, whose back yard borders the dump. `` We lived here all our lives and it never bothered anybody. They could have bought the town for the money they spent.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> said today that 429 bodies were recovered from storm-ravaged villages of southern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> in the country's worst natural disaster in decades. `` We need aid from foreign countries,'' he said after an emergency Cabinet meeting. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> provided initial assistance today with relief checks totaling $ 43,400. Floods and mudslides from a week of heavy rains starting Nov. 19 struck 12 southern provinces. Dozens of people are still buried in the mud, <ORGANIZATION> Chatichai </ORGANIZATION> said. More than 380 people remain missing and 2,050 others were injured, said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Kitti </PERSON> <PERSON> Rattanachaya </PERSON>, deputy commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> in the south. The same weather system that battered southern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> moved through <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> a few days earlier, killing 31 people and forcing tens of thousands from their homes. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> said the flooding and mudslides affected about 600,000 people, destroyed 7,000 houses and caused $ 120 million in damage. <PERSON> Kitti </PERSON> said 16 helicopters were dropping food and medicine to isolated villages. Hundreds of troopers were sent to clear routes to transport emergency supplies to the villages, he said. Many of the dead were in villages in <LOCATION> Nakhon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thammarat </LOCATION> province, where mud and thousands of logs cascaded down hillsides left barren by illegal logging, slamming into houses and crushing people. Chatichai today ordered a search for the poachers responsible, but little has been done despite repeated promises by successive Thai governments to control the problem, which involves widespread official corruption. Today, the British Minister for Construction, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Trippier </PERSON>, told Thai Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was providing $ 90,500 in immediate assistance. He presented <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> a check for $ 18,400 and said urgent steps would be taken to transfer the remainder. `` This is an appalling tragedy, which has shocked and saddened the British government,'' Trippier said. Also today, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donohue </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> a check for $ 25,000 in emergency aid and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would provide $ 40,000 more. The additional aid was recommended by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> team that flew to the ravaged areas Saturday. In a related development, officials in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> said the situation there was rapidly improving with flood waters subsiding and only about 10,600 storm victims still in relief centers.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said ethnic strife is threatening his program of economic and social reforms, and he said restructuring is the cure for the violence, not the cause. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was reacting to a wave of nationalist unrest that has swept across the country from the Baltic republics in the northwest to the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> in the southwest. In a related development, the policy-making body of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, met today to review proposals for revamping the central government's relationship to the 15 Soviet republics. Official media said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was delivering a report today to the 300-member body, but no further details were available. Among the draft proposals before the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are constitutional amendments that critics say would concentrate too much power in the Kremlin and eliminate the legal possibility for republics to secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a speech broadcast on state television Sunday that `` attempts are being made to kindle dislike in the interethnic sphere.'' `` This would be disastrous, it would put perestroika in jeopardy,'' he said, referring to his reform campaign. `` It would even make some people think that it is, perhaps, perestroika that is to blame for all that.'' He said his policy of opening up information and opinion is the solution to ethnic tension, which exists in many of the 15 Soviet republics. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks come during violent tensions between the neighboring southern republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and during demands for increased autonomy in the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. He made his speech Saturday before the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's top executive body. Saturday's session of the Presidum struck down an Estonian declaration of limited sovereignty made earlier this month, official media reported. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> declared then that it had the right to veto Soviet laws. Official media said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged before the Presidium that national constitutional amendments he has proposed may have angered Estonians and others by curtailing local rule. But his remarks Saturday also carried a veiled warning. `` I must say we receive a great number of letters from working people in every republic with remarks that we are at times too tolerant with regard to extremists,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> on Sunday, two <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials were reported fired. Soviet newspapers charged that local authorities were not helping soldiers halt the ethnic violence in the republic. Rallies of up to 500,000 people were reported Sunday in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, the republic's capital. The military newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said local officials are not helping troops trying to keep the clashing Azerbaijanis and Armenians apart in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Kirovabad </LOCATION>. At least seven people were killed and 160 injured in <LOCATION> Kirovabad </LOCATION> in last week's violence between the mainly Christian Armenians and <PERSON> Moslem </PERSON> <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON>, reports have said. A duty officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in the city of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> denied charges that local authorities were not helping the military quell the violence, saying `` The party is in control.'' He refused to give his name. Ethnic fighting between Azerbaijanis and Armenians first began in February and culminated in last week's massive demonstrations. The Armenians, who dominate the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, are demanding that it be annexed to neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that building materials were being removed from a construction site for an Armenian workshop and recreation center in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s Topkhan Natural Preserve. The official news agency said the construction of the center at an Armenian-controlled aluminum factory contributed to last week's unrest.

<HEAD>Worker Compensation Official Rules that Judge Died of Overwork</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge's widow was awarded $ 21,000 a year in workers' compensation by a commissioner who ruled her husband died of overwork and stress from his numerous state tasks. Commissioner <PERSON> Rhoda </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> ruled recently that <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>'s fatal heart attack two years ago was caused by stress and overwork from the legion of jobs he performed for the state <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. She described <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> as `` the epitome of the work ethic.'' `` I would rather have my husband than the money,'' said <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> `` That means nothing to me. ... He was a very self-sacrificing person, and we always got along on very little.'' <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>, who served 14 years on the bench, died in September 1986 at the age of 54. At the time, <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> served as presiding criminal judge and administrative judge for the New Haven Judicial District, administrative judge for state criminal courts, chairman of a panel on grand juries and chairman of a commission on alternative sentencing. Chief Court Administrator <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ment </PERSON>, a witness at the compensation hearing, said that after <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>'s death, it was decided that no one judge would ever again be asked to assume so many jobs for the department. <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>'s ruling marked the first time in state history that a judge was found entitled to benefits under the Workers Compensation Law, said <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackall </PERSON>, the assistant state attorney general who opposed the claim. The state, which is appealing, had argued that judges are appointed officials who do not fit the compensation law's definition of employees. <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> awarded Mrs. <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> a stipend of $ 408 a week for life, retroactive to her husband's death. She was already receiving $ 20,000 a year from her husband's pension benefits.

<TEXT>
 Afghan resistance leaders and top Soviet representatives will meet in the next week to discuss exchanging prisoners, the withdrawal of Soviet troops and postwar <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a rebel spokesman said today. The Soviets on Sunday held their first direct talks with Moslem insurgents over the exchange of prisoners of war since <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops began withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in May. The rebels have offered as a `` goodwill gesture'' to exchange four Soviet prisoners of war for 100 guerrillas, said <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmood </PERSON> of the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> group. He said the offer was made at the meeting but the Soviets did not respond. Guerrilla spokesmen <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ghairat </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahir </PERSON>, representing two rebel groups, met four Soviet embassy officials, including naval and air attache Col. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Belyi </PERSON>, at the Pakistani Foreign Ministry. <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>, of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> rebel group, said the Soviets wanted talks split between military issues, specifically prisoners of war, and problems such as the political makeup of a postwar <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> refused to divulge details except to say a high-level meeting `` will be outside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> ... within the next week.'' The rebels and the Soviets refused to say whether the prisoner exchange meeting ended with any commitment on the release of all or part of some 300 soldiers <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has said are missing in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> said the Soviet delegation wants specifics on prisoners being held by the guerrillas, and `` we were trying to tell them there are other issues of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, not only prisoners of wars.'' `` They are talking about peace and in the meantime they are bringing in new weapons,'' said <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> introduced MiG-27 fighter jets and surface-to-surface Scud missiles into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in October despite its pledge to remove its forces by Feb. 15. `` We hope this meeting will convince them to start to speed up the withdrawal and stop the escalation of the war,'' said <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>. The Soviets were promised `` that any move seen from the Russian side will be matched by movement from the mujahedeen,'' or guerrillas, <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> said. Makeup of the rebel contingent to meet with the Soviets has yet to be decided, although <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> said <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, the current spokesman of the loose, guerrilla alliance, would meet alone or head a delegation. <PERSON> Nickolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Portikov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION>'s political section refused to confirm or deny the impending meeting. `` I am not going to make any specific statements on the future,'' he said. Today's talks ended only `` with a promise that there will be a continuation of meetings,'' <PERSON> Portikov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> said the Soviet representative had not been decided either, but he speculated the job might go to <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister. <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmood </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> was appointed ambassador to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> `` just for the purpose of talking to the mujahedeen.'' `` There is no other need for such a powerful man to be ambassador in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he said. In the past month, Soviet statements from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have warned that stepped up attacks by U.S.-backed guerrillas threaten to derail a withdrawal of Soviet troops. In an agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last April, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> promised to withdraw an estimated 100,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> from May 15 to Feb. 15. Half left by Aug. 15 and despite strongly worded warnings by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, it promised to meet the February deadline.

<TEXT>
 Rival Shiite Moslem militias resumed fighting today, killing five people and wounding 15 others in clashes despite a Syrian shoot-to-kill threat, police said. Gunmen of the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, fought for 40 minutes before dawn around the Iranian Embassy in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seaside <LOCATION> Jnah </LOCATION> district, authorities said. Police said two people were killed and six wounded. Syrian peacekeeping troops then intervened and halted the flare-up. Three other people were killed and seven wounded in a 20-minute mortar duel shortly after midnight in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, police said. The new casualties raised the total to 40 killed and 87 wounded since the latest <ORGANIZATION> Amal-Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> confrontation resumed Wednesday. The command of the Syrian army's 12,000-man contingent in charge of security in west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> set a 1 p.m. deadline Sunday for the warring militiamen to withdraw from the streets. `` The Syrian army has orders to shoot on sight any gunman on the streets in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the southern suburbs after the deadline,'' the ultimatum said. Police said the Syrians have not yet opened fire despite the violations. The leftist daily <ORGANIZATION> As-Safir </ORGANIZATION> said today the Syrian command was seeking to disarm the militias in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and then deal with the southern slums. The newspaper quoted an unidentified high-ranking <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> security source as saying <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> will take `` radical measures, least of which is the disarmament of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the expulsion of the combatants.'' `` Then, we will deal firmly with the situation in the southern suburbs,'' the source was quoted as saying. As-Safir did not elaborate. The Syrian army that intervened in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> since has made several futile attempts to disarm the militias and end the nation's 13-year civil war. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could not disarm the militias when it invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982 to dislodge <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s guerrillas from their main <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> power base. A multinational peace force that involved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines and French, Italian and British troops also failed to restore stability to the capital in a 17-month duty that started in September 1982 after the Israelis withdrew from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

 Leaders of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc gave Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> approval today to make a major concession to lure the rival <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> into a governing coalition, party leaders said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was scheduled to meet Labor leader and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> today to discuss the proposals, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. Such a meeting could be a major step toward forming a broad-based government similar to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. The 10 <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> ministers decided at a two-hour meeting to offer Labor two powerful Cabinet jobs, defense minister and either the finance or foreign portfolio, said Welfare Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsav </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> earlier refused to concede more than the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to the left-leaning Labor. The turnabout came after <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s negotiations with seven smaller parties bogged down in conflicting demands for Cabinet posts `` We all believe we should build a government under own leadership, a government that will lead the country with our strength,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the ministers, according to a party statement. `` But because we are not only concerned with party interests but for the country's general welfare, from this standpoint a broad-based government is preferable,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. Labor broke off talks with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> last week after <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> refused to reach a power-sharing agreement. But <PERSON> Katzav </PERSON> said after today's meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leaders: `` Now we can be more open. We are ready to give two ministries which we were previously not ready to.'' The ministers, however, made no decision about what foreign policy a joint government would have. Israeli news reports said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would insist that <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> be barred from openly advocating an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. Labor legislator <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Eliezer </PERSON> said on army radio the two parties could find common ground with a proposal for a four-year autonomy plan for Palestinians in the occupied territories pending negotiation of a final settlement. <PERSON> Ben-Eliezer </PERSON> also said a joint government was needed to break a lengthy stalemate in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace contacts. `` Without a Likud-Labor agreement there are no possibilities for this,'' he said. During the election campaign, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> called for trading land for peace and negotiating under the umbrella of an international conference. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rejected any territorial compromise and urged direct talks aimed at granting the Palestinians limited autonomy. In the Nov. 1 elections, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> edged Labor 40 to 39 in the 120-seat Parliament. The rest went to small parties, with the 18 seats won by ultra-Orthodox religious parties making them possible kingmakers in a right-wing coaltion. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s decision today left the door open for the party to form a government with religious and right-wing factions, the party statement said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> met today with members of four small parties, the Torah Guardians, <PERSON> Degel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatorah </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

They show that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> showered his staff and family alike with memos signed `` The President'' and often referred to himself as `` RN.'' After more than a decade of battling to keep some of his memos from the public, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> relented last year and did not object to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> releasing the majority of the documents. Some examples: June 16, 1969, to Domestic Affairs Assistant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>: `` On an urgent basis I need the press list before the press conference on Thursday. I intend to start ... calling on those pressmen who are not anti rather than constantly calling on those who are trying to give us the hook.'' Jan. 9, 1970, to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>: `` What is the situation with regard to the horrible modern art in some of our embassies? I realize we ca n't censor this stuff, but I would like a report as to what embassies have some of these atrocious objects.'' March 16, 1970, to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> assistant H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON>: `` Would you please have the <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION> years checked? I know that'59 is an excellent year, even with my unsophisticated taste; but my recollection is that'66 is one of the poor years. The reason I ask is that we seem to have a huge stock of'66 <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION> on hand, and I wondered why.'' June 15, 1971, to <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> -LRB- marked EYES ONLY -RRB-: `` In view of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> irresponsibility and recklessness in deliberately printing classified documents -LRB- the Pentagon Papers -RRB- without regard to the national interest. ... Until further notice under no circumstances is anyone connected with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to give any interview to ... The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> without my express permission. I want you to enforce this without, of course, showing them this memorandum.'' July 24, 1972, to daughters <PERSON> Tricia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julie </PERSON>: `` It occurs to me that from time to time you may be asked for anecdotes which would relate to some of the political events that have occurred over the years. ... On a personal side, you might mention some of our Christmas parties when I played the piano for group singing, etc., always by ear. ... You can say that these kinds of events are not publicly known, but they have been part of the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> story that is to you most heartwarming.'' Memos from <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s aides also were among the documents, for example: Feb. 9, 1971, from <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> deputy <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>: `` In seating at <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dinners </ORGANIZATION>, the President feels that <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> -RRB- should not always be put next to the most glamorous woman present.''

 A judicial committee ordered President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s eldest son released from jail during an inquiry into the slaying of one of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s bodyguards. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> ordered establishment of the judicial committee last week. He said his 25-year-old son <PERSON> Odai </PERSON>, killed the bodyguard, <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hana </PERSON> <PERSON> Gegeo </PERSON>, on Oct. 18. <PERSON> Odai </PERSON> was jailed three days after the killing. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said today that he was freed Sunday night. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported the three-man judicial committee investigating <PERSON> Odai </PERSON> had ordered Sunday that he be freed without bail on condition he appear for questioning later. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said the committee referred the case to a criminal tribunal. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Odai </PERSON> hit <PERSON> Gegeo </PERSON> with a wooden bat because he refused to stop shooting at a party near the presidential palace. The bodyguard died at a hospital several hours later. The president said <PERSON> Odai </PERSON> tried to commit suicide after learning of <PERSON> Gegeo </PERSON>'s death. He tried to take his life twice more while in prison, but was saved by doctors, according to his father. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has refused clemency petitions for his son, including one from the victim's father, who reportedly is the president's cook. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has ordered a general amnesty pardoning all political prisoners, except spies. <PERSON> Odai </PERSON>'s release was not linked to the amnesty. Addressing a group of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> lawyers gathered for a seminar in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said today: `` Every convicted political prisoner or fugitive sought for political reasons is hereby pardoned, be he in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> or abroad, except for those who spied for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its army.'' He did not say when the prisoners will be freed, nor give the reason for the amnesty. It also was not immediately clear how many prisoners and fugitives would be affected.

 <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said today a visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by its director-general, <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON>, was not authorized by the Israeli government. <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Sunday to meet with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s consular delegation, is the highest-ranking Israeli to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> cut ties with the Jewish state after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON>'s 36-hour visit was not scheduled to include meetings with Soviet leaders, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said the trip was not cleared with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> or other government leaders and has provoked angry reactions. `` Mr. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was n't happy. He was very surprised,'' one <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` We only heard about this visit shortly after Mr. <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON> took off.'' <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON> was first reported headed for <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. But he turned up in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, traveling on a tourist visa, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` He apparently thought there was no need to coordinate it because it was a visit of a technical nature ... but not everyone in the ministry agreed with this view,'' the official said. Another Foreign Ministry source said <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON>'s action could put <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into an uncomfortable position with the Soviets. `` It could be quite embarrassing if the Soviets thought the trip was coordinated,'' the official said. He said the feeling in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> was that <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON>, who is expected to leave his post shortly, had taken the action to generate headlines. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sent a five-member delegation to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in July, a year after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent a consular delegation to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Leaders Meet to Review Economic Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s Communist leaders met in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> today to review the country's economic plans until the year 2000, the official Agerpres news agency reported. The three-day plenary meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Commmunist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, chaired by leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, `` will establish action for fulfillment of the country's economic and social development programs, evaluate the current situation in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and specify the political and organizational measures for the future work of the party,'' the report said. <PERSON> Agerpres </PERSON> did not say why the meeting, originally scheduled for September, was delayed for two months. Western observers suggested the delay may have been caused partly by mounting international criticism of the government's scheme to destroy thousands of Romanian villages in order to gain more farmland for state-owned collective farms. According to the plan, made public in April, some 7,000 villages in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> are to be razed and their residents resettled in new housing in so-called agro-industrial centers. The scheme has met harsh criticism from Western governments and from neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which fears the ethnic traditions of 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> will be destroyed. Romanian officials recently have appeared to back off from the original plan, saying fewer villages would be demolished. Another reason for the delay in the meeting may have been continued food and energy shortages. Western visitors to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> say such shortages have worsened in recent months. Even bread was hard to find in the capital for a week in July, Romanians and Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> said. Last month, the Communist government announced new energy rations as the country's population of 23 million prepared for a fifth straight winter of restrictions and hardships. The decree stipulated that centrally controlled heating systems in the apartment blocks where most urban Romanians live not operate more than four hours on workdays and five hours on Sundays. Over the past four winters, Romanians have experienced drastic heating and lighting cuts, including daily power cuts lasting from two to eight hours.

<TEXT>
 A black nationalist leader freed after 12 years in prison today challenged the government to lift its ban on his movement and release all jailed activists, including <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. `` Long live the <ORGANIZATION> Pan-Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' chanted supporters of the outlawed organization as <PERSON> Zeph </PERSON> <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON>, its ailing 75-year-old president, arrived for his first news conference since his release Saturday. The government said it freed him unconditionally on humanitarian grounds. For years, <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON>'s group has been at odds ideologically with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Both organizations use armed resistance against the white-led government. But the Pan-Africanists favor black self-reliance, while <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s larger organization supports a multiracial approach. <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON> took a conciliatory approach. `` My first task, which I am going to do everything in my powers to discharge, is to unite the African people,'' he said. `` We do n't look at the color of a person _ we consider his convictions.'' In calling for the release of all political prisoners, <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON> mentioned <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Masemola </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pan-Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader. `` I am naming them as symbols of all other prisoners of conscience who should be out here and working for the return of our land,'' <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON> said. `` They should be released not on the grounds of compassion or mercy, but because they are held illegitimately.'' For several months <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON> has been seriously ill with cancer, but he said he would remain politically active. `` I issue a direct challenge to -LRB- President P.W. -RRB- <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Let him unban the PAC and all other political organizations.'' <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON> urged foreign governments to intensify economic, cultural and sporting boycotts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> until the government made major political concessions. Currently, the black majority has no vote in national affairs. He declined to assess political changes during his imprisonment, when the government claims many reforms. But he said, `` I am calling on the international community not to be fooled by cosmetic change. `` The only item we are prepared to negotiate is the return of the land and the wealth to its rightful owners.'' A former teacher, <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON> advised <PERSON> black </PERSON> students to think carefully about using classroom boycotts as a political tactic. `` Use the schools wisely as an arena for the struggle,'' he said, wishing students good luck in examinations. The simultaneous, unconditional releases of <LOCATION> Mothopeng </LOCATION> and longtime <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON>, 69, were the latest in a series of government moves apparently aimed at improving <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s international standing. In the span of a week, the government: _ Announced <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> would not return to prison when he completes his recovery from tuberculosis at a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> hospital. Officials said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> will remain in custody at a `` suitable'' location, possibly a private home on prison grounds. _ Granted clemency with lengthy jail terms to the <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>, a group of blacks sentenced to hang for complicity in a 1984 mob killing. _ Endorsed a regional peace plan to grant independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today signed an extension of their long-term grain agreement, providing for the Soviets to purchase more than 20 million tons of grain and soybeans. Ambassador <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, the deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, said the agreement extends the grain agreement by two years and three months _ until the end of 1990. The previous agreement expired Sept. 30. Under the agreement, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is obligated to purchase 4 million metric tons of corn, 4 million metric tons of wheat and 1 million metric tons of corn, wheat or soybeans a year at prevailing market prices, <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON> said. He said those were the same figures included in the previous agreement. The agreement also was announced at a <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> news briefing by spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. Negotiations on the new agreement began in March in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and the signing today by <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON> and Soviet Deputy Foreign Economic Relations Minister <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Chumakov </PERSON> concluded the sixth round of talks. `` We found the Soviets very business-like and constructive throughout the negotiations,'' <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON> said by telephone. Negotiations will begin at a time not determined yet on an agreement to follow the new accord, he said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s grain harvest this year, although not officially announced, is expected to be slightly smaller than the 210 million metric tons harvested in each of the past two years. Much of the country's prime grain-growing land was affected by a severe drought this summer. Those figures are much higher than the 1981-1985 annual figure of about 185 million metric tons, but far below Soviet targets. The 1986 target was 232 million tons and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is trying to boost production to 250 million metric tons. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is trying to reform agriculture by giving families and farm workers more responsibility and the opportunity for greater earnings. The Soviet leader hopes to encourage farmers to work harder by offering them a chance to earn more money and live better.

Residents of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> El-Khadr </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> said soldiers had imposed a curfew on the village and were razing several houses. An army official could not confirm the report but said: `` I know there are house demolitions today. We will have the details later.'' The army said one house was demolished Sunday in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoun </LOCATION>. It said the house belonged to <PERSON> Yazid </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahi </PERSON>, who was arrested and accused of leading an outlawed committee and of taking part in a firebomb attack on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops.

Two teen-agers and a 20-year-old man suffered bullet wounds in the clash with soldiers in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, officials at <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said. One of the victims was a 17-year-old shot in the stomach, they said.

At least 316 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed during the uprising, which began Dec. 8.

<TEXT>
 For the second time this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to grant husbands legal power to prevent their wives from having an abortion. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> man who sought unsuccessfully last summer to stop his then-estranged wife from ending her pregnancy. The justices also turned down a companion appeal by a court-appointed guardian of the fetus. The justices on Nov. 14 declined to hear arguments in a similar appeal by an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> man. In the case acted on today, <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> attempted to block an abortion for his then-estranged wife, <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON>. She was granted a divorce on Oct. 24. She accused <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of physically abusing her, refusing to contribute financially or otherwise to the support of the household and abandoning her and the couple's infant son, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 25, a school custodian, went to court last summer to block Ms. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' from having an abortion after he learned she had become pregnant during the couple's brief reconciliation last July. Court orders barred her from having the abortion for seven weeks until a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> appeals court allowed her to go ahead with the operation. She had the abortion in October. The appeals court cited the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s famous 1973 ruling, <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, which legalized abortion nationwide, and a 1976 high court ruling that struck down a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law requiring spousal consent for a wife's abortion. `` Although the issue of abortion raises important moral questions, such questions are not applicable to the decision here,'' the appeals court said. Judges `` must apply the law of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Constitution as announced by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' Lawyers for <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the appeals court ruling `` unconstitutionally deprived the father of his unborn child by sanctioning abortion on demand.'' The cases are <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 88-555, and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 88-683.

 <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> still clutched his `` tornado pillow'' hours after killer storms ripped through the <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> area today, killing five people and injuring about 150 others. The tornadoes scoured a five-mile path through the heavily populated northern section of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s capital city and its suburbs before leaping to neighboring counties. Along the way, the tornadoes ripped up <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON>'s town house. `` It sounded like a rush of water, followed by a bunch of shaking,'' <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> said. `` The roof was totally gone, the patio doors were gone and every window was smashed. The carpet was rolled up like someone was going to replace it.'' <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON>, 34, grabbed a pillow and got behind his bedroom door. He still held the pillow during an interview at a shelter in a central Raleigh school. Forty-six people stayed at the shelter after the storms hit between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. `` If you felt a big, hot hair dryer blowing by you and the whole place was shaking apart and if this -LRB- pillow -RRB- was the only thing that protected your face, you'd hold onto it,'' <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> said, calling it his `` tornado pillow.'' `` I had to dig my way out'' from the corner of the room, he said. `` I was kind of buried in rubble. In fact, I later found plaster in my ears.'' <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> left his town house wearing only pajamas. He borrowed clothes from neighbors _ a pink jacket from one, gray sweatpants from another and socks from someone at the shelter. He still was without shoes. Residents of the complex where he lived were told to evacuate because of a gas leak. Mayor <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Upchurch </PERSON> said at midmorning that the danger of gas leaks had passed. <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> and others were n't allowed to drive out because of the leak, so they walked and waited for buses to take them to the shelter. Elsewhere, when the sun rose, dazed residents emerged to survey the destruction. `` My God, my God,'' said <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprankel </PERSON>, as she stood on a ridge for a sweeping view of her town house subdivision and an adjacent apartment complex in north <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Sprankle </PERSON> said she had lived eight years in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and was accustomed to tornado watches and warnings but had never experienced one. `` They used to tell me it's like a freight train coming, but what it's really like is a train on top of you,'' she said. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> surveyed her two-story town house by candle light before sunrise. A large pine tree had slammed into her roof and its top protruded through the ceiling into a bedroom. `` My insurance company is going to love this,'' she said. `` One month, I've been here just one month. I ca n't believe it.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> gasped in disbelief when he saw that a section of his town house roof was gone. `` I did n't need to see that,'' <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said. `` What a way to end the Thanksgiving weekend.''

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Jewish Group Display Menorah at Pittsburgh
Building</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to let a Jewish organization display a menorah, symbolizing the Hanukkah holiday, on the steps of a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> government building next month. The justices, by an 8-1 vote, turned down an emergency request aimed at allowing display of the 18-foot menorah. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> was the lone vote to allow the display. The court agreed in October to decide whether displaying the menorah at the City-County Building and a Christmas nativity scene at a nearby government building violate the constitutionally required separation of church and state. That decision is expected by July. But lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Chabad </ORGANIZATION>, the Jewish organization that owns the menorah, asked the justices to set aside a federal appeals court's order that bars its display pending the high court's review The menorah had been displayed each year since 1982. The nativity scene depicting the birth of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> has been displayed inside the main entrance of the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> for about six weeks during the Christmas season since 1981. A federal trial judge refused to order the dismantling of the displays when they were challenged last Christmas. But the 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled, by a 2-1 vote, that the displays unlawfully promote religion. The nativity scene, or creche, is owned by the Holy Name Society, a Roman Catholic men's group. It has not sought emergency action that would allow display of the creche during the Christmas season this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 allowed communities nationwide to include nativity scenes and other religious symbols in officially sponsored holiday displays. In that ruling, the justices let <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, officials place a creche in a Christmas display because such decorations as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>, reindeer and snowmen also were included. But lower courts since have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow one, and have disallowed various government-sponsored Christmas displays deemed too religious. The case is Chabad vs. <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, A-384.

<HEAD>Deficit Falls For 3rd Straight Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit shrank by 5.4 percent from July through September, the third consecutive quarterly decline, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the imbalance between imports and exports narrowed to $ 28.5 billion in the year's third quarter. It was the lowest quarterly deficit since the first quarter of 1985 and reflected the continued improvement the country has enjoyed in trade this year. The decline followed a revised 14.3 percent narrowing in the second quarter, when it shrank to $ 30.15 billion. In the first three months of the year, the deficit had fallen by 14.6 percent. For the first nine months of this year, the trade deficit has been running at an annual rate of $ 125.2 billion, down 22 percent from the record deficit of $ 160.3 billion in 1987. Economists believe this trend will hold for the final three months of the year, marking the first annual improvement in the country's trade balance since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981. The new figures confirmed an improvement already evident in the department's monthly merchandise trade reports. Those figures showed the deficit declining by 3.2 percent to $ 32.2 billion in the third quarter, compared to $ 33.2 billion in the second quarter. Today's figures are smaller because they subtract such factors as shipping costs and military sales from the monthly numbers. The new report said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports climbed 3.4 percent to $ 82.3 billion. It was the seventh consecutive quarterly increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales abroad and pushed exports to a record level. Imports also rose, but by a smaller 0.9 percent to $ 110.8 billion as a drop in oil shipments helped offset a rise in non-petroleum imports. The average number of barrels of oil imported daily rose to 7.54 million, up from 7.4 million. However, the average price of a barrel of oil fell from $ 15.16 to $ 14.22. The price drop helped to narrow the country's foreign oil bill by 4 percent to $ 9.9 billion in the third quarter. Offsetting the decline in oil imports were widespread increases in car shipments. Foreign car shipments from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> climbed by 12 percent while the number of passenger cars from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> increased 34 percent. Car imports from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were up 29 percent and Japanese shipments rose 16 percent. The average price of a Japanese car edged down by 1 percent while the price of West German cars dropped a sharp 18 percent after posting big gains for several quarters. Most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export categories showed increases. Sales of farm produce rose 8 percent to $ 10.4 billion, the highest level since the second quarter of 1982. The increase was more than accounted for by higher prices, reflecting the drought in the farm belt. Corn exports increased 48 percent and total soybean sales were up 49 percent. The average price of corn rose by 30 percent while soybean prices were up 28 percent and wheat prices rose 25 percent. As usual, the largest deficit was recorded with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an increase of $ 100 million to $ 12 billion for the quarter.

<HEAD>Court Allows New York Prosecutors to Use Union Membership Lists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today allowed prosecutors investigating labor union corruption in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to use subpoenaed membership lists obtained from four carpenters union locals. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the rights of the union and its members were not violated by forcing the locals to turn over the lists. A <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> grand jury in February 1987 issued subpoenas for the membership lists of Locals 17, 135, 257 and 608 in connection with a probe of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carpenters </ORGANIZATION> and Joiners by District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last July that <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>'s office could keep the lists pending completion of the grand jury investigation The state court said forcing the unions to turn over the lists and allowing the district attorney to keep them for now did not violate free-association rights of the union and its members. The union was forced to turn over the names, addresses, home telephone and social security numbers for some 10,000 members. The state court noted that the investigation is aimed primarily at high-ranking union officials. But it said some rank and file members may also become targets. `` The membership lists have a substantial relation to the investigation because they will enable the grand jury to locate and identify union members, the potential witnesses for grand jury testimony, without unduly burdening or delaying the search and without having to proceed through the traditional channels of first notifying the union leaders and exposing witnesses to possible intimidation,'' the state court said. The state court added that if the subpoenas were narrowed to include only some union members, job sites or locals it `` would immediately signal the suspected parties.'' Also, the state court said, a more restricted subpoena would make it hard for prosecutors to uncover possible witnesses to illegal activities, such as bribe-taking. The union said the subpoena will chill the rights of members because carpenters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> will assume a connection between being a union member and being called before the grand jury. That perception will deter people from joining the union and discourage members from attending union meetings and engaging in robust debate with other members, the union said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Brooklyn-based <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also have been investigating the carpenters union in a probe begun in 1984 of the construction industry in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area. The investigation has produced numerous indictments charging extortion and payoffs from employers. The case acted on today is Local 17 vs. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 88-400.

<HEAD>Newspaper: DEA Supervised Fake Drug Seizures, Staged News Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Undercover federal drug agents have helped smuggle drugs and then staged police seizure of the contraband, and have helped drug manufacturers obtain needed chemicals before arresting them, newspapers report. The staged drug seizures, represented to news reporters as drugs taken from real smugglers, helped undercover agents gain the confidence of drug lords by convincing the bosses the loss of the drugs was legitimate, the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronical </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. `` The Colombians, the only way they'll believe you is to show them the stuff -LRB- drugs -RRB-, the money or the newspaper clips,'' <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> has given suspected drug dealers the required chemicals and even built a drug laboratory for one target. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> told the Post that <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents watched a suspected dealer in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> make and deliver methamphetamines and Quaaludes but did not intercept the drugs. The dealer, however, was arrested, he said. `` If the point of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> is to get drugs off the street, they violated policy,'' said <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, who specializes in drug cases. `` I'm saying our basic goal is to infiltrate drug dealers,'' said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Hambrick </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> chief in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` We ca n't expose what we do undercover.'' The practice of staging fake seizures and feeding the information to reporters apparently began several years ago to resolve a dilemma for undercover agents posing as cocaine importers for Colombian drug lords, the Chronicle reported. Often DEA operatives deliver drugs according to instructions from Colombian exporters, but keep the shipment under surveillance in hopes of intercepting it before it hits the streets, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> sometimes ensures that a shipment of drugs never reaches the street by `` dropping the load'' in cooperation with local authorities, who stage phony seizures and allow the undercover operation to proceed without detection, the newspaper said. In 1984, <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents helped smuggle 952 pounds of cocaine into the country, then abandoned their van at a prearranged <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> roadblock set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>. On Aug. 2, 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> alerted news reporters that troopers had discovered a record cache of drugs. On Sept. 29 of this year, 60 kilograms of cocaine were planted in an abandoned car and `` left to be discovered'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which notified reporters. <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Klevenhagen </PERSON> praised the bogus seizures as `` very productive in taking illicit drugs off the street.'' Because of its success, he said, the practice has gained national acceptance. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> is willing to lie to the media and public about this issue,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> Managing Editor <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Pederson </PERSON>, `` what else might they be willing to lie about?'' <PERSON> Pederson </PERSON> acknowledged that extraordinary measures are necessary to fight drug trafficking, but said government agencies must maintain credibility. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said the technique is used in high drug traffic areas including <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It's a procedure that is used, but I ca n't begin to tell you with what frequency. It's not a new technique, I can tell you that,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said.

 A Welsh extremist group claimed responsibility today for firebomb attacks that damaged five <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> real estate agencies. `` More attacks will follow unless the English leave <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>,'' a man claiming to represent the Sons of <PERSON> Glyndower </PERSON> warned in a telephone call to a national newspaper in <LOCATION> Cardiff </LOCATION>, the Welsh capital. Police said five crude devices which exploded Sunday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were pushed through letter boxes at real estate offices in <LOCATION> Mayfair </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Notting </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. One blast extensively damaged <PERSON> Strutt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s building in <LOCATION> Mayfair </LOCATION> where a firefighter injured his back falling through a floor, police said. The Sons of Glyndower, named after a Welsh hero, previously claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on real estate agents near the Welsh border to protest sales of rural Welsh property to English buyers. The organization says most English buyers are part-time residents who are not part of the community and only push up house prices, driving local people out of the market. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> police have formed a special detective squad to track the Sons of <LOCATION> Glyndower </LOCATION> but have made no arrests.

 A man apparently annoyed by a boy making faces and pointing a toy gun at him from a window got a rifle and killed the child, state police said. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Furguson </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Sloansville </LOCATION> was charged with second-degree murder in the death Sunday of 7-year-old <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Effner </PERSON>, said Trooper L.D. <PERSON> Teetz </PERSON>.

After the shooting, <PERSON> Furguson </PERSON> fled and was arrested in <LOCATION> Guilderland </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Furguson </PERSON> was arraigned Sunday and was held in lieu of $ 25,000 bail, state police said.

<HEAD>Court Won't Block Retrial in NY Drug, Racketeering Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to block the retrial of a federal drug and racketeering case against 10 men, including the brother of reputed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> crime boss <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that putting the defendants on trial again will not violate their double-jeopardy rights. Prosecutors charged the defendants took part in a multimillion-dollar heroin-smuggling operation. Three defendants, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruggiero </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON>, have been on trial twice. The first time, a mistrial was declared last January after nine months when the government charged jury tampering. All 10 defendants were on trial in that case. The second trial, involving only <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ruggiero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON>, ended in July when the jurors failed to reach a verdict. <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> is the brother of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, the reputed boss of the Gambino crime family. Authorities describe <PERSON> Ruggiero </PERSON> as a captain in the crime syndicate and <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON> as a member. The other defendants are <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> LoPresti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Moscatiello </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ansourian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurino </PERSON>. The appeal acted on today focused on the first mistrial, declared by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Constantino </PERSON> after he found evidence the defendants attempted to identify and influence the jury. <PERSON> Constantino </PERSON> dismissed three jurors from the panel on grounds of bias and then said that left an insufficient number to try the case. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last April that a retrial would not subject the 10 defendants to double jeopardy in violation of their rights. The appeals court noted that the disqualified jurors denied they had been approached but said they no longer could be impartial. The trial judge `` properly could have concluded that leaving these individuals on the jury was not a reasonable alternative,'' the appeals court said. The appeals court said the judge's finding that there was `` a distinct possibility'' of jury tampering is enough to warrant a mistrial. The appeals court also said it would be impractical to conduct a mini-trial to determine whether the allegedly tainted jurors actually were influenced improperly. The case is <PERSON> Ruggiero </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-374.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact North Dakota Law on Teaching Children at Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today left intact a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> law that requires parents who teach their children at home to be certified by the state. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by parents who said the law violates their right to practice their religion freely. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> law was challenged by <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> <PERSON> Dagley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mandan </LOCATION>. The couples said they believe that God has given them responsibility for their children, including their education, and that sending them to school away from home would violate their religious convictions. The Andersons were fined $ 1,000 and the Dagleys $ 500 for violating the state's compulsory school attendance law. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> requires school attendance for children 7 to 16. The law also requires that religious schools be approved by the state and that such schools employ teachers who are certified by the state. The law permits parents who are certified as teachers to conduct schools at home for their children. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the statute last June. It said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s `` compelling interest in the education of children'' permits some restriction on the free exercise of religion. The only question is `` whether or not the state has chosen the least restrictive alternative to achieve its compelling interest,'' the state court said. It said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> could choose another system, such as authorizing visits to homes by state officials and monitoring the children's educational process. But the state court said those alternatives might mean a more intrusive role for the state in supervising the religious training of children taught at home. The Andersons and <PERSON> Dagleys </PERSON> said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> is the only state in the nation that requires parents who teach their children at home to be state-certified. `` Scientific and educational evidence points unanimously to the same conclusion _ home-schooled children taught by uncertified parents are receiving an excellent education,'' they said. The parents said a less-restrictive alternative for the state would be to require parents to disclose at the outset that they are teaching their children at home and then require the children to take periodic tests given by public school officials. The case is <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 88-350.

<HEAD>Second Suspicious Fatal Fire In Two Days Kills Two Women At
Boardinghouse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Arson is suspected in two weekend fires that killed six people and sent nine others to hospitals, police said. Both fires began on the porches of the buildings, said Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Norling </PERSON>. The fire Sunday killed two women at a boardinghouse, and the fire Saturday at a duplex killed four people and critically injured a fifth person. Later Saturday, a third suspicious fire that also began on a porch damaged a home a few blocks from the duplex, authorities said. But Sgt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Skala </PERSON> of the police homicide division said it is not known whether the blazes were related. Police had no suspects. Fourteen people, several of whom were mentally ill, lived at the boardinghouse in the low-income neighborhood near downtown, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, its manager. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, who said he owns the boardinghouse, said he was told by investigators that the fire was caused by flammable liquid spilled on the front porch of the two-story wooden building and ignited. The body of one of the dead women was discovered a few feet from the front door. `` She almost made it,'' said resident <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgivens </PERSON>. `` If she would have gone to the back door, she would have made it, but she went to where the fire was.'' He escaped by breaking through a first-floor window. `` I could n't make it another two seconds,'' <PERSON> Fitzgivens </PERSON> said. `` The smoke was so black. I took one inhale of that smoke, and I knew I would die, so I did n't take another.'' The two dead women were identified by the <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner's office as <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, 47, and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sjorgren </PERSON>, 51, who lived in the building. Eight people were brought to the <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Medical Center from the boardinghouse. Two were in serious condition, one in satsfactory condition and the others were treated and released, the hospital said. Homicide Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> LaVine </PERSON> said the duplex fire deaths Saturday were being investigated as a multiple homicide. The medical examiner's office identified the victims as <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Kugel </PERSON>, 41; her sons, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Kugel </PERSON>, 10; and a family friend, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 21. All four died from smoke inhalation. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s twin brother, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, who also was visiting, remained in critical condition at <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Medical Center. Six people who were downstairs in the wooden duplex escaped unharmed after a fire alarm sounded, fire officials said.

<HEAD>Indian Remains Re-Buried After Three Years Of Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FALLON, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The remains of more than 130 ancient Indians have been reburied after three years of research provided scientists with new knowledge about pre-historic humans in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The remains showed a record of continuous human occupation of the Stillwater Marshes for at least 5,000 years, said anthropologists and archaeologists at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. They said the bones and artifacts also showed that the ancient <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> people were more numerous, less nomadic and healthier than many scientists originally thought. The graves of the people believed to be the ancestors of the modern-day Paiute Indians were exposed by floods during the record-wet winters of 1982-84 in the Stillwater Marshes near here. The bones were quietly reburied in a private Paiute ceremony earlier this month at an undisclosed site in the marshes 60 miles east of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. Anthropologists were able to identify more than 130 individuals, the most ever found at a prehistoric site in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, officials said. <PERSON> Anan </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>, archaeologist for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION>, said that gives the site national significance and makes it one of the most important archaeological finds in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sheilagh </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> anthropologist, said the 4,000 bones temporarily removed from the marshes could have represented as many as 416 people. But she said no more than 133 individuals were confirmed since there were too few bones and they were mixed up. Using carbon dating at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Riverside </ORGANIZATION>, scientists found some bones as old as 3,200 years and some buried as recently as three centuries ago, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said the type of artifacts found at the sites, mainly arrowheads, pushes those dates back `` a couple thousand more years.'' Anthropologists were unable to establish a direct genetic link between the remains and the modern Paiutes, but found `` a lot of similarity in the skulls and faces,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. She said remains of prehistoric Indians found at various locations in northern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION>, are quite similar to today's Indians, `` big-boned, what we call well-built, sturdy people, with big noses. They show very little change in time.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Paiute-Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribe </ORGANIZATION>, said he has no doubts the remains belong to his ancestors. The tribe still was burying some of its dead in the marshes as late as the 1930s, he said. `` Some of us in our 50s can remember that when we were little guys, they would take them back out that way, toward the desert.'' The marsh also yielded house foundations, hearths, roasting pits, food storage pits, garbage heaps and extensive stone tools. `` This is not a burial site, per se, but a bigger picture: a place where people lived, hunted and fished and buried their kinsmen,'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said.

 Tornadoes today ripped through a department store, destroyed mobile homes and churches and damaged apartment buildings, killing five people and injuring more than 143 others, authorities said. Three of the deaths, including an 11-year-old boy, were in <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, and the others were in neighboring <LOCATION> Nash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, officials said. Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said three storm systems hit the state and at least 15 tornado touchdowns were reported in seven counties. In north <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, tornadoes raked a path through a five-mile area. Four three-story apartment buildings and a department store were flattened. `` I can remember hearing a big gust of wind like a hurricane and then I could hear the wood tearing and I thought, ` Oh God, this is it, I'm gone.' I just buried myself under the bed,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, who was in bed when a tornado hit. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON>, 34, of the Calibre Oaks complex said he grabbed a pillow and got behind his bedroom door until the tornado passed. `` The roof was totally gone, the patio doors were gone and every window was smashed. The carpet was rolled up like someone was going to replace it,'' he said, adding he had to dig his way out from the corner of the room. Raleigh City Manager <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said 62 people were taken to hospitals in <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, including three who required surgery. At least nine houses were destroyed and 44 damaged, he said. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said city officials received no warning from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> about the possibility of tornadoes. `` We did not have a tornado watch nor warning before the storm struck,'' he said. He and Raleigh Mayor <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Upchurch </PERSON> flew over the affected area today and <PERSON> Upchurch </PERSON> said, `` It looked like a big bouncing ball had gone through there.'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedenson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it appeared that damages could be as serious as tornadoes that struck southeastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in 1984 and caused about $ 65 million in damage. City officials said 500 people were homeless. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, at a 6 a.m. briefing, said six people had died, but later, officials said one of those deaths was not storm-related. Officials at the state Division of <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> said 143 people were taken to hospitals. Uncounted others were treated for minor injuries. The tornadoes first struck Raleigh around 1:15 a.m., <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. City buses transported more than 300 people to two shelters, he said. Later in the morning, the storms moved into eastern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, pushing over trees and bringing heavy wind and rain, the weather service said. A tornado warning there expired at 6 a.m. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said a tornado touched down near <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, cutting power to much of the area. There were reports of damage to mobile homes, but no injuries were reported. Power outages were widespread in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, authorities said. `` We've had churches that have been demolished, some trailers and some homes,'' said <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who added that <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> personnel were on their way. In northern <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, a K mart store was flattened, and three people were trapped inside, said police Sgt. <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>. All three were rescued, but one man suffered a broken leg, said Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON>. Bricks, cinder blocks and twisted steel girders lay in a heap with racks of clothing and other merchandise. Police dispatched officers to nearby neighborhoods to look for people in need of help and to prevent looting. `` It appears that we've got extensive damage all over the area,'' <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> said. `` We do have some extensive injuries, but I ca n't tell you how many, or who, or where.'' In addition to the flattened apartment buildings, numerous others suffered structural damages, said <PERSON> Deirdre </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolling </PERSON>, manager of the <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s Pond complex. No one in those buildings was seriously hurt, and residents were given lodging at hotels, she said. The first rescue workers on the scene there pulled people from third-floor windows. Several residents wandered around dazed, with visible cuts. One man wore only a bath towel.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today left intact the current system for giving members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> pay raises. The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the process _ which produced a $ 12,000 congressional pay raise last year _ gives too much power to the president to determine salary levels. The justices also declined to use the case to examine what power members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have to challenge the constitutionality of federal laws. The system for approving congressional pay hikes, established by a 1967 law, was challenged by Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and five <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members after congressional pay was raised $ 12,000 last year to $ 89,500. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here upheld the pay-raise system last May 31. The system also controls salary increases for federal judges and high-ranking executive branch officials. But the challengers to the law did not attack those provisions. The appeals court said the system is constitutional because it allows <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to override salary increases granted by the president. From the founding of the nation until 1967, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation to set its salary scale. Seeking to share the responsibility for giving itself pay raises, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the Federal Salary Act in 1967. The law calls for convening every four years a salary study commission appointed by all three branches of government. The commission makes a recommendation to the president, who then submits his pay plan to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The president's recommendations become effective unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> disapproves them within 30 days of receiving them. The act was amended in 1985 to require action by both houses to override the president's recommendations. The original law permitted either house to veto a pay hike. But the so-called legislative veto was declared unconstitutional by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1983. The appeals court here said the elimination of the legislative veto causes `` marginally increased practical difficulty'' for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to override a presidential recommendation. But the fact remains, the appeals court said, `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is afforded the opportunity explicitly to reject or modify any or all of the president's recommendations before they go into effect.'' The appeals court also rejected the challenge to the pay-hike statute on independent grounds. It said federal courts have an obligation not to rule in disputes where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the power to remedy the problem itself. The court also rejected an argument that delegating a role to the president in setting congressional salaries violates the constitutional separation of powers among the three branches of government. Challenging the law along with <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> were Reps. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, R-Calif.; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, R-Ill.; and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, They were joined by consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to uphold the pay-raise system. In other action, the court: _ Refused to let a Jewish organization display a menorah, symbolizing the Hanukkah holiday, on the steps of a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> government building next month. The justices, by an 8-1 vote, turned down an emergency request aimed at allowing display of the 18-foot menorah. _ Agreed to referee an important railroad industry dispute affecting the ability of railroads to sell off their lines and reduce their work forces. The court said it will use appeals involving the small <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Erie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to resolve issues troubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide. _ For the second time this month refused to grant husbands legal power to prevent their wives from having an abortion. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> man who sought unsuccessfully last summer to stop his then-estranged wife from ending her pregnancy. The justices also turned down a companion appeal by a court-appointed guardian of the fetus. _ Allowed prosecutors investigating labor union corruption in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to use subpoenaed membership lists obtained from four carpenters union locals. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the rights of the union and its members were not violated by forcing the locals to turn over the lists. _ Left intact a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> law that requires parents who teach their children at home to be certified by the state. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by parents who said the law violates their right to practice their religion freely. The congressional pay-raise case is <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, 88-352.

Police Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tieman </PERSON> said authorities did not know a motive for the abduction.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is likely to be indicted by a federal grand jury investigating how the ministry's leaders raised and spent millions of dollars in contributions, his attorney said `` It's a question of when, and what the particular allegations will be,'' lawyer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said. The 23-member grand jury reconvened this morning in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said Friday that the indictment is likely to come the week of Dec. 12. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who resigned as <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> president in March 1987 after the revelation that he had a tryst with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and paid her hush money, has denied any criminal wrongdoing, and has called the investigation `` a fishing expedition.''

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> violated international law by denying him a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> committed `` a grave violation of the 1947 headquarters treaty with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'' by rejecting his visa application. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spoke to reporters after arriving from <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, where he met with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s military headquarters. `` Why are they afraid that I speak to world public opinion and explain the new Palestinian decisions?'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. He called rejection of the visa `` a sheer violation of the international law and the U.N. charter.'' He maintained the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was ignoring international backing for the newly proclaimed state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. More than 30 governments have declared support for the independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied territories declared Nov. 15 by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> rejected the visa application in response to an Israali request. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Saturday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had rejected <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s visa application.

 Killer tornadoes swept through <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> today, destroying churches and homes and killing five people, and a blizzard in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> halted thousands of holiday travelers, stranding many of them in small towns overnight. The tornadoes left at least 143 people injured, officials said. Raleigh City Manager <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said nine houses were destroyed and 44 damaged. Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said 15 tornado touchdowns were reported in seven counties. The last tornado strikes were near <LOCATION> Bayboro </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pamlico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and near <LOCATION> Manteo </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Dare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, both on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` It was like a train, like you hear people say. It was like a jet coming down too low,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>, who lives at a <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> apartment complex struck by a tornado. Later in the morning, the storms moved into eastern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, pushing over trees and bringing heavy wind and rain, and a tornado near <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> cut power to much of the area, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. In the southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, with a population of 4,000, at least 2,000 motorists stranded by snowstorms spent part of the night in a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armory </ORGANIZATION>, a school, four churches and many private homes, said Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Seim </PERSON>. At <LOCATION> Rothsay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, a 50th wedding anniversary celebration at <ORGANIZATION> Hamar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> was canceled because of the weather and the family donated the food to 250 stranded motorists, said Pastor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Magelssen </PERSON>. At least 500 people waited out the storm at the Jackson Best Western motel in the lobby, coffee shop, dining room and lounge, said manager <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. Snow blasted by wind gusting to 70 mph cut visibility to 100 feet at times Sunday in <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota-Morris </ORGANIZATION> was closed today. The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> State Patrol closed 80 miles of Interstate 90 from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> border to <LOCATION> Fairmont </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> during Sunday afternoon because of whiteout conditions and a 20-mile section of eastbound I-94 from <LOCATION> Fergus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rothsay </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> following multicar pileups. The patrol reopened I-94 Sunday evening but I-90 remained closed until early today. On the blocked section of I-94, it was `` one big accident with more than 100 cars involved,'' said patrol Lt. <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Geve </PERSON>. No injuries were reported. Most people resumed travel late Sunday night and early today after the wind dropped to 10 mph, said dispatcher <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Vollan </PERSON> at the state highway office in <LOCATION> Windom </LOCATION>. The 1,000 people sheltered at the armory in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> left in groups during the night as conditions improved, and the last two cars left before 8 a.m., said Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gay </PERSON>. Most of the 500 to 600 people stranded at the high school in <LOCATION> Sherburn </LOCATION> left late Sunday, head cook <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said today. The snowstorm that began Saturday in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> dumped up to 16 inches of snow at <LOCATION> Aitkin </LOCATION>. An accident Saturday that killed an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> man was blamed on ice and poor visibility. There were snowdrifts 5 feet high in <LOCATION> Rothsay </LOCATION>, residents said. Blizzard conditions and near-blizzard conditions were present in some southwestern and central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> communities, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. Temperatures dipped into the teens and winds gusted to 35 mph over much of the state, lowering wind-chill readings to minus 30 in some areas, he said. <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, of suburban <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, was traveling home with her daughter after visiting her parents for Thanksgiving in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, and ended up at the church in <LOCATION> Rothsay </LOCATION>. `` There was a semi in the ditch on my right, a semi in the ditch on my left and that was enough for me,'' <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said. `` I went to the gas station and they said the church was open so I thought that is where I'm going and that is where I'm staying until it's clear to go.'' Elsewhere, a snowstorm in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> that began Friday night dropped up to 50 inches at the <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Resort </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The storm caused numerous traffic accidents, including a collision that killed a 21-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> man. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, dense fog at <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>'s airport forced a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner with 137 people aboard to be diverted for refueling at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, about 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a small plane flying into stormy weather with apparent engine trouble broke apart as it crashed Sunday into a swamp in the <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>, killing all four aboard, officials and witnesses said. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a man was killed Saturday and another injured when their single-engine airplane plunged into a house in fog in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lavaca </LOCATION>, authorities said. Two people in the house were not injured. In the small northern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ruleville </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> declared a state of emergency Sunday, a day after a tornado destroyed four homes and damaged at least 38 others as well as three schools.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers today approved a new production accord that will sharply cut their output and raise crude oil prices. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s oil minister, <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, emerged from a session of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> and said the deal was formally completed. All 13 members of the cartel signed the accord, which sets a target price of $ 18 a barrel although crude has been selling at $ 14 a barrel and less. Analysts have said the agreement, which goes into effect Jan. 1 and runs for six months, could send crude prices climbing by $ 1 or $ 2 a barrel. Each $ 1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means an increase of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices, although oil companies do not always pass along the full increase. The agreement sets the cartel's total production at 18.5 million barrels a day in the first six months of the year. It currently is running at 22.5 million barrels a day. The ministers' aim is to curtail their production in an effort to reduce the glut on the market and lift sagging prices. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said the accord would have a `` positive, very positive'' effect on the oil market and predicted prices could reach $ 18 a barrel `` maybe by June.'' If all 13 countries curb their production as provided under the accord, prices will get a strong lift, he said. `` It's a hell of a lot of oil to take out of the market,'' he said. `` It should shock the price sharply up very quickly.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had tried to set a minimum price of $ 15 in the accord, but that effort met resistance. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said late Sunday the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> proposal was designed to prevent prices from falling below $ 15. But other ministers said the minimum price could become the ceiling price. <PERSON> Barkeshli </PERSON> said Sunday the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> proposal was `` a major divergence from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> resolutions so far'' and could `` totally sabotage the agreement.'' `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is not going to accept this type of idea,'' he said. Under the accord, each country would be given a production quota, or ceiling, within the total limit of 18.5 million barrels a day. Many <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries need more money from their oil sales. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> want additional revenues to rebuild their economies, which were badly damaged in their eight-year war. They agreed to an August cease-fire. Under the new agreement, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> each will get the same quota of 2.64 million barrels a day. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had been demanding an equal production ceiling with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which repeatedly said no. Under the new accord, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will retain its production share at 14.27 percent of the cartel's total output. Other countries would give up some of their share to bring <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> up to the same level as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> maintains the largest share at about a quarter of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s total output. Under the current accord, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has a cap of 2.4 million barrels a day. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was given a ceiling of 1.5 million barrels but ignored it. Analysts estimate its production at 2.7 million barrels a day. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.

A spokesman for <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> security police who asked not to be identified said the Austrian-born woman died of lung and brain edema.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. CONGRESSIONAL PAY RAISES The court left intact the current system for giving members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> pay raises. The justices, without comment, rejected arguments that the process _ which produced a $ 12,000 congressional pay raise last year _ gives too much power to the president to determine salary levels. The justices also declined to use the case to examine what power members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have to challenge the constitutionality of federal laws. The case is <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, 88-352. MENORAH The court refused to let a Jewish organization display a menorah, symbolizing the Hanukkah holiday, on the steps of a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> government building next month. The justices, by an 8-1 vote, turned down an emergency request aimed at allowing display of the 18-foot menorah. The case is Chabad vs. <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, A-384. RAILROADS The court agreed to referee an important railroad industry dispute affecting the ability of railroads to sell off their lines and reduce their work forces. The court said it will use appeals involving the small <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Erie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to resolve issues troubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Erie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1589, <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> LE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> vs. RLE, 87-1888, and RLE vs. C & amp; NW, 88-464. ABORTION The court, for the second time this month, refused to grant husbands legal power to prevent their wives from having an abortion. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> man who sought unsuccessfully last summer to stop his then-estranged wife from ending her pregnancy. The justices also turned down a companion appeal by a court-appointed guardian of the fetus. The cases are <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 88-555, and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 88-683. CARPENTERS The court allowed prosecutors investigating labor union corruption in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to use subpoenaed membership lists obtained from four carpenters union locals. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the rights of the union and its members were not violated by forcing the locals to turn over the lists. The case acted on today is Local 17 vs. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 88-400. HOME SCHOOLS The court left intact a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> law that requires parents who teach their children at home to be certified by the state. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by parents who said the law violates their right to practice their religion freely. The case is <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 88-350.

<HEAD>Freed Black Leader Dares Botha to Remove Bans on Opposition Groups</HEAD>

 A black nationalist leader freed after 12 years in prison Monday challenged the government to legalize outlawed black opposition groups. <PERSON> Zeph </PERSON> <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON> also urged blacks to unite, and he called for freedom of all jailed activists, including his rival <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. `` Long Live The Pan-Africanist Congress!'' supporters chanted as the ailing 75-year-old president of the banned organization arrived for a news conference. It was his first public appearance since 1976. The government said it freed him unconditionally Saturday for humanitarian reasons. For years, followers of <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON>'s group have been at ideological odds with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s African National Congress. Both organizations train guerrillas to fight white-minority domination. But the Pan-Africanists favor black self-reliance, while the larger <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> supports a multiracial approach. <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON>, who quit the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> in 1959, adopted a conciliatory tone Monday. `` My first task, which I am going to do everything in my powers to discharge, is to unite the African people,'' he said. `` We do n't look at the color of a person _ we consider his convictions. In calling for the release of jailed activists, <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON> named <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and fellow Pan-Africanist leader <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Masemola </PERSON> `` as symbols of all other prisoners of conscience who should be out here and working for the return of our land.'' `` They should be released not on the grounds of compassion or mercy but because they are held illegitimately,'' he said. <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON> has been seriously ill for months with cancer of the thymus gland, but he said he would remain active politically. `` I issue a direct challenge to -LRB- President P.W. -RRB- <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Let him unban the PAC and all other political organizations.'' <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON> urged foreign countries to intensify economic, cultural and sporting boycotts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> until the government made major political concessions. Currently, the black majority has no vote in national affairs. He declined to assess political changes during his imprisonment, when the government claimed significant reforms. But <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON> warned: `` I am calling on the international community not to be fooled by cosmetic change. `` The only item we are prepared to negotiate is the return of the land and the wealth to its rightful owners,'' he said. A former teacher, <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON> cautioned black students to think carefully about classroom boycotts as a political tactic. `` Use the schools wisely as an arena for the struggle,'' he said, wishing them good luck in examinations. The simultaneous, unconditional releases of <LOCATION> Mothopeng </LOCATION> and longtime <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON>, 69, were the latest in a series of government moves aimed partly at improving its international standing. In the span of a week, the government: _ Announced <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> would not return to prison when he completes his recovery from tuberculosis but will remain in custody at an unspecified location. _ Reprieved with lengthy jail terms the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six blacks sentenced to hang for complicity in a 1984 mob killing. _ Endorsed a regional peace plan to grant independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>.

 New CBS programming executive <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Corday </PERSON> hopes to bring the network out of the ratings cellar by appealing to a younger audience. `` A lot of producers think of CBS as a lot older and a lot more rural than it actually is,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Corday </PERSON>, the new vice-president in charge of prime-time entertainment. `` But CBS has begun to turn around a little bit in the areas of slightly younger, slightly more upscale, more female-oriented shows.'' Among the new projects is a series based on the hit <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> movie `` Big.''

 The nation's biggest banks raised their prime lending rates a half percentage point to 10.5 percent today, the fourth increase this year. The increase, effective immediately, pushes the base lending rate to its highest level since May 1985, when it was lowered a half percentage point to 10 percent. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Manhattan </PERSON> was the first institution to announce the hike, with several other major banks joining the move, including <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Reaction in the financial markets was restrained. At noon on Wall Street, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average was down 5.33 points to 2,069.35, while bond prices were mixed. The dollar initially rose in foreign exchange trading, but quickly retreated. Analysts had been expecting a prime hike due to the steady increase of interest rates in the credit markets in recent weeks. `` It comes as no surpise given the rise in short-term rates,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, economist for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said there also was `` building perception in the marketplace'' that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might push rates even further by raising its discount rate, or the interest charged to member banks for loans, to support the dollar Concerns about the growing federal budget and trade deficits have pushed the dollar sharply lower against most major currencies in recent weeks. The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates. But the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including popular home-equity loans. `` It's clear that consumers will be absorbing higher borrowing costs in December or early next year,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced today that <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> would remain in his post in the new administration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he selected <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> because `` I think he's the best.'' His appointment marked the latest in a series of high-level holdovers from the old administration to the new. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised fresh faces for his turn in the Oval Office, telling reporters, `` Stay tuned for the changes.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, a stocky, balding 46-year-old career government spokesman _ who worked for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before becoming President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman _ said the incoming president would hold news conferences `` as much as possible They should be as regular as possible.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after his announcement, went to a private lunch with former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., whose help he will need in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` The election is over. I vowed to the president-elect we'd work together,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said as the two began their meeting in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s suite in the Old Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. `` There's a lot of work to do. That's the way it works.'' For his part, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that with the campaign now past, `` the focus is properly on the future.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the selection of his press spokesman in an appearance in the White House briefing room from the podium where <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> stands daily to answer questions about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy, personnel and controversies. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had asked <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> `` to remain as press secretary,'' the title the president's chief spokesman usually has. Although <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> has been <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s main spokesman, he has had the title of assistant to the president for press relations. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was seriously wounded in the assassination attempt on the president in March 1981, has kept the title of press secretary. When asked whether <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> would have a role in the new administration, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I know the vice president is very interested in <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and concerned about his well being and has raised the question internally.'' `` I think they have some ideas of things they would like him to do, but have n't fleshed them out,'' he said. `` I would recommend we sit down with <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s wife -RRB- and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and see what their plans are,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The president-elect said he had no other announcements to make during the day, despite speculation that he soon would appoint former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as defense secretary and name longtime associate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He said of Fitzwater: `` He represents the old and the new ... the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and also the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration.'' The president-elect added, `` We'll have a lot of changes as I said. This is continuity in the best sense.'' Other high-level holdovers from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration include <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>. Also, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who served as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff and then treasury secretary, will be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s secretary of state. At the beginning of his meeting with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated he was n't expecting an easy time on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Mentioning the budget deficit specifically, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` As we start, there are going to be some problems. There are plenty of problems out there.'' He said he intended to work with both Republicans and Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in forging solutions to those problems. `` That's exactly the spirit that this end of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> is going to have,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, his choice for budget director, would be joining them at the lunch meeting to discuss budget issues. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> is a longtime government spokesman whose resume includes stints at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential office. He left <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff in February 1987 to become <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s White House spokesman. He said was contacted by the vice president at 8:30 a.m. today. `` He made the offer and I quickly accepted,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary during the transition period, will remain in that job until Jan. 20, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. When reporters bombarded him with questions, he joked: `` A two minute honeymoon. Amazing.'' He promised frequent contact with reporters. `` I love to brief. I brief every day. The vice president has been holding press conferences at the rate of one every five hours.'' The announcement came after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned from his Thanksgiving Holiday vacation at his family estate in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and marked the beginning of a busy period for the president-elect. In addition to his meeting with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> later in the day, he arranged a session with all <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans for Tuesday in the Capitol. He also is expected to continue working on assembling his new team, and is traveling to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> next week to participate in meetings between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after being overwhelmed by the vice president in last winter's <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primaries, the two have had little contact since then. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said the meeting was arranged by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but that both men had wanted it for some time. `` It's of mutual interest,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has met with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and has promised a meeting with the new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader as soon as he is chosen. The president-elect will join <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for a Dec. 7 luncheon with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> during the Soviet leader's visit to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. In his campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged wariness in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealings with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, saying that just because current <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leaders seem more reform-minded is no reason for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to let down its guard.

 A former fund-raiser for <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> testified today that he was instructed to tell people lending money to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> organizations that they could n't be repaid right away because <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was fighting for the human race and `` in war there are casualties.'' <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s conspiracy trial that the instruction came from <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> fund-raising chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>, one of six <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> associates on trial with the political maverick in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here. The defendants are accused of devising a scheme to avoid repayment of loans made to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> organizations. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> alone is accused of defrauding the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> by failing to declare personal services, paid for by his organizations, as income. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said he spoke to <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON> about the failure to repay loans after a retired school teacher complained to him that she lived off her savings and needed her money back. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON> told him he did n't want to hear complaints about loan repayments. `` We're in the midst of a war fighting for the human race. We're at war In war there are casualties. You have to tell your contacts that.'' `` Did you tell them this?'' asked Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>. `` No sir,'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> replied. `` We did n't tell them there would be casualties.'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> was the third former employee of the three-time presidential candidate to paint an unflattering picture of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, who sought contributions in telephone solicitations, told jurors that he and other <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> staffers were instructed to find ways to get the money _ and to accept no stories of financial hardship. `` The minute you listen to their excuses, you're dead,'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said he was told by superiors in the LaRouche organization. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and his co-defendants are charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and mail fraud, in an alleged scheme to avoid paying back more than $ 30 million in loans to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> organizations. The mail fraud counts result from promissory notes sent to lenders through the mail. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> alone is charged with conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, by failing to declare as income the personal and household services he received from his organizations. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> has not filed an income tax return since 1979, according to the indictment. The defendants contend that they had planned to pay back the loans, but had to use the money to defend themselves against harassment from the federal government and the news media. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> also says he's innocent of the tax count because he has not earned any taxable income since 1979. During the first three days of testimony last week, prosecutors called witnesses who said they were defrauded by <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> staffers who did not keep promises to repay their loans. Then the prosecution called former LaRouche employees, including a former security aide who described his onetime boss as paranoid and as a man who lied to his staff. However one prosecution witness, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, still works for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. He testified there was an attempt to pay back those who lent money to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s political campaigns, but funds were scarce. Prosecutors introduced into evidence an internal memo by <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, which made derogatory remarks about the contributors. Conviction for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> could bring a maximum prison term of 65 years and fines of $ 3.25 million. His six co-defendants would face lesser sentences if convicted. On trial with <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> are his fund-raising chief, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>; legal adviser <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Spannaus </PERSON>; and fund-raisers <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Challenge To Congressional Pay-Hike System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday refused to disturb the current system for giving pay raises to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ a system that produced a $ 12,000 salary hike last year. The justices rejected arguments that the process gives too much power to the president to determine salary levels. The court, also without comment, declined to use the case to determine what power members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have to challenge the constitutionality of federal laws. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and five <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members challenged the pay-raise system after congressional salaries were raised $ 12,000 last year to $ 89,500. The pay-raise system, which was established by a 1967 law, also controls salary increases for federal judges and high-ranking executive branch officials. But the challengers to the law did not attack those provisions. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> upheld the pay-raise system last May 31, ruling it is constitutional because it allows <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to override salary increases granted by the president. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> left that ruling intact Monday. In other action, the court: _ Heard arguments about the rights of unwed fathers whose children are put up for adoption by their mothers _ Refused for now to let a Jewish organization display a menorah, symbolizing the Hanukkah holiday, on the steps of a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> government building next month The court is reviewing the constitutionality of the display. _ Agreed to use a case involving a small <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> railroad to resolve an important railroad industry dispute affecting the ability of railroads to sell off their lines and reduce their work forces _ For the second time this month refused to grant husbands legal power to prevent their wives from having an abortion The court rejected an appeal by a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> man who sought unsuccessfully last summer to stop his then-estranged wife from ending her pregnancy. _ Allowed prosecutors investigating labor union corruption in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to use subpoenaed membership lists obtained from four carpenters union locals Prior to 1967, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had set its own salary scale. But the lawmakers, seeking to share responsibility for giving themselves pay raises, passed the Federal Salary Act in 1967. The act calls for a study commission to be convened every four years with members appointed by all three branches of government. The commission sumbits recommendations to the president, who in turn proposes a pay plan to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The president's recommendations become effective unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acts within 30 days to disapprove them. The law was amended in 1985 to require action by both houses to override the president's recommendations. The original law permitted either house to veto a pay hike. But the so-called legislative veto was declared unconstitutional by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1983. In its ruling in May, the appeals court said the elimination of the legislative veto causes `` marginally increased practical difficulty'' for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to override a presidential recommendation. But, the appeals court said, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> still is `` afforded the opportunity explicitly to reject or modify any or all of the president's recommendations before they go into effect.'' The appeals court also rejected the challenge to the pay-hike statute on grounds the federal courts should not rule in disputes in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the power to remedy the problem itself. The appeals court also rejected an argument that delegating a role to the president in setting congressional salaries violates the constitutional separation of powers among the three branches of government. Challenging the law along with <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> were Reps. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, R-Calif.; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, R-Ill.; and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, They were joined by consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to uphold the pay-raise system.

<HEAD>US Willing To Shift UN Debate On Palestinians To Geneva</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, while reaffirming its judgment that <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is an `` accessory'' to acts of terrorism, today said it would not oppose the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> shifting its debate on the Palestinian issue to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Even so, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, the shift was unnecessary since there were other spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who could speak on the subject apart from chairman <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` We do not oppose the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> considering the Palestinian question,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` It's an important matter.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that if the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session is moved to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, `` we would participate.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was denied a visa on Saturday by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> because, the secretary said, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` knows of, condones and lends support'' to acts of terrorism. On Sunday, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he agreed `` very much'' with the decision. Despite criticism from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and a number of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said today the decision was `` firm and final.'' He said denial of the visa was based on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s record. The Palestinian issue and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace are separate issues, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` Probably no other country in the world has worked as hard at the peace process as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s daily news briefing. He rejected the argument of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and other critics that the decision was in conflict with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arrangements with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reserved the right to protect its national security even while making arrangements in 1947 to have the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intended no affront to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were making no kind of statement about the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> but about <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and terrorism,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> took questions on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> shortly after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that he thought the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had violated international law by refusing to grant him permission to visit the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and to address that body early next month. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dcision has been assailed by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> groups. But all three Democrats seeking the top party leadership post in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offered their support. A spokesman for President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not been consulted in advance of the weekend <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today that `` I do n't think many Americans are having much trouble understanding this decision.'' Boarding Air Force One as he headed back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after a six-day vacation at his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> mountaintop ranch, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stressed that the decision on whether to admit <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was `` in the province of the secretary of state'' under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. In rejecting <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s request Saturday, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he could not waive a legal provision that rules ineligible for a visa any person considered by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be a threat to its security. `` No participant in a peace process can wave the flag of justice in one hand and brandish the weapons of terrorism in the other,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a weekend statement. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last addressed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1974. Asked Sunday whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was sending sufficient constructive messages about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process, given the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s recent moderate statements, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` I think the other would have sent a wrong signal _ that we're patsies.'' `` We are available and we have been ready to negotiate, when the conditions are right, at any and all times,'' he said. `` We're the ones with the peace plan.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not cite any specific acts of terrorism attributed to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in recent weeks or months, although he did say that `` I think the record shows the things the law is supposed to be protecting against are still going on in spite of the recent statements'' by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> along more moderate lines. Asked what he meant by that, the president said, `` Well, the approval and use of terrorism and that sort of thing.'' Meeting in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> recently, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the parliamentary arm of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization, endorsed resolutions implicitly recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renouncing terrorism. The administration said it found the statements promising, but too vague. When asked point-blank whether he believed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> still was behind terrorism, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` I think there is enough to justify not granting a waiver.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had `` convincing evidence'' that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> continues to engage in terrorism, and cited the presence at the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> meeting of an executive committee member convicted in connection with the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner and the murder of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON> in 1985. Sens. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> _ all guests on Sunday's `` Meet The Press'' program on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> _ said they agreed that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> should be denied permission to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should indicate to one and all that we stand against terrorism, and I think this was a very dramatic way of doing it,'' said <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, who will be vying with <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> for the post of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader in an election later this week. Said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>: `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has members ... who are engaged actively in terrorism, and as long as that organization does, I do n't think they should be allowed to speak at the U.N.''

<TEXT>
 Extra rain and snow are expected in drought-plagued areas of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> and the Northwest this winter, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said today. The winter forecast, covering December through February, said the extra precipitation could help those areas in recovering from the drought of last spring and summer. Continued dryness is likely, however, along the southern edge of the country, the agency reported. The forecast calls for a mild winter in the Southeast and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, while saying that parts of the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> can expect unusually cold conditions. Below-normal temperatures are considered likely in upper <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and neighboring parts of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>. Areas where warmer-than-normal winter weather is likely range from the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> southward to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and west through <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The best chance for a wet winter was in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the upper <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> as well as in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and the northern <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. A wet winter also was likely from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and the Appalachian mountain regions of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> will move swiftly to provide a forum for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who has been denied a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa to address the body, the assembly's president said today. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in his first public comments since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> denial Saturday, called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move `` a sheer violation of the international law and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> charter'' and claimed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was ignoring international backing for the newly proclaimed state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. `` Why are they afraid that I speak to world public opinion and explain the new Palestinian decisions?'' asked <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. He spoke to reporters in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said today in a written statement that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is under the obligation to grant the visa'' sought by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` As soon as we receive a special request from the Arab group we shall proceed in the best possible manner to ensure that Chairman <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is able to address the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The 159-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> was expected today or Tuesday to overwhelmingly support a request from the Arab nations to convene a special assembly in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to hear <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. The Arab nations were to meet today to formulate their request. The special session, which would be unprecedented for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, would be held either later this month or in January. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Relations with the <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> was to meet to consider the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision, which <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials call a violation of the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement. Under the agreement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agrees not to impede with the transit or work of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats or guests on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> business. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denied a visa to the <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Saturday, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman `` knows of, condones and lends support to'' terrorist attacks. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lauded the decision, saying: `` I think the other way would have sent out the wrong signal _ that we are patsies.'' Reaction from other nations was largely negative. Speaking today on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> `` This Morning,'' a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges of terrorism `` nonsense.'' `` It is not serious ... because he -LRB- Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> -RRB- can not substantiate his allegations,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> statement said that denying <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a forum `` would be unfortunate at a time when, in the view of the secretary-general, the recent meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> provides fresh opportunities for progress towards peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> parliament-in-exile, proclaimed an independent Palestinian state during its meeting in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> on Nov. 15. More than 30 countries, most of them Arab, have formally recognized the state. The Palestine homeland proclamation implicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by endorsing a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution that guarantees all <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> states the right to exist in peace. It promised to restrict guerrilla activity. The Arab League's <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, said Sunday he has enough votes to reconvene the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in special session in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> so <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> can address the group. The non-aligned group in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> has 101 of the 159 voting members in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has non-voting observer status. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and developing nations considered moving the current session to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempt to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer mission was working its way through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts In March, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> voted 148-2 to condemn the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempt to evict the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Mission by attempting to enforce an anti-terrorism law. Only <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> joined the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in voting against the resolution. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> have agreed to spearhead the effort to reconvene the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elsewhere, the official <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. Soviet bloc nations also are likely to side with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Israeli leaders praised the decision, but <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> were among other nations that protested it. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> summoned a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official to explain the decision. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency today called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move `` another unwise decision.'' <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> said it regretted the move.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON> says some men are shocked when they learn he is the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, but women tend to take it in stride because they `` do n't keep score the way men do. `` Most men that I know either do n't know how to handle it or, I would say, some are envious and confused ... Some will just say: ` Oh, he's president, congratulations,' based strictly on the fact that it's an office. They still do n't know what the heck it is.'' <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON>, 56, was elected president in October. He is the second man to serve as president of a state chapter of NOW, joining lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, who heads what is called the 51st state chapter in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newlin </LOCATION>, an administrative assistant for a large <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> firm, joined NOW in 1985. `` NOW has everything,'' he said in a recent interview. `` It's peace and economic justice It's civil rights for everybody _ women, children, gays, lesbians ... All of the things I really just automatically believed in because that's the way I grew up. It's not like I'm a big hero or something. It's just the way I am.'' <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON>, who is married and has two grown children, grew up during the Depression. `` We were n't rich by any means,'' he said, but when people came to his home, his mother would feed them. `` It was n't just at Christmas. I remember mother taking our clothes and giving them to poor people ... I mean, it was n't a big deal. You just did it. There was never any hero about it. ... It was just the people next door did n't have as much as you had and so you helped them out.'' <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON> got his start in the women's movement in the early 80s when, fearing `` the world -LRB- was -RRB- just going to whiz right by me,'' he decided to join an organization. He jumped at the opportunity to work with a <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> women's concerns group simply because it was the first organization he encountered. <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON> considers himself a feminist, but said he wo n't speak for women. `` I will speak on behalf of women the same as I would any other group who is struggling,'' he said. He said he was concerned that winning the presidency would make it appear he was trying to bully his way into a leadership position. `` I'm not a flash in the pan and I'm not ... in here for self gain.'' <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON>'s NOW colleagues agree. `` He goes out of his way not to even participate in a lot of discussions at our board meetings and things,'' said <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarbeau </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> chapter, the largest in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> with over 330 members. `` He's tried very hard to not let anyone think he's trying to come in and take over.'' <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, NOW's executive vice president, said <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON>'s presidency `` is perhaps a reflection of the maturing of the organization and of our movement that some women and the men who are members can look at this man and say he has a valuable skill and he's a strong feminist ... and we want to learn from him and want him to be our leader and we are not threatened by that.

<HEAD>12 Injured in Protests to Demand Ouster of President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HASAN SAEED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Protesters rioted Monday during a strike to demand the ouster of President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, and 12 people were injured in clashes with security forces, police and witnesses said. Police said 94 people were arrested and charged with rioting during the six-hour strike, which ended at noon. Most stores failed to open, and cars stayed off the streets. In other parts of the country, ferry, train and air traffic was disrupted. Helmeted police officers fired tear gas at bomb-throwing demonstrators outside <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Among those injured were two police officers, one of whom was hit by fragments from homemade bombs, police said. Witnesses said security forces with batons charged a procession by members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. They said the mainly young protestors also damaged eight vehicles and burned a bus. The strike halted most public transportation in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. A few state-run buses and some privately owned bicycle-powered rickshaws plied the streets. The city of 6 million people was generally calm later Monday except around <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where police confronted roving bands of youths who threw stones, bricks and small bombs. Paramilitary troops patrolled the streets in trucks. A senior official at the <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> Secretariat, the government's administrative center, said employee turnout at government offices and banks was thin in the early morning but increased later The strike was sponsored by two opposition groups _ <PERSON> Jamiaat-e-Islamic </PERSON>, a Moslem fundamentalist party, and a seven-party alliance led by <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The protests were part of the opposition's effort to force <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> to resign in favor of a caretaker government that would oversee free elections. The third main opposition group, an eight-party alliance headed by <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, did not join the strike but planned nationwide rallies as part of a `` resistance day against the autocratic regime.'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> put aside their personal differences a year ago to cooperate in an campaign against <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, but a series of often violent strikes failed to remove the former army general. The women blamed each other for the failure and have pursued separate protests. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, 59, seized power in a March 1982 coup and imposed military law, which was lifted in November 1986 in favor of a civilian government. His <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won a parliamentary majority in disputed March 3 elections that were boycotted by the 20 major opposition parties _ including those led by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> _ that have no vote in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Parliament has passed a law making Islam the official religion of this 85 percent Moslem nation, drawing strong protests from opposition politicians, women, students and representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, Hindu and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> minorities.

<HEAD>Dealer Trial Challenges Casino Right To Fire at Will</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The right of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> casinos to hire and fire casino workers at will _ something enjoyed since the industry was legalized more than 50 years ago _ is on trial in a suit brought by 37 dealers and floormen axed by the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION>. The casino workers, swept out five years ago in a housecleaning sparked by a sharp drop in the casino's blackjack win percentage, contend they were replaced by younger, mostly female, workers and are the victims of age and sex discrimination. The Hilton claims the firings are just part of life in the casino business, a cash-fed industry where a bad day's win may get a dealer fired and where greed and suspicion often dictate personnel decisions. Historically, the resort contends, casino workers have accepted the implied tradeoff between job security in exchange for the cash tips they take home every day. `` In return for the high compensation, there is little job security,'' argued <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. `` Changes of personnel are frequent in this industry.'' Casino workers such as dealers and floormen are non-union. Other hotel workers, such as kitchen help, waiters and others in the service industry, are generally members of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Culinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The fired workers _ who the <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> says averaged $ 100 a day in tips in addition to $ 45 a day salary _ are asking a federal court for reinstatement, back pay and damages that could run into the millions of dollars. The case is being watched as a possible precedent in a state where the idea of wrongful termination is an evolving area of law with only a few recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions to go by. `` We will show that they were fired based only on the date of hire,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, an attorney for the plaintiffs. `` They did n't even try to make any individual determination at all.'' `` Out of the 37 fired workers, all but five were over the age of 40,'' said <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>. `` They were replaced by 24 females and only one of the replacements was over the age of 40. If they had been firing just at random, there was a one-in-four-million chance they would fire that many old people.'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, however, said the average age of the fired workers was 40, while the replacements averaged 37.4 years of age. The dealers and floormen working the day and swing shift blackjack pit were fired without notice when they arrived at work Sept. 2, 1983. `` Almost all of them had good evaluations and some of them were legends in the industry,'' said <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>. `` They were the best of them all.'' The firings, both sides acknowledge, came after a period in which the casino's `` drop,'' or percentage of money it wins, fell to 1 percent at the blackjack tables. The Las Vegas average house percentage win in blackjack games is generally between 18 and 20 percent. `` Something drastic was occuring here,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` We're talking about thousands of dollars a day and millions of dollars over the long term. The resort finally decided to clean house. `` Following the termination of the plaintiffs in this case, the ` P.C.' -LRB- casino term for percentage -RRB- returned to normal,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said in opening arguments. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> acknowledged that the hotel never pinpointed any dealer cheating. The dealers contend middle management was stealing money, although they also can not prove their charges. `` Losses of the magnitude they were having could not be explained by a dealer scam,'' said <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>. `` We're talking about wheelbarrows full of chips they would have had to be hauling out of there.'' The trial, which began last week, is expected to continue for at least three months before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>.

 A government spokesman said Monday the next round of talks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> will take place in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> in mid-December. Negotiators are trying to forge an agreement that would extend <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> control of four bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> beyond the Dec. 31 expiration date. `` The base negotiations are very difficult and no one can exclude the possibility that they might be suspended at some stage,'' said government spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON>. The last round of negotiations ended earlier this month in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Talks broke off in September when <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> announced the <LOCATION> Hellenikon </LOCATION> base near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> would have to close after the current pact expires Dec. 31. About 1,400 American servicemen, 200 civilian employees and 700 Greeks work at the base, which was set up in the 1940s. Negotiations resumed Oct. 3, after Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carolos </PERSON> <PERSON> Papoulias </PERSON>, who was on a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Since the 1950s, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has operated four military bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, two near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and two on the southern island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>. In addition to <LOCATION> Hellenikon </LOCATION>, there is a <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> communications </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Nea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Makri </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, a navy installation at <LOCATION> Souda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on the island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>, and an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> communications base at <LOCATION> Gournes </LOCATION>, also on <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has asked police to find out how a turn-of-the-century chandelier that disappeared from the school sometime in the late 1970s has reappeared in the newly renovated <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>. The 175-pound chandelier, whose value is estimated at $ 15,000 to $ 20,000, is the centerpiece of the library's periodicals atrium, which was opened to the public with much fanfare two weeks ago. After the ceremony, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> officials realized the chandelier was identical to one that had hung in Alumnae Hall from 1927 until it was taken down during restoration work about 10 years ago, said university spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichley </PERSON>. `` Someone took a photo from our archives and compared it,'' <PERSON> Reichley </PERSON> said. `` There does n't seem to be any doubt whether it's one and the same.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Enright </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> dealer in light fixtures, told The <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in a story published Monday that he bought the fixture in 1985 from a Brown maintenance man who said he would take the chandelier to the junkyard if <PERSON> Enright </PERSON> did not want it. <PERSON> Enright </PERSON> later sold the chandelier to <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Groger </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> antiques dealer, who rented it to Trinity Repertory Theater in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> for a production of `` All the King's Men.'' The library purchased the chandelier from Groger last year after a staffer saw it at the theater, the newspaper said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuprevich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s director of police and security, said his department has asked city police to help investigate. `` It is our belief that it was not authorized to be disposed of in any way, shape or form,'' he said. <PERSON> Reichley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, chairman of the library's board of directors, said it was too early to tell whether <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> would attempt to recover the chandelier. `` We're working cooperatively and amicably in trying to solve this issue,'' <PERSON> Reichley </PERSON> said. `` I think it looks splendid. We certainly think it's an ideal fixture for our location,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Presidential Elections Set for Dec. 12, No Immediate Candidates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Presidential elections will take place in two weeks, officials announced Monday, but there were no immediate contenders for the mostly ceremonial post. The job is open to any Moslem aged 45 years or more. None of the parties that contested this month's general elections has put forward a candidate. The current president is <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, 73, formerly chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION> who took over Aug. 17 after Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> died in a plane crash. The president will be chosen by an electoral college of members of the <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION>, national assembly, and four provincial legislatures of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sind </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baluchistan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Frontier </LOCATION> province. Each will meet separately and simultaneously to elect the president Dec. 12. No party or group has enough of the 807 electoral votes to choose a president, should more than one candidate emerge. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, a senior civil servant and internationally known economist and diplomat, has indicated he may not seek election. `` I am tired and will like to have rest instead of being president,'' he said recently. But analysts say he could be persuaded to continue in the post if several political parties ask him. <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, whose popular <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won a majority of 93 national assembly and 184 provincial legislative seats, said her party wants a president supported by others. `` We want a consensus candidate, a person who knows all the policies and how the administration works,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s biggest rival is a nine-party grouping called the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> which won 55 national and 145 provincial seats. Both parties are trying to win over independents who garnered a large number of seats in national and provincial assemblies. The party commanding the biggest majority probably will be asked to form a government by <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> in an announcement scheduled Dec. 1. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> is expected to ask Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> to be prime minister, the holder of real political power in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, though the president can fire the prime minister. Presidential candidates must be nominated before Dec. 6.

<HEAD>State Department Says Blind Need Not Apply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON> had high hopes that his impressive academic and linguistic credentials would qualify him for a career in diplomacy. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, after showing interest in <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON> for three years, finally ruled against him. Diplomacy, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> believes, is not a suitable profession for the blind. `` I am absolutely outraged,'' <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` It is absolutely unconscionable that the rest of the government has shown itself to be able to employ blind people constructively. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is still in the 19th century.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had been accepting job applications from blind people for 10 years and <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON> himself had passed five entrance examinations since 1985. He recently was scheduled to take another. But the department ruled that the blind would not be permitted to take examinations in <LOCATION> Braille </LOCATION> or use other outside help, thus making it impossible for <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON> or others with similar disabilities to meet the entrance requirements. <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> with degrees in Spanish and French and has a master's degree in business administration from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. He was born in what is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> 46 years ago and lived for 15 years in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and six months each in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. He speaks with the elegantly phrased formulations of a man accustomed to intellectual pursuits. He has his own consulting business, helping disabled people find employment. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, speaking only on condition they not be named, said the policy of rejecting blind applicants after allowing them to take admission tests was not as cynical as it might seem. They said blind applicants were routinely advised that permission for them to take admission tests did not mean that medical standards requiring `` visual acuity'' for all diplomats would be relaxed. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> view under the recent ruling is that all foreign service officers must be `` worldwide available'' and that a blind person can not be expected to deal with the myriad demands diplomats face. One official said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has facilities for helping the blind overcome their handicap but that most foreign countries lack such accommodations. Another said that much of diplomacy involves reading the `` body language'' of foreign envoys during diplomatic discussions. Such gestures as winks and nods form part of the overall message a diplomat must assimilate, the official said. <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON> said the blind are quite capable of picking up `` non-verbal signals.'' Nervousness, he said, `` can be read by projection of voice'' as can a smile. He said the blind are no less able than sighted people to read other people's language, be it `` silent or verbal.'' But a department official said accepting a blind person for diplomatic service `` would be a terribly unfair thing to do to that individual.'' He cited high-risk posts, such as <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, as particularly inappropriate for a sightless person. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankle </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the union of career diplomats, agreed. `` It's dangerous out there,'' <PERSON> Shankle </PERSON> said, emphasizing he was speaking for himself and not the association. `` It's one of the facts of life for the diplomatic service. You have to be constantly on the alert.'' He suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> could resolve the problem by admitting the blind not as career diplomats but as civil servants, who generally do not receive overseas assignments. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jernigan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blind </ORGANIZATION>, has little patience with the arguments of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` Everybody says it's wonderful what blind people can do so long as they work somewhere else,'' <PERSON> Jernigan </PERSON> said from his office in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. He said dealing with reading material is the principal activity of diplomats and blind people are capable of handling `` mountains of paperwork.'' Beyond that, he said, the blind require no more secretarial help than sighted persons. <PERSON> Jernigan </PERSON> added that the federation was prepared to take the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to court but he hoped that recourse could be avoided. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gashel </PERSON>, director of government affairs for the federation, said federal law requires that all government and government-assisted programs conduct their employment practices without discrimination on the basis of handicap. The blind and other disabled persons, he said, must be provided with `` reasonable accommodation'' to help them overcome their handicap. But, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wants a general exemption from this law because of the unique circumstances under which diplomats must work. He said the last time a blind person threatened court action against the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the basis of discrimination, the agency decided on an out of court settlement worth $ 165,000 to the complainant. His account could not be confirmed by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials.

<HEAD>Investigator Hopes to Probe Church Vault for Wedding Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Records of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` shotgun wedding'' may be hidden beneath a disused church near <LOCATION> Stratford-upon-Avon </LOCATION>, says an investigator who probed beneath the floor with radar and optical-fiber photography. `` If you can find where he was married, you might stumble across something else,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON>, 69, is seeking permission from the Redundant Churches Fund to open the vault beneath <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Billesley </LOCATION>, four miles west of <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>. Pictures taken through a fiber-optic probe inserted into the vault show several coffins and what appear to be two chests in the vault. `` If they decide in my favor, we can start work in the new year,'' he said by telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Market </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harborough </LOCATION>, about 50 miles north of the Bard's town. Excavation wo n't prove or disprove the authorship of the plays, a question which <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> considers settled in favor of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>. `` What I want to know, what thousands of people want to know, they want to know about his background, his life. What did he do? Where did he live?'' <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> married <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> in 1582, when the playwright was 18. Their first child, <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON>, was baptized May 26, 1583. A bond dated Nov. 28, 1582, taken as security for the bishop to issue a marriage license, is the principal surviving document of the marriage. `` She was three months pregnant, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> was at the time they married. It was what you would call a shotgun wedding,'' <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> said. Where the couple exchanged vows is a mystery, and two other churches west of <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> are candidates. <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grafton </ORGANIZATION> is listed beside the name of `` <LOCATION> Annam </LOCATION> Whateley,'' intended bride of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, in the bishop's register. <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> believes this is a different <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>; some scholars think the bride's name is just badly misspelled. A 19th century tradition places the marriage at <LOCATION> Luddington </LOCATION>, which like <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grafton </ORGANIZATION> has no records surviving from <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s time. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s pregnancy, <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> said, may account for the couple's choice of a rural church instead of the notoriety of a wedding in <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> The <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> family lived at <LOCATION> Shottery </LOCATION>, a hamlet just west of <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> that had no church. <PERSON> Billesley </PERSON> is one of three churches within a few miles to the west. <PERSON> Billesley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> noted, is just a half-mile from <LOCATION> Wilmcote </LOCATION>, the home of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s mother. <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s only grandchild, took her second husband in the church in <LOCATION> Billesley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> suggests that her first marriage may have been there as well _ following what he believes is a family tradition started by the playwright. It's thought that <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> may have used the library at Billesley Hall, now a tourist inn. The owners have pledged about $ 180 toward the cost of digging into the vault, <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON>, a retired metallurgist, is an old hand at opening tombs. In 1969, he said, he located the grave of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitton </PERSON>, one of the women who may have been the mysterious `` dark lady'' of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s sonnets.

<HEAD>U.S. Foreign Trade Imbalance Improves for Third Consecutive Quarter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A drop in oil prices and higher costs for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products helped provide a 5.4 percent improvement in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade deficit from July through September, the third consecutive quarterly decline this year, the government reported Monday The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the imbalance between what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> imports and what it sells abroad narrowed to $ 28.53 billion in the third quarter, the best showing in 3 -LCB- years. The deficit had fallen by 14.6 percent in the first quarter and declined another 14.3 percent in the second quarter to a revised $ 30.15 billion. Through the first nine months of the year, the deficit is running at an annual rate of $ 125.2 billion, compared with last year's record $ 160.3 billion deficit. Analysts predicted the deficit for all of 1988 should be at least 20 percent lower than 1987, marking the first time since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981 that the trade deficit has shown improvement. That gain has contributed significantly to the economy's momentum, providing almost half of total growth this year But many analysts believe the rapid trade improvement will slow in 1989 and as a result they are looking for a much more sluggish economy next year. `` The trade deficit has definitely turned around, but we ost of his career in government, was tapped by President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Monday to be his press secretary. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he chose <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who was his vice presidential press secretary from 1985 to 1987, because `` I think he's the best.'' The spokesman has received high marks from many reporters covering the White House. But there also have been complaints that he is too easygoing and too often skips his daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> briefings for reporters. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was philosophical about the criticism. `` Facing the White House press corps every day is no day at the beach,'' he said. As to how long he would remain, he said, `` I figure you do this job the way you run the quarter mile. You run as long and hard as you can and as fast as you can, and when you drop they bring in someone else.'' He said the offer from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, which came in a telephone call to his office at 8:30 in the morning, came as a surprise. `` I was making plans to leave,'' he said. He said he planned to call his two children and tell them the news as soon as they got out of school. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s selection marks the first time any incoming president has chosen as his permament press secretary the same individual who did the job for his predecessor. President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON>, stayed on briefly after <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination 25 years ago, but President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> soon replaced him with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> grew up on a farm in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>. As a high school student, he planted tulips at the Eisenhower Library in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION> `` There was a huge picture of <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagerty </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s press secretary -RRB-,'' he said in an interview last year. `` Even then I wondered what it would be like'' to have that job. He landed it in February, 1987, after <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> resigned. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> had taken over the duties from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was seriously wounded in an attempt on the president's life in March, 1981. The job pays $ 77,400 a year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had asked <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> to remain as press secretary, the title that normally goes with the position of presidential spokesman. In the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that title had been reserved for <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. Asked if <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> would have a role in the new administration, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` raised the question internally'' and that the vice president and his advisers `` have some ideas of things they would like him to do.'' From 1981 until 1983, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was press spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, he served nine years as a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> after working as a speechwriter for then-Transportation Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Volpe </PERSON> and at the <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He was a deputy White House press secretary from 1983 to 1985, when he joined the vice president's staff. He was a correspondent and editor with a number of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> newspapers before coming to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> made no commitments as to how often <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would meet with reporters, but said, `` I knew him before to be an open person willing to deal with the press and I think he will be again.''

<HEAD>Judge Summarily Rejects Friedland's Motion For Sentence Reduction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge Monday dismissed as `` absurd'' a former state senator's request for a reduction in his seven-year sentence, saying ex-fugitive <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> has been toying with the legal system for too long. <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON>, convicted of pension fund fraud, contends he should have his sentence reducted to probation because he cooperated with the government, putting his life in danger. His attorney, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaughnessy </PERSON>, also argued that the sentence would have been reduced three years ago, when a reduction first was requested, if <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> had not been indicted a second time for fraud. He said an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney sabotaged chances of a reduction by telling the court of the second case. <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> faces sentencing Friday for his guilty plea on that charge. Both cases involve his bilking of the same Teamsters fund, New Brunswick-based Local 701, at different times. <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON>, 51, feigned a drowning accident weeks before the original sentence reduction hearing in September 1985 and the return of the second fraud indictment. When <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> failed to appear in court, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Debevoise </PERSON> dismissed the reduction motion but gave him a 30-day grace period. <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> was recaptured last December in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> nation of the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> after a globe-trotting year on the run. `` Frankly, I find this an absurd position,'' <PERSON> Debevoise </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON>'s request for a sentence reduction. <PERSON> Debevoise </PERSON> said the `` absurd and irresponsible conduct of the feigned death and flight alone'' was enough to deny the motion. He also cited the fact that while <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> was cooperating with the government, starting in 1982, he was engaged in the second fraud. `` Mr. <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> has been toying with the court system, the justice system, for so many years,'' he said. After his 1980 conviction for receiving payoffs to arrange loans from the pension fund, <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> signed an agreement to cooperate with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in 1982. He subsequently provided information on corruption in <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. His efforts helped convict former Weehawkin Mayor <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsley </PERSON> and did not go much beyond that. `` I think in retropspect it's very hard to say he rendered complete cooperation,'' First Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> said after the hearing. `` This guy was always figuring who he wanted to give up, who he did n't want to give up,'' said <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON>. On Friday, <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> is to appear before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>. He faces a 20-year sentence for his guilty plea, which he entered in September after four days of trial. In that case, <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> was charged with heading a scheme to defraud $ 20 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> pension fund.

 A Cuban human rights activist said Monday that <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> authorities have arrested about 30 people who testified before a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> delegation which reviewed the rights situation on the island two months ago. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bofill </PERSON>, who heads an independent human rights group in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, told reporters the arrests violated a government promise not to punish anyone who provided information to the delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>.

 Israeli soldiers in the occupied lands wounded five rioters Monday during a general strike honoring the 5,000 Palestinians imprisoned in a year of rebellion, hospital officials reported. Dissension increased between rival Palestinian factions in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> over the declaration of an independent state Nov. 15 by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as a legislature for the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Security forces cracked 13 Palestinian guerrilla groups that operated in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a military spokesman said. The groups were responsible for attacks on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and civilians, as well as on Arabs suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said. Troops demolished the homes of 10 of the suspected guerrillas and sealed the homes of three others, the spokesman said. House demolition is a routine punishment meted out to suspected guerrillas. Palestinians scrawled anti-American slogans and pasted up pictures of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to protest the refusal by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to grant <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Rioters at <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> set tires ablaze and flew dozens of outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags in the public market, a maze of alleys and stone-stepped passageways where battles between soldiers and young Arabs are common. Two teen-agers and two men in their 20s suffered bullet wounds, officials at the city's <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> reported. They said one victim was a 17-year-old shot in the stomach. Another 17-year-old was wounded in the right thigh during a confrontation at the Beach refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, officials there reported. At least 316 Palestinians have been killed and more than 7,000 wounded in the uprising, which began Dec. 8, 1987. Eleven Israelis also have been slain. In <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, another <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city, underground leaders of the rebellion distributed leaflets urging merchants to ignore a call by Islamic extremists and a <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction for another strike Tuesday. The purpose of Tuesday's strike is to protest a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan adopted Nov. 29, 1947, for the partition of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> into Jewish and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> implicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by making that and two other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions part of its independence declaration. Underground leaders backed by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> called the strike Monday while more than 300,000 Palestinians _ 20 percent of those living in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> _ were confined to their homes under army curfews. Military spokesmen announced that soldiers demolished several Palestinian homes Monday, but said they had no details. Residents said soldiers put a curfew on El-Khadr, a village near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, and demolished several houses. Townspeople in <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> said troops sealed the house of a 50-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> butcher who was arrested with his son last month for anti-Israeli activism. <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Zeal -RRB- and the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> issued the strike call for Tuesday to protest the nature of the independence declaration. They oppose any negotiations with the Israelis and want all of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> as an independent state, including what is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Leaflets distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> PFLP </ORGANIZATION> over the weekend urged Palestinians to wage a `` a war of Molotov cocktails, acid, knives and stones'' against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. One anti-American slogan painted on a wall in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> said: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the enemy of the Palestinian people.'' Ten American peace and human rights activists visiting the occupied lands met with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consul <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> and handed him a statement criticizing the `` represensible action'' by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` This decision violates the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> charter, seriously damages <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credibility in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and limits opportunities for a political and peaceful solution to the <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict,'' the statement said. The group, which includes representatatives of churches and the <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION>, is on a two-week tour sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Ten New Senators: Looking, Lunching and Lobbying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE GOULD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 10 men who will become new senators in January gathered in the Capitol Monday for a hectic orientation tour that, for Democrats, included lobbying by the three veterans who want their votes for majority leader. `` It's a special day you'll never forget,'' said Sen.-elect <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, D-Wis. `` But it's also like going to college as a freshman. The newly elected senators, five Republicans and five Democrats, were quickly embroiled in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> politics as they eyed coveted committee assignments, prime office locations and other perquisites of life in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. For <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> it was n't necessarily a step up in life. The veteran congressman gave up his position as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> whip to run for, and win, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat vacated by the retiring <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>. `` You look at the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and there certainly are a lot of differences,'' <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> said. `` Like why it takes three months in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to move in 10 guys, when in the House they move in 43 people in 30 days.'' The five freshmen Democrats had n't even had time to sit down for lunch before being lobbied by the three men who want their votes Tuesday when the majority party elects its leaders. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> announced he would support Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> for the job because `` he's a person I'm confortable with.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> said he had n't made up his mind and called it `` the first major decision I'll have to make as a senator.'' `` I honestly do n't know them very well,'' <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said. `` They're all saying roughly the same thing. It comes down to a decision in your gut.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 55, also picked up the endorsements of Sens. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> over the weekend. But Sens. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, 56 of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> also have support and no one is predicting the outcome. `` I have n't the vaguest notion who's going to win,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill. `` There must be 75 of us if you add up the promised votes,'' he said, suggesting that some of the 55 Democrats were playing multiple choice in the verbal straw balloting `` My experience, my seniority should be in my favor,'' <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said in an interview Sunday. `` Clearly, my centrist approach is an advantage,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. `` It would be a good message for the country, it would be a good message for the Democratic party.'' Most of the freshmen were more interested in lobbying for office space and committee assignments, and in finding their way through the labyrinth of hallways, corridors and subways that honeycomb the Capitol. Senator-elect <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Republican who unseated veteran Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, was n't too concerned with seeking out plum offices and assignments. Under complicated <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules and procedures, he stands at the bottom of the seniority ladder. `` Everybody's worrying about numbers _ whether they'll be number 97, 98 or whatever,'' said <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. `` I said, ` Boys, you ca n't get any lower than 100.''' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> had n't yet acquired the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> uniform of dark suit, red tie and cufflinks. The former farm radio broadcaster showed up in brown pants, a sportcoat and Western belt buckle and said he was busy `` getting your feet on the ground, learning what you can do and what you ca n't do.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said that, despite the rounds of meetings, receptions, introductions, tours and speeches, `` it's a very personal day, a red-letter day for me. My father and mother were immigrants. Sixty five years ago they had nothing, and now their son is a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> senator.'' `` That's what I was thinking about as I listened to <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> speak,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said, referring to Democratic Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` I feel the sense of history,'' said <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>. `` It's not going to be an easy time to be a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> senator,'' he said, citing budget deficits, taxes and environmental problems. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, an eight-year <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> veteran, was asked if he had any advice for the freshman Class of 1989. `` I'll tell them to pray a lot,'' he said with a grin.

<HEAD>Solidarity Agrees to Terms for TV Debate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Both sides have agreed to terms for a nationally televised debate Wednesday night between Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the head of the official trade union alliance, a Solidarity spokesman said. The debate between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> is to take place immediately after the main evening news show. If it comes off as planned, it would be the first time that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has ever been allowed to appear live on state-controlled Polish television to present his reasons for wanting the banned union made legal again. <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, Solidarity's national spokesman, said he reached agreement Monday on general terms for the meeting during a telephone conversation with <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>'s representative, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogutyn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bogutyn </PERSON> and the television director, <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tumanowicz </PERSON>, were not immediately available for comment, according to spokesmen at their offices. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, who is also a member of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party Politburo, told a news conference that he was ready for the debate on trade union issues <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also said he is ready to face <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>. `` I've already bought tickets for the morning train'' to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, speaking by telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said the Solidarity side agreed to his federation's proposals that the debate be broadcast live from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> be allowed to speak first, that there will be no moderator, and that <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> mutually decide how the tape of the broadcast would be used in the future According to <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, the official union did not oppose a Solidarity proposal that film director <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wajda </PERSON> be allowed to have a film crew inside the state TV studio and make a backup tape of the debate, but said it would leave that decision to TV officials. `` We would expect TV to agree,'' <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said. Solidarity says it needs such a backup as a record, in case state TV somehow manipulates the broadcast to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s disadvantage. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s last appearance on Polish TV was in 1983 when he was allowed to speak from the floor at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> after a speech by then-Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, who became <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s prime minister in September, answered <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was cut off when he tried to reply. <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> proposed the TV debate with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Nov. 14 during an interview with the official communist party daily <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>'s federation says it represents 7 million Polish workers. The official unions were formed by the government in 1982 to replace Solidarity, outlawed following the 1981 martial-law crackdown. Solidarity has remained active despite the ban, and argues that it should be relegalized alongside the official unions. <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> maintains there should be only one union in one enterprise and says Solidarity supporters should join his unions and attempt to influence them from within.

The council acts as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rejection of his visa application `` a sheer violation of international law'' and `` a grave violation of the 1947 headquarters treaty'' between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> chose to ignore international approval of the new Palestinian policy. Palestinian officials say 67 nations have declared support for an independent Palestine. Only <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has welcomed a statement by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> denying the visa on grounds that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was `` an accessory'' to terrorism `` by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> elements.'' An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said: `` Maybe now part of the world will have to re-examine the situation and take another look at the record of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. It's quite a bloody record.'' In his comments to journalists Monday, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> was seeking to have the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> debate on the Palestinian issue, scheduled to begin Thursday, moved to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> so the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman could attend. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s official daily Al-Sha' b said in an editorial: `` This American decision against Palestinians and <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> and many other countries in the world aims at suffocating the moderate and positive Palestinian voice ... the voice of peace that everyone in the Arab world is calling for.'' Arab criticism of the visa refusal was echoed by communist nations and by Western allies of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which urged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to reconsider. President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally who supports moving the debate, also said he had asked <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to change the decision. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said he hoped `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will respond because that will help to push the peace process in the region.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> declarations, which include renunciation of violence outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupied territory, `` the last chance for peace'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and other Arab nations in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region asked <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to revise a decision `` which does not harmonize with its principles of peace, justice and harmony inthe world,'' a Saudi official said in a statement carried by the kingdom's official news agancy. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which has feuded with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> for years, accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of favoritism toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and declared: `` We all know ... the Americans laud the strong and despise the weak.'' <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> Osaimi </PERSON>, Kuwaiti minister for state for foreign affairs, summoned <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> to `` express <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s deep regret.'' A government statement said <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> was told the decision `` does not conform with the responsibilities of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its role toward the world community in preserving world peace and stability.'' In <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> expressed `` surprise and astonishment.'' <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should `` revise its unjustified decision ... to prove its credibility in a serious quest for a just and lasting settlement.'' <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayed </PERSON>, foreign undersecretary of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, said reconsidering the decision was `` a necessity to bolster the efforts exerted for establishing a just and lasting peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>'s parliamentary urged Arab and Islamic governments, along with `` peace-loving countries,'' to make a unified response to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action. It said denying a visa was `` no response to the positive steps that the Palestinian leadership took and the sincere desire it demonstrated for ... a just peace.''

 The government announced Monday the inflation rate has risen to 26 percent in October, despite an austerity program that began two months ago. The new figure is the highest monthly inflation rate since the 1950s and likely will continue rising through December, the official <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said. In September, government leaders began an austerity drive designed to curb inflation below 10 percent. However, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted the bureau as saying panic buying in August and September has `` almost ended'' and bank savings, which went down sharply, was returning to normal. Authorities have imposed rationing after reports of panic buying of textiles in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and salt in 19 other areas. The inflation statistics came as the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restructuring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION>, which has charted economic reforms, and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, in charge of economic planning, met on Monday. A television news broadcast said Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and Vice Premier <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON>, who head the commissions respectively, reported progress was being made but more work was needed to reign in the overheated economy. The report did not say if the commissions were considering new measures to reduce inflation. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Youfeng </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s retail price index in October was 26.1 percent higher than in October 1987. The last time <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> released comparable figures, it said June prices were up 19 percent over June 1987. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said prices in October were up 17 percent from Jan. 1 and the annual inflation rate is believed to be about 40 percent. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has said that September retail prices in the southern commercial city of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> were up 44 percent from a year earlier, and inflation in other cities also was above the national average. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has not experienced such high inflation since the initial years after World War II and the 1949 communist takeover. Although inflationary pressures existed, the government kept prices artificially low and subsidized farmers and factories. In recent years, the government has raised some prices and decontrolled others in an effort to develop a market-style economy. Prices have been pushed up by growing industrial demand for limited raw materials, fuel and transport services, as well as by high consumer demand for household appliances. In addition, inflation was fueled by widespread hoarding and profiteering. In an effort to curb demand, the government in late September ordered a halt to thousands of construction projects nationwide and told government offices to cut spending. However, industrial output still grew more than 20 percent in October over the previous year, indicating the policies have not yet been effective.

<HEAD>FBI Tried To Buy Employment Lists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> tried to buy names of unemployed workers in the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> area last year in hopes of tracking down fugitives, but <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Employment Division officials rejected the request, a newspaper reported Monday. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials said the proposal was a routine technique for catching criminals, but an employee approached at the division's office in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>'s Skid Row said she was concerned about violating the confidentiality of the agency's mostly impoverished clientele, the Salem Statesman-Journal reported in a copyright story Monday `` I'm all for helping the police and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>. `` But on the other hand, this is a homeless shelter where individuals come and want to feel safe. I would have felt like a spy if I sold their names. That's the most dishonest thing I personally could have done.'' Employment Division director W.E. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> disclosed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal after a division worker in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> was fired last month for notifying law enforcement officials that a client was wanted on a probation violation charge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulsey </PERSON>, a 12-year veteran of the division, has appealed her firing. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said she violated the division's privacy policy, which he re-emphasized after the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal was made last year. In October 1987, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents tried to obtain lists of unemployed people visiting the state office in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>'s Skid Row. That action was part of a national <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> effort to purchase names, Social Security numbers and birth dates of clients and employees of private companies and government agencies, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON>, a special agent in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> office. The state agency said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> wanted more than lists of clients. If the names of fugitives appeared on the lists, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> wanted division workers to contact the fugitives and tell them to visit the downtown office for job interviews, according to state officials. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents would be waiting to arrest the job applicants. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> rejected the request on the advice of his staff and an assistant state attorney general who said it could violate state privacy laws and endanger division employees. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> offered to pay $ 2 for the name of each client and $ 300 to $ 400 for a name if it turned out to be that of a wanted felon, division officials said. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said he would be willing to release such information on a case-by-case basis. `` But they wanted more than just information,'' he said. `` This was a sting-like operation.'' During the past 20 years, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has caught thousands of fugitives by feeding such information into a national computer system that checks the data against a list of about 25,000 currently wanted criminals, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>, the assistant special agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> office.

 Saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to bar <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> from the country was `` firm and final,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday gave its reluctant consent to moving the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> debate on Palestinian issues to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. There the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> could air his views despite a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> finding that he was an `` accessory'' to acts of terrorism against Americans and did not qualify for a visa to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It's unnecessary,'' department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said of the attempt by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> diplomats to move part of this year's General Assembly session to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. He said other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials present in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> could speak for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s group and, besides, a shift to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> would be costly. But, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> acknowledged, if the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> decided to move the debate out of the country `` the same factors would not be applied in the same way.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would not require <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> permission in order to speak, and the judgment of <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, director of the department's office to counter terrorism, that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has not renounced terrorism would not be applicable. `` While we do not favor such a move we do not oppose it,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. He called discussion of a shift at this point only hypothetical. The decision to bar <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was made Saturday by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Turning down an appeal from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for favorable consideration, he concluded that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` knows of, condones and lends support'' to terrorist acts against Americans by units of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the dominant group in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` He is, therefore, an accessory to such terrorism,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. The rebuff provoked criticism from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and several Western European and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments as well as allegations the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not living up to the terms of its 1947 agreement to be the host for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, however, `` this is a question of terrorism, security and the security of American citizens.'' The spokesman said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> conditioned its acceptance of the 1947 agreement on the right to bar entry of aliens `` in order to safeguard its own security.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> sought, meanwhile, to separate the issue of a visa for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> from problems in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. He said `` probably no other country in the world has worked as hard at the peace process as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made four trips to the area this year in an unsuccessful effort to promote negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a joint delegation of Jordanian and Palestinian Arabs. `` We do not oppose the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> considering the Palestinian question,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` It's an important matter.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diploamts would participate in any <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> debate. Meanwhile, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intended no affront to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> by denying <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s request for a visa. Briefing reporters at the White House a day after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that he agreed `` very much'' with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s decision, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` we were making no kind of statement about the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, but about <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and terrorism.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> took questions on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> issue shortly after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, that the administration had violated international law. `` I do n't think many Americans are having much trouble understanding this decision,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tait </PERSON>, spokeswoman for President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was informed of the decision and `` stands behind it'' as a member of the administration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not respond to a shouted question on the matter during a White House appearance Monday. On Sunday, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said he had not been consulted in advance of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s announcement.

<HEAD>Midwest, Northwest, Appalachia Could Get Welcome Moisture</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Snows this winter could provide welcome relief to drought-plagued areas of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> projected Monday. The Southeast and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, meanwhile, appear likely to bask in warmer than normal weather for the next three months, according to the long-range forecast for December through February. `` This particular season, we think, is more likely to be warm than cold, more likely to be wet than dry,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, the agency's chief long-range forecaster. Large areas of the middle of the country, including the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> plains </LOCATION>, remain a major question mark, however, with the forecast too close to call in those regions, <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> said. A major factor in the prediction is a pattern of cooler than normal ocean temperatures in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> said. Unlike years when this area has been warm, the cooler conditions tend to steer weather systems from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and into the Southeastern states, pumping warm air into that region. But <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> pointed out that conditions in the northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> are unsettled, and changes there could upset the outlook for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the Northwest. `` This is a zone of great doubt,'' he said. The best news is likely that there is little severe cold in the forecast, <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> said. But, asked if that means that the warmer than normal conditions of the past summer were continuing, he said no. The above normal winter temperature forecast is not a continuation of that pattern, nor is it a result of overall climate warming, he said. For some drought-affected regions the outlook for a wet winter is good news, he said. `` The <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> outlook is favorable for helping recharge the soil.'' The strongest chance for wetter than normal weather is in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> forecast. Also anticipating a wet winter should be <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Dry conditions are expected from <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> eastward through <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the southern portions of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The outlook is too close to call in other areas, including the northern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states, which have also suffered from drought this year. But, <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> noted, in that region the heaviest precipitation is usually in spring rather than winter, so the farming outlook could still be good for next year. Turning to temperatures, the only region with a below normal outlook is <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Warmer than normal conditions are expected in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, most of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and all states to the south and east of those. The odds of warmer than usual weather increase to the south and east, the forecast notes.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nicaraguan rebel commander Monday said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government has ended an eight-month cease-fire by staging offensive military operations in eastern and northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` We have alerted our combatants that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are declaring war,'' said <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> in a broadcast over the rebels' clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberacion </ORGANIZATION>. The director of the rebels' Nicaraguan Resistance umbrella organization also said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> received new shipments of Soviet military aid since August. These included large numbers of ground-based AC-2 and AC-3 missiles and Mi-17 helicopters, he said. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> accused the government of seeking a military advantage over the rebels, who have gone without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted to cut off lethal aid in February. Since 1981 the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has supported the rebels, known as Contras, in their bid to overthrow the leftist government. In March, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and Contras signed a cease-fire agreement in the southern town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. Talks on a permanent truce broke down in September and each side accuses the other of cease-fire violations. `` The Sandinistas are saying that the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> accords ended definitively and that they are not going to continue negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>. He said the Sandinista army was conducting offensives against Contra forces in the northern province of <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION> and eastern Chontales province. `` We are going to continue defending ourselves in cases when we're attacked,'' he said. Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the army was `` fulfilling the orders of President -LRB- <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> regarding the end to offensive military operations, but we must be ready to reject with force each criminal action that the Contras make.'' He was quoted Monday in the pro-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>. A government official Sunday said four Contras were killed in a clash with government troops east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the capital. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldera </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> representative in Chontales, also said 12 soldiers and defense ministry personnel and eight civilians have been killed in rebel ambushes over the past two months. Another 22 people, including 10 rebels and 12 civilian militia, died Wednesday when guerrillas battled local defense forces in the remote hamlet of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guabo </LOCATION>, 137 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the government said.

Transition sources said they expect the naming of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> as commerce secretary later this week. However, the vice president gave no clue as to when he'd name additional Cabinet choices. He showed up unexpectedly at <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s usual 11:30 a.m. briefing in the White House to announce his decision to retain the 46-year-old career government spokesman, who had been his press secretary in 1985-87. `` I think he's the best,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He represents the old and the new. He represents the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and he also represents the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. ... This is continuity in the best sense.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, with his own brand of self-deprecating humor, called the offer `` a wonderful opportunity'' but added, `` I think I represent the old and the older.'' `` The transition should be a smooth one,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> joked. `` I have a lot of ideas for my successor, but I have n't had a chance to think about them yet.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the new president would have news conferences `` as regular as possible.'' `` It's a new administration, a new president. I'm sure we'll have new ways of dealing with the press. I'm sure there'll be all kinds of interviews and press conferences and meetings,'' he added. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> has had the title assistant to the president for press relations since Febuary 1987, when he succeeded <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> would be retained as `` press secretary,'' that title is actually still held by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was wounded in the March 1981 assassination attempt on the president. When asked whether <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> would have a role in the new administration, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I know the vice president is very interested in <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and concerned about his well being'' and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his advisers `` have some ideas of things they would like him to do.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> would remain <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary through the transition, and he would take over on Jan. 20. Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> has said she plans to leave government. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> telephoned him early Monday, `` made the offer and I quickly accepted.'' At lunch, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> dined alone for awhile, then were joined by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice for budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, for a discussion of budget issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hoped to work with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as well as with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders in forging a compromise to ease the government's budget deficit. `` We're going to address this budget deficit early on,'' he said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who said during the primary campaign that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should `` stop lying about my record,'' said Monday, `` We've both been through some pretty rough campaigns.'' Now, he said, `` the election is over. I vowed to the president-elect we'd work together.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he had gotten `` some very good ideas'' from <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on dealings with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` Neither of us is naive. There'll probably be some times when we differ with the majority party up there,'' he said. But he added that he was confident he could work as president with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders in both <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` and reach out to the Democrats as well.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the two just `` talked generally about timing'' but that as soon as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to get into specifics `` I'll be happy to round up some senators and go to work.'' Asked whether taxes needed to be raised to eliminate the deficit, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> responded with a flat `` no.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who voiced repeated opposition to new taxes during his campaign and has talked of freezing overall federal spending at the rate of inflation, said he would talk about specific budget cuts `` later on, but nobody's going to get home scot-free on these things. Everyone knows that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to meet with other <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans at the Capitol Tuesday morning, and was to attend a congressional <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> dinner at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday night.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> set an invisible countdown clock in motion Monday for Thursday's launch of space shuttle Atlantis with five military men who reportedly will deploy the $ 500 million Lacrosse satellite to spy on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the Pentagon say the flight and its cargo are top-secret, but reports have circulated widely about the satellite, and even the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has discussed the mission through its news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. The weather could be a problem for launch day. A preliminary forecast for Thursday called for overcast sky, brisk winds and isolated rainshowers _ unfavorable conditions that would prevent <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> from giving the go-ahead for liftoff. The astronauts flew here Monday afternoon from their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and their commander, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, told reporters, `` We're ready to go; the crew is excited about the mission, and we're anxious to be under way.'' He said he hoped for good weather on Thursday. The crew members have been instructed not to discuss their mission publicly, and when a reporter shouted a question about the flight, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> smiled and replied, `` Good to see you.'' The pilot is Air Force Lt. Col. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, and the mission specialists are Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON> and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>. The countdown started shortly after midnight, but because the mission is classified, countdown displays normally monitored by the news media were blank. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> made periodic reports that all was well but said they wanted to keep the precise progress of the count secret to hide the exact time of launch. No information has been made public about the number or length of planned `` holds,'' when the clock would normally be stopped. Officials have said <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> will lift off sometime between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. Thursday. Reliable sources have said the launch will occur about 7 a.m. if weather and other conditions are adequate. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials contend the secrecy makes it more difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships operating off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> to monitor the flight and learn its purpose. Critics argue that such secrecy is unnecessary because the Soviets, with their intelligence capabilities, already know a great deal about the mission. In fact, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday: `` The main task of the secret mission is to put into near-Earth orbit a new generation reconnaissance satellite, codenamed Lacrosse. The satellite will conduct surveillance of the territory of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with the help of updated radar. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> plans to deploy in the next few years four other similar spy satellites which will play the role of an ` eye' for the new strategic bomber B-2, known as stealth.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> critics also say that once <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>' satellite is in its own orbit, the Soviets will be able to track it precisely and know what it is doing. Knowledgeable sources report the satellite will gather extremely sharp radar images of Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and Soviet military targets as it follows a course that covers 80 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A major assignment will be to help <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> intelligence officials verify <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> compliance with arms control treaties. The sources say the satellite is huge, that it weighs more than 30,000 pounds and, once deployed, it will extend two solar panels to a span of 150 feet. They say its radar will be able to penetrate clouds and they estimate the cost at more than $ 500 million. The flight will be the 27th for the shuttle program, the third dedicated totally to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the second since the Challenger explosion that killed seven crew members in January 1986. The secrecy about Atlantis' launch contrasts sharply with the fanfare that surrounded last September's flight of Discovery on the first post-Challenger mission.

 An attorney plans to argue Wednesday for a new trial for <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, whose guilt in the killing of a policeman was questioned by the documentary film `` The Thin Blue Line.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was convicted nine years ago of the 1976 murder of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, and sentenced to death for the slaying. His sentence later was commuted to life in prison. `` The Thin Blue Line'' suggests that police and prosecutors virtually framed <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> by suppressing evidence of his innocence and using five questionable witnesses. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>, contends <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> did not receive a fair trial, largely because prosecutors did not turn over documents favorable to the defense, as required by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> also said he plans to use evidence generated in the making of the film at the hearing. <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> said he will question the credibility of five witnesses who testified against <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, including key witness <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> originally testifed that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> shot Wood while <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> were riding together in a stolen car. But <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> now claims that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was not even in the car when the fatal shots were fired. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> has essentially admitted in the past month that he committed the capital murder of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> wrote in his application for a writ of habeas corpus, which would bring the case to court again. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> -RRB- has been incarcerated for almost 12 years for an offense which he did not commit.'' <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> is asking state District Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> to recommend a new trial and <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' release pending the trial.

<HEAD>Pentagon Plans Major Survey on Sex Harassment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is about to launch one of the most extensive surveys ever undertaken to spotlight sexual harassment in the workplace. The written survey will be distributed in December to more than 34,000 men and women on active duty in the armed forces, plus 4,000 in the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, an agency of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It will ask if they have ever been the victims of `` uninvited, unwanted sexual attention.'' By contrast, the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted a similar survey among civilian government workers last year, polled a sample of about 13,000 full-time federal workers and received responses from 8,500. The military survey was ordered last February by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> in response to a recommendation from a special task force. The panel concluded that sexual harassment was a serious problem for women in the armed forces and that the services should open additional jobs to females. Maj. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Super </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the confidential survey will be distributed to 8,900 enlisted personnel and officers in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, 8,900 in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, 8,600 in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, 7,700 in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and 4,000 in the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Approximately 21,000 men and 17,000 women are slated to receive the questionnaires. Researchers hope some preliminary results will be available by April, but a final report is not expected before June, <PERSON> Super </PERSON> said. The spokesman said the questions in the four-part survey are designed to determine whether sexual harassment has been a problem in the past and how serious a problem it is today. Service members who have been harassed within the previous 12 months will be asked to provide details of the experience. Respondents will be asked to offer a frank appraisal of how their work productivity was affected by any incident of sexual harassment; whether they reported the alleged harassment and requested any type of investigation, and in what region of the country or area of the world the incident occurred. Completion of the survey will be voluntary, but the response rate is expected to be high because the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> will ask military commanders around the world to encourage participation. The survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which was released in July, concluded that sexual harassment in the civilian government world was `` pervasive, costly and systemic.'' The board said 42 percent of women and 14 percent of men who responded to its survey of federal employees said they experienced some form of sexual harassment from May 1985 to May 1987. That figure was virtually identical to findings in the board's 1980 survey. Super said the $ 35,000 <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> survey should provide basic information to defense officials about how serious the problem of sexual harassment is inside the military, the effectiveness of existing regulations and what changes might be helpful.

<HEAD>Harvard Professor Resigns After Allegation of Plagiarism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A graduate student reading 20-year-old medical journals discovered plagiarized passages that have resulted in the resignation from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> of one of the nation's top psychiatrists, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> official said Monday. Dr. <PERSON> Shervert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, a former head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, resigned last week as a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professor and director of <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a psychiatric hospital affiliated with the university. The resignation followed an investigation by the medical school's <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which concluded that plagiarism occurred in four papers written by <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> and published between 1966 and 1975, according to a letter from <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tosteson </PERSON> to the medical school faculty The letter, dated Nov. 23, was made public by the university Monday. Both <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tosteson </PERSON> were out of town and unavailable for comment Monday, said <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelstein </PERSON>, dean of academic programs at the medical school, said <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, 67, did not dispute the committee's findings but said the plagiarism resulted from lax methods, not deceptive intent. `` He said that when he read a paper, he would copy parts of it out,'' <PERSON> Adelstein </PERSON> said. Later, `` he put the cards together and was not always as careful as he should have been,'' the dean said. `` If you look at these papers, what you see is that there are paragraphs within them that are more or less verbatim from some other places,'' <PERSON> Adelstein </PERSON> said. The articles were brought to the attention of school officials in August by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Scatena </PERSON>, a 28-year-old graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> who was researching medical literature on pain. <PERSON> Scatena </PERSON> said Monday that he was pleased by the job <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> did checking out his complaints. He said he sent copies of the articles to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, using `` color-coded highlighting'' to note the similarities. `` I'm very glad that <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> seems to be in the forefront of tackling some of these ethical issues that are plaguing science these days,'' <PERSON> Scatena </PERSON> said. Three of the four papers are about phantom pain, the burning sensation that people sometimes feel from a limb that has been amputated. The fourth is on `` psychiatric emergency management.'' The plagiarized portions were taken from earlier articles in Scientific American, Clinical Neurosurgery and other publications. <PERSON> Adelstein </PERSON> said the four papers appeared in medical review journals or textbooks, including the American Handbook of Psychiatry. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> was a professor of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> from 1972 until 1984, when he left to become director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md. He held that post for two years before returning to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> to head <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, one of the nation's leading psychiatric hospitals He has also worked at the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, among other institutions. He is a former commissioner of mental health and mental retardation in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Public Affairs. `` The university takes very seriously any charges of plagiarism because that's what we're about _ the search for truth and knowledge,'' <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> said. In his letter to the faculty, <PERSON> Tosteson </PERSON> wrote that the committee could not determine whether any other writing by <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> had been plagiarized.

<HEAD>Military Says Marcos Supporters Staged Attempted Coup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police charged five people with illegal assembly after what the military said was an attempt by supporters of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to stage a mass uprising like the one that toppled their exiled leader. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> brushed aside Saturday's events, in which troops turned back bus and jeep convoys carrying about 1,000 civilians into the city with leaflets promising a `` constitutional military government.'' Military officials said the convoy was organized by supporters of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since he was ousted in a 1986 popular uprising. Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said convoy leaders planned to surround military garrisons in the capital, much like the February 1986 uprising that propelled Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. But he said there was no evidence any soldiers had joined the convoys, made up mostly of civilians from agricultural areas near <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. `` They were just making noises and they wanted to be noticed,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. `` I guess people will keep on trying -LRB- to undermine the government -RRB-, but I think they should realize now that the people are against them and they will not support them in something like this.'' Officials said most of those in the convoy were allowed to return home after police questioning, but five people were charged on Monday with illegal assembly. Police were looking for the alleged ringleader, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said troops remained on alert Monday as a precaution. Troops armed with semi-automatic rifles and machine guns were seen guarding roadblocks on the eastern edge of the capital. <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said leaflets confiscated from the convoy offered rewards of up to $ 200,000 for the capture of senior military officers loyal to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Participants were offered money to join the convoy and were told they would attend rallies at the presidential palace and elsewhere to protest `` economic grievances,'' Oxales said. Participants also were given `` liberation bonds'' they were told could be redeemed after the new government was installed, <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said. Authorities have foiled a half dozen coup attempts against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The most serious took place Aug. 28, 1987, when about 2,000 mutineers attacked military and media facilities in the capital. At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded. Mutiny leader Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was arrested in December 1987 but escaped in April.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> says he has delivered to the White House a petition containing about 2 million signatures urging President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to pardon Iran-Contra figure <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> said a pardon would save the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration years of trouble. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said the legal process should be allowed to run its course in the North case. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> did not respond immediately Monday to a telephone inquiry about whether the petition prompted any reaction from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>.

North's trial is expected to start early next year.

<HEAD>Ethiopia Moving 600,000 Peasants into Villages by June</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Marxist government plans to move 600,000 peasants into villages by June, the <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The new program would bring to 14.9 million the number of people relocated in villages since the program begun four years ago, the state news agency said. That would be 40 percent of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s rural population, <ORGANIZATION> ENA </ORGANIZATION> said. The new quota was approved during a weekend meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Villagization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chaired by Prime Minister <PERSON> Fikre-Selassie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wogderess </PERSON>. The program would include 12 of the nation's 14 administrative provinces, it said. It did not identify the two uninvolved provinces but government sources identified them as <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> _ two neighboring northern regions plagued by civil war. Secessionist Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oldest civil war while Tigrean guerrillas took up arms 14 years ago to press demands for autonomy. <ORGANIZATION> ENA </ORGANIZATION> said plans involve building 341 primary schools, with construction of 231 to be financed by the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the only international organization helping the program. Most relief and aid organizations operating in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> have refused to get involved in the relocation program because of previous allegations peasants were forced to leave their homes, some at gunpoint. President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>'s government has admitted making some mistakes, but promised this year that future exercises would be strictly voluntary. Critics say peasants are taken to ill-prepared barrack-like villages where there often are none of the schools, health clinics, and piped water which the government says it can provide to centralized communities. Officials say they can not bring such necessities to traditionally isolated parents with neighbors living miles apart in often rugged terrain accessible only by foot or mule. The government's opponents say it wants to use the program it calls `` villagization'' to give it more control over its 47 million people, who since the 1974 Marxist revolution all are organized by rural farming or urban district associations that control things like food rations. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s agricultural policy is based on establishing state and cooperative farms through centralized villages though they have proved less productive than peasant farmers.

The hull carved a deep trench in the reef, killing coral, and fuel oil and debris damaged the reef, seabed and beaches, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> alleged in a civil complaint filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Hawksbills, more than any other turtle species, depend heavily on healthy coral reef habitat for shelter and food, said the complaint, adding that much of the hope for their survival and recovery depends on maintaining nesting beaches and foraging habitat. Under a proposed consent decree reached with <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steamship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indemnity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Bermuda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the insurance company will pay $ 4.03 million to remove the ferry and clean up debris. The commonwealth of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> also is a party to the consent decree, under which it will receive at least $ 641,000 for damages to its natural resources, cleanup costs and future costs related to the removal project. The consent decree was filed simultaneously with the complaint against <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steamship </ORGANIZATION> and Armatur, <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Tourship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, S.A., the owners and operators of the ferry. `` The agreement provides an excellent plan to prevent further damage to the ecology and to improve protection of sea turtles that live on and around <LOCATION> Mona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>,'' Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s land and natural resources division, said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation authorizing the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> to transfer a surplus barge to a salvage company to help carry out the removal operation.

<HEAD>Father Seeks Visitation Rights for Daughter Given Away for Adoption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The natural father of a girl who was adopted at birth more than seven years ago asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to restore parental rights he contends were revoked unconstitutionally. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> contends that <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> authorities unconstitutionally denied him the opportunity to raise the girl, who was conceived during a brief romance with a woman that ended eight months before the baby's birth. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, now 42, did not learn that he had become a father until after the infant's birth and the mother sought his consent to put the child, named <PERSON> Katie </PERSON>, up for adoption. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> sought custody soon after he learned of <PERSON> Katie </PERSON>'s birth, but <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> limits the rights of an unwed father to block an adoption. Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> argued that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law unconstitutionally discriminates against unwed fathers by making it more difficult for them to assert rights as parents. `` Mr. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s rights should n't be terminated except on the same grounds as the mother's,'' <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> told the justices, noting that a lower court that denied custody had concluded nevertheless that his client was a loving father of two sons by a previous marriage. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, who is now seeking visitation rights, `` was denied any opportunity to form any relationship with the child'' before she was put up for adoption by the mother, who is not identified in court records. But several justices expressed skepticism over <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s claim that he was denied equal protection or denied his rights when authorities allowed the natural mother to place <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> up for adoption without <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s consent. `` None of our cases hold that a father in your client's position has achieved a protected liberty,'' Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> told <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> questioned why <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> did n't have authority to adopt a policy `` that the state will consider the best interests of the child over the alleged rights of the biological father.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> if <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> could make the same claim if the child's conception `` had been the result of a so-called one-night stand.'' `` If he had perfected all the rights manifesting significant parental interest, he would be entitled'' to make the claim, <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> replied. `` That would go significantly beyond the court's cases, where there had been an established relationship'' between father and child, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, counsel for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, defended <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s policy of giving an unwed mother the primary right to decide whether to surrender a child for adoption. The legal distinction between unwed fathers and unwed mothers furthers the `` state policy which is the speedy placement of children by putting them in suitable settings so they can nurture,'' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> argued. Most unwed fathers are not easily identifiable and `` are not necessarily interested in fatherhood,'' he said. `` Biology in and of itself does not not create a substantial relationship or create a parental right,'' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said. `` There must be something substantial between the father and the child.'' The decision to allow <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> to adopt <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> was `` not an intrusion into an existing family unit. Mr. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> and his daughter were never a family. They never had any relationship.'' `` The most they saw of each other may have been an hour and a half some seven years ago,'' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said. The justices are expected to decide the case by July. Outside the courtroom, Mrs. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, who attended the hearing with her attorney, refused to comment on the case. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said he feels a `` great loss'' by `` not being able to be her father.'' He said he has pursued the lengthy legal battle because `` it is my right to raise my daughter and I am not going to give that right up to anyone.''

 Evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> says his ministries are running in the black after months of red ink that followed reports of his sexual misconduct. And, although <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> Ministries would n't say how much money was brought in by <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s four-day Thanksgiving Camp Meeting, the Thanksgiving Day collection alone totaled $ 400,000. `` I am speechless. I do n't know what to say,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> told the crowd that nearly filled the 7,500-seat Family Worship Center on Thursday night. `` I thank you, you'll never know how much I thank you. My faith has been too little.'' It was the first big crowd at a Swaggart camp meeting since February, when he stepped down from the pulpit for three months after a weepy confession to an unspecified sin. Since then, church attendance and contributions have dropped; some stations have dropped his television show and the Assemblies of God dropped <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and threatened to expel ministries who stay with him. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> surprised the congregation at the camp meeting's opening rally Wednesday by announcing a new contract to broadcast his show in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It will cost the ministry $ 250,000 a month, he said. The Rev. R.W. <PERSON> Schambach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who preached during the meeting's afternoon sessions, told <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> the following evening that the Thanksgiving afternoon crowd had given more than $ 400,000. And in the November issue of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s magazine, `` The Evangelist,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> wrote that the ministries operated in the black during October. `` I've got to shout hallelujah a thousand times over,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> wrote. `` Last month, the month of October, the ministry met its budget ... we paid our bills for that particular month.'' However, he said, debts remain from the summer and he appealed for donations. `` All the miracles we've won for the past 33 years of ministry ... will come to a grinding halt in the next two weeks if we can not pay the television stations the money we owe them,'' he wrote. Noting that January marks the 33rd anniversary of his ministry, he asked people to send contributions in amounts that contained the number 33.

 Tornadoes skipped without warning like a `` big bouncing ball'' across <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s capital city early Monday, smashing homes and churches before heading into rural areas. Four people were killed and at least 151 injured. `` I can remember hearing a big gust of wind like a hurricane and then I could hear the wood tearing and I thought ` Oh God, this is it, I'm gone.' I just buried myself under the bed,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. The storms brought reminders of the 24 twisters that ripped a 250-mile path through the state in 1984, killing 44 people, injuring more than 800 and leaving 2,300 homeless. Monday's twisters destroyed mobile homes, damaged churches, toppled several houses onto their sides and threw power lines onto houses and streets, leaving more 6,500 homes without electricity for several hours. Trees were snapped several feet from the ground along the storm's path. About 500 people were left homeless in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, where the storms struck without any advance notice, said Mayor <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Upchurch </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued no tornado warnings or watches before the tornadoes struck. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedenson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, said insurance companies anticipated a possible loss of $ 30 million in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> from the twisters. The 1984 storms cause $ 65 million in damage. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, said twisters touched down in 17 locations in Wake, <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, Dare, <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pamlico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Currituck </LOCATION> counties. In neighboring <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, one tornado and high wind downed trees, damaged property and knocked out power in Isle of <LOCATION> Wight </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> counties early Monday, but no injuries were reported. The twisters first struck around 1 a.m., flattening a <ORGANIZATION> Raleigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> mart store and four three-story apartment buildings nearby at the start of a 10-mile path of destruction in northern <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` We flew over the area and it looked like a big bouncing ball had gone through there,'' <PERSON> Upchurch </PERSON> said. Three K mart employees in the Raleigh store when the tornado hit were all later rescued. One man was trapped in debris and had to be pulled out. `` I went to the back of the store and saw I could n't make it,'' said K Mart employee <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` I got to the toys and hid.'' Bricks, cinder blocks and twisted steel girders lay in a heap with racks of clothing and other merchandise. Fire departments had crews out combing through damaged homes and apartments in search of other victims. However, said <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> City Manager <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>: `` To our knowledge, all people have been accounted for.'' Of 132 houses damaged, a third were destroyed, he said. <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> police were posted at areas of major damage to prevent looting, authorities said. The <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coordinated donations of blankets and clothing for four temporary shelters set up for people left homeless. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON>, 34, of the Calibre Oaks complex, said he grabbed a pillow and got behind his bedroom door until the tornado passed. `` The roof was totally gone, the patio doors were gone and every window was smashed. The carpet was rolled up like someone was going to replace it,'' he said, adding he had to dig his way out from the corner of the room. The <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has been asked to assess damages to determine if the counties will be eligible for low-interest disaster loans, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. `` What we are trying to do now is assess the damage and determine how to help people affected by the storm,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. Farmers also suffered losses in the storms, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, state Commissioner of Agriculture. Several egg production houses, 12 bulk tobacco barns, 2,000 acres of timber, and two hog operations were destroyed, he said. The victims were identified as <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulghum </PERSON>, 12, of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, 8, of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Nash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Authorities first said six people had been killed. They later said one of the deaths turned out to be unrelated to the storm. The toll was revised downward a second time, to four, after a second check of <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> hospitals, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Response </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release.

<HEAD>Decision Expected Soon In River-Dredging Controversy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> environmental officials expect to decide soon whether to grant a controversial 25-year dredging permit for the <LOCATION> Apalachicola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, considered vital by shipping interests in three states. But the permit requested by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> is opposed by nearly everyone else, including environmentalists and fishing interests. `` If navigation survives and prospers, the economy of the region benefits,'' said <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirt </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> in this <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> river town. <PERSON> Hirt </PERSON> also is interim executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Tri-Rivers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waterway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is lobbying for the permit on behalf of shippers in the <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Environmentalists oppose the permit because they believe 25 years is too long and because they contend the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> has failed to state exactly what it plans to do. They also are worried that the dredging would destroy habitat for fish and wildlife. Corps biologist <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Flakes </PERSON> said the agency will safeguard the environment and that it has indicated what it intends to do through publication of a navigation maintenance plan. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> is expected to make an internal decision in a few days, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, a spokesman for the agency. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1939 authorized the corps to maintain a navigation channel in the river 100 feet wide and 9 feet deep, keeping both the river and its northern tributaries, the <LOCATION> Chattahoochee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> rivers in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, open to traffic. But the corps still must obtain permits from each of the states for dredging and removing snags such as fallen trees. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which benefits least from the river traffic but has the most to lose from an environmental standpoint, has used its muscle over the years to reject some proposals and demand concessions before approving others. Such permits usually are granted for no more than five years. A 25-year permit is unprecedented. The corps' current two-year permit expires Jan. 31. Opposing the permit request are the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Defenders of the Environment, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Game and <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Apalachee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Environmental Groups To Play Bigger Role In Crafting Next Farm Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Environmental groups are going to have more to say than ever before about what goes into the next farm bill, two analysts said Monday. The environment probably would benefit from the abolition of all government farm programs if current conservation incentives were retained, said the study by Resources for the Future, an environmental research organization. But would those benefits outweigh the social costs to farmers? `` The answer is probably not,'' said <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichelderfer </PERSON>, one of two authors of the study published through the research group's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> and Agricultural Policy Such a policy would `` increase the number of acres planted to crops, but would result in environmentally beneficial relocation and mix of production activities, with less intensive and less damaging use of agricultural chemicals on expanded acreage,'' the study said. But it added, `` farm income would decline, agricultural exports would fall and rural communities and agribusiness interests would suffer.'' In the last revision of farm programs in 1985, environmentalists were influential in forbidding benefits to farmers who convert grassland and swamps to crops and in establishing a conservation reserve in which farmers are paid rent to conat strikers occupying company facilities held more than 173,000 boxes of bananas destined for export. It said each box was worth $ 10. <PERSON> Yanez </PERSON> charged that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> was sponsoring radio advertisements offering unemployed Hondurans jobs. Honduran labor laws forbid employers to hire laborers to replace striking workers. The company also has distributed leaflets from helicopters at the plantations urging strikers to return to work, union officials said. Leaders of other Honduran unions declared their support for the banana pickers' strike. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campesino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> was ready to join the strikers if necessary, said association president <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>. `` We have more than 25,000 laborers -LRB- available -RRB- to defend the strike'' at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The Coordinating Council of Campesino organizations of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, with more than 300,000 members, also declared its support Monday.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers ended nearly two weeks of tense discussions Monday with a formal agreement to limit production and pump prices back toward the cartel's benchmark of $ 18 per barrel. But before the day was out, one oil minister indicated his new quota was not official, causing prices to back off after a sharp runup. The accord, which ended the winter meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, set an output ceiling of 18.5 million barrels a day for the 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members, well under the 22.5 million that analysts estimate the cartel is currently pumping. The agreement also resolved a key issue in the talks by giving former combatants <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> equal quotas of 2.64 million barrels a day. After the agreement was announced, futures prices for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brand, jumped as high as $ 15.80 dollars a barrel, up more than $ 1.80 from its close last week on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. But prices slipped toward the end of the day after the oil minister of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> said the output level set in the accord was not his official ceiling. The price of West Texas Intermediate for January delivery still managed to settle up $ 1.06 per barrel at $ 15.03. A pickup in crude prices _ if it holds _ could mean higher gasoline prices at the pump, although oil companies do not necessarily pass along the full increase. Each one dollar rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means a pickup of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices. The agreement takes effect Jan. 1 for six months. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> predicted prices could reach $ 18 a barrel `` maybe by June.'' `` I would n't mind it tomorrow,'' he told a news conference, `` but it's not possible.'' He said that if the countries cut their production as required, prices will get a strong lift. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s oil minister, <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, predicted the accord `` will have a very positive effect on the oil market.'' <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s oil minister, <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartasasmita </PERSON>, predicted the $ 18 mark could be reached by next winter. `` It's a victory for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Raheem </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Chalabi </PERSON>, oil minister of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Feredoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkeshli </PERSON>, senior Iranian delegate, said, `` I'm happy about it.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which until the agreement had vowed never to permit <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> an equal quota, had a cap of 2.4 million under the cartel's previous agreement and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, 1.5 million. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> retains its 14.27 percent share of total <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> output under the new accord. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has the same portion. Other countries, however, lost a bit of their share to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest exporter, was given a 24.5 percent share of total output, compared to 26.2 percent previously. Its daily quota will be 4.52 million barrels, up from 4.34 million barrels. The new agreement promises steps will be taken to try to keep prices up and countries from cheating on their quotas. Past <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreements have unraveled when the members cheated by exceeding their ceilings. The statement by <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> minister, hinted at early trouble with the agreement. But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlotok </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the statement `` should n't surprise anyone'' because of the country's repeated overproduction in the past He said he expected the agreement `` to largely hold. There's going to be one main cheater -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> -RRB-. `` As long as that is all,'' he said, `` they wo n't fare too badly.'' A critical element of the agreement was the inclusion of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. It refused to join the accord arranged in 1986, because it wanted the same production ceiling as bitter rival <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` We are happy to be back,'' said <PERSON> al-Chalabi </PERSON>. The meeting closed Monday with the approval of the agreement. The next ministerial meeting will be June 5. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.

 Six Iranian clerics and three other men were executed in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> this month after being convicted of corruption, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The executions, the latest in a series of executions announced by the government in the past five months, heightened speculation of a new power struggle within the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> regime. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the men were executed after they made `` explicit admissions'' of guilt. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted Iranian Intelligence Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON> as saying the nine had been `` implicated in various offences.'' `` Several pseudo-clergymen, including <PERSON> Omid </PERSON> <PERSON> Najafabadi </PERSON>, who was arrested some time ago, were condemned to death after being tried, and the executions have been carried out,'' <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Najafabadi </PERSON>, a former deputy in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested in December 1986 in connection with a scandal involving <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON>, the brother of the son-in-law of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, the designated successor of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> was executed last year for treason, terrorism and kidnapping after he exposed Parliamentary Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s clandestine contacts with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the arms-for-hostages deal. His execution brought into sharp focus the infighting between governing factions in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> report confirmed a claim earlier this month by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main opposition group, the Iraqi-based <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION>, that a group of clergymen had been executed on <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s orders Dissident Iranian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed at the time that the victims were linked to <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>. The sources said <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> had `` vehemently protested'' to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> `` the wave of mass executions'' that began in July. The regime has blamed the stabbing death Wednesday of former Health Minister <PERSON> Kazem </PERSON> <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> on the People's Holy Warriors, but the dissidents said Monday that the killing was `` carried out on <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s personal order.'' The Iranian dissident sources say that the recent executions are part of a systematic campaign by <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s faction to eliminate <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>'s supporters. The power struggle centers on efforts by various groups to gain supremacy after the death of the 88-year-old <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who is reported in poor health. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> faces considerable opposition from powerful political figures such as <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. The power struggle appears to have intensified after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s decision to accept a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war _ a move opposed by hardliners in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION> claimed that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acting commander-in-chief is the most powerful figure after the revolutionary patriarch, `` want to make it abundantly clear ... that the consequence of non-conformity or dissent, even within the regime, is death.'' A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report on human rights in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> issued in early November criticized <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for carrying out `` a wave of executions'' of opposition members following the cease-fire in the war. The dissident Iranian factions have said that more than 1,100 activists were executed before the cease-fire took effect Aug. 20. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced Friday it will allow the first visit by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> human rights investigators by the end of December in hopes of refuting the reports of mass executions.

<HEAD>Mayor Calls for a New Look at Decentralization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAYNER PIKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With investigations of abuse going forward in nearly a fifth of the city's local public school districts, Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> asserted Monday that decentralization should be re-evaluated. `` I'm not telling you decentralization is all bad, but it ca n't be all good,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> told reporters at City Hall after a weekend in which allegations of sexual extortion surfaced in the probe of cocaine use and other misconduct in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> `` There's no question in my mind that the local school boards leave a lot to be desired,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. District Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>'s revelation that school board members in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> have been accused of demanding sex from teachers in return for jobs and promotions has made the burgeoning scandal `` more shocking than when the matter first came to public attention,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. In another weekend disclosure, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that the schools' inspector general was investigating District Boards 4 and 5 in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and 16 and 32 in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> as well as Boards 9 and 12 in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, already under investigation by the district attorney. Green has suspended the District 9 board pending results of the investigation, an action the board planned to challenge in court. Schools Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> reiterated Monday in a television interview that `` decentralization is on trial.'' `` These people are elected, they're not appointed,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said on the `` CBS Morning News.'' `` We would expect that if they're going to make decentralization work, we're going to have to agree to a different set of rules than have been operating in some school districts.'' Green, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> planned to go to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> on Tuesday to continue lobbying the Legislature to bar politicians from running for local boards and using them as bases for power and patronage. They also want to return to the chancellor more power over principals of elementary and intermediate schools. Decentralization took effect 18 years ago over the opposition of 50,000 teachers, whose bitter strike divided the city on racial lines. It put control of the 800 schools for kindergarten through eighth or ninth grade in the hands of 32 locally elected district boards. The high schools remained under jurisdiction of the central board. The principle of community control, in numerous instances, yielded to the reality of 5 percent voter turnouts for school elections, which effectively turned the boards over to the politically organized. The current scandal began unfolding in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> early this month when <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON>, principal of P.S. 53 in District 9, was arrested on a charge of buying crack. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> suspended <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON>, but was criticized for failing to follow up politically by going to the district to show concern and using the incident to seek power to get rid of inferior but tenure-entrenched principals. In the days that followed, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> hardened his line, which included reversing his opposition to drug testing. He announced last week that a new policy on testing for teachers and principals suspected of drug use would be taken up by the board Dec. 7. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said over the weekend that at least two members of local school boards in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> have offered to cooperate with his investigators. He did not identify either the members or their boards. Among the main allegations reportedly before the grand jury in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> were that some school board members used cocaine regularly.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> lashed out at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its former ambassador to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, saying he `` did nothing but make political propaganda against the government.'' Ambassador <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> on Saturday after three years as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy without the customary farewell meeting with the president. In a speech Sunday in <PERSON> Vina </PERSON> del Mar, a coastal resort city 120 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said he had snubbed the ambassador. `` I did not shake his hand, I did see him off, I did not say goodbye,'' said <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. During his tenure, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> had angered the government by promoting greater political freedom and meeting with opposition leaders and human rights activists. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' replacement, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, who is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, is expected to arrive in early December. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, speaking to his right-wing supporters, accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of trying to subjugate <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by sowing dissent and by keeping its inhabitants in debt. `` Why did they give millions of dollars to the opposition?'' he said. `` Because they know this government ... does n't accept that they come to enslave us, to subjugate this tiny country of 12,500,000 inhabitants, that they impose an envoy who does nothing but make political propaganda against the government.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year voted to provide $ 1 million to organizations promoting democracy in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, which has been ruled by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> since he led a bloody 1973 military coup. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> contends that foreign financing of the opposition helped to defeat him in an Oct. 5 referendum. The ballot gave Chileans the option to vote `` yes'' if they were in favor of the general remaining in power until 1997, or `` no'' if they opted for a free election whose winner would take office in 1990.

<TEXT>
 American farm export volume hit a six-year peak of 147.5 million metric tons in the year ended Sept. 30, with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> again the biggest customer, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. In dollar terms, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports climbed from $ 27.87 billion in fiscal 1987 to $ 35.2 billion this past year, a gain of 26 percent, while imports of farm products were up 2 percent to a record $ 21 billion, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. That left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with a net agricultural trade surplus of $ 14.2 billion in black ink for fiscal 1988, compared with $ 7.22 billion a year earlier. Export volume rose 14 percent from the 129.2 million metric tons posted in fiscal 1987, with wheat accounting for two-thirds of the increase, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. A metric ton is equivalent to about 2,205 pounds. Wheat exports climbed from 28.2 million metric tons in 1987 to 40.5 million tons in the last fiscal year. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> together purchased a total of 14.6 million tons of that amount, or 36 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat shipments in fiscal 1988. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> together imported 4.95 million metric tons of American wheat, or 18 percent of total shipments, in 1987. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> led all customers, importing 27.8 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural goods. Other leading purchasers were: the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, 25.5 million metric tons; the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 15.9 million metric tons; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, 8 million; and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, 7.3 million. In addition to wheat, considerable tonnage gains were posted by corn, grain sorghum, feeds and fodders and vegetable oils. Among products not measured on the basis of metric tons, the biggest gains were in baby chicks, live animals, fruit juices, wines and malt beverages. The surging gains, however, were moderated a bit by weakened foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans, soybean meal and rice. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said all leading foreign markets grew in fiscal 1988 except that of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, whose imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural goods dropped nearly 1.1 million metric tons. The decrease mainly reflected fewer purchases of soybean and soybean meal. Indeed, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were among the five fastest-growing markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture, joining <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. On the dollar value side, American high-value exports such as livestock and horticultural products climbed to a record $ 16.4 billion in 1988, a gain of $ 2.7 billion or 19 percent over the 1987 level. It also represented a $ 1.1 billion gain over the previous peak, reached in 1981. Exports of bulk commodities shot up 33 percent from 1987 to a total of $ 18.8 billion. The level topped $ 25 billion in 1984 before immense crop surpluses and stiffer foreign competition battered prices and sent <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture into the doldrums. Increased purchases of wheat and corn were the main reason for the increase, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were the leading markets for wheat and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, while the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were tops for corn. Agricultural imports of $ 21 billion were some $ 250 million or 2 percent above the 1987 level and about $ 100 million over the 1986 mark of $ 20.9 billion, the previous record high. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said the increase was not limited to any single commodity group but instead reflected modest increases in nearly all major competitive items. Top suppliers were: the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, $ 4.12 billion; <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, $ 2.37 billion; <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, $ 1.9 billion; <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, $ 1.9 billion and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, $ 1.15 billion. Products reflecting increases were vegetable oil, live cattle, beef and veal, wines and malt beverages and nursery products. There were drops in imports of sugar, pork, fur, coffee and spices.

 A couple in this rural <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> community have stopped paying taxes on 11 acres of land because they do n't know where it is, but that has n't deterred town officials from plans to sell the parcel for back taxes. The land has been taxed since 1970 even though it apparently does not exist. In that year, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Nascimento </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> and a brother, now dead, bought the land, near an old Boy Scout camp, for $ 2,100. They obtained a quit-claim deed on the property, which protects the seller from responsibility if a problem is revealed in the title, because they did not have enough money to spend on a title search and survey, <PERSON> Nascimento </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nascimento </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>, intended the purchase to be an investment. Without ever inspecting the land, they paid a total of $ 2,500 in taxes between 1970 and 1985, when a town official informed Mrs. <PERSON> Nascimento </PERSON> that the lot's status was in question. The couple now are seeking to get their money back. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinchliffe </PERSON>, the town's tax assessor, said the company that drew up the town's first tax maps in 1972 left the <LOCATION> Nascimento </LOCATION> property out because it could n't find it. She said the Nascimentos were informed `` back in the 1970s'' that the deed did not represent specific property, but they paid their taxes anyway. <PERSON> Hinchliffe </PERSON> said taxes must be levied against all deeds registered with the town, even if the deeds stand for nothing. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Czerkiewicz </PERSON>, the town tax collector, said the rules also call for property to be sold if taxes are more than two years delinquent. However, <PERSON> Czerkiewicz </PERSON> admitted, `` I ca n't understand people buying property not knowing where it is.''

 The congress of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> on Monday decided to postpone a decision on whether to ban a player for life and strip him of his grandmaster title for competing in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinteros </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, already banned from competitions for three years following two visits to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, played a six-game exhibition match in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> in September. <PERSON> Silvanus </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebigwe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, chairman of the federation's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also recommended to delegates that <PERSON> Quinteros </PERSON>'s name be erased from all future documents of the 127-member governing body of chess, known by its French acronym, FIDE While the proposal received strong African support, others questioned the severity of the proposed action against the 40-year-old Argentinian and whether a title gained in competition could ever be removed for a political act. `` While I agree we should certainly not send teams to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, we are not talking about teams, we're talking about individuals,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Josephs </PERSON>, a British citizen representing <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are not policeman.

 Conservationists urged adoption Monday of a rule that would reopen <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> waters to limited redfish harvests after a 19-month ban, but commercial fishermen do n't like the proposed season. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and the state Cabinet are scheduled to consider the rule Dec. 6. If approved, recreational anglers could be catching redfish within a month. Commercial harvests would remained banned. Once sought for the famed Cajun-style blackened redfish, the fish was overharvested and in danger of depletion when the state ordered a halt in April 1987 to all redfish harvests from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> waters and sales of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> redfish. Since stocks have rebounded, the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has suggested allowing one redfish catch per person a day during the nine-month season. Eligible fish would be 18 to 27 inches long to protect breeding fish, and no sales of the fish would be permitted. `` We are convinced that this recommended rule is the most equitable way to allow a very limited harvest while insuring the protection and future of this valuable marine resource,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsgren </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sansom </PERSON>, director of the Organized Fishermen of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said the species has recovered more than enough to support commercial harvests, and he accused the conservationists of trying to mislead the public and state officials. He said the proposed daily bag limit could amount to 750,000 redfish caught each year _ up to 50 times the number harvested each year of snook, the next most-abundant game fish. `` It's better for them certainly, but it's not better for us. They're saying they ca n't allow the commercial fisherman to harvest any because there are n't enough,'' said <PERSON> Sansom </PERSON>. `` If that's a very limited harvest, we've just invented some new words.'' <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have banned redfish harvests. Federal waters in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> also are closed to redfish harvests.

 Concerned calls from citizens about a white goose stuck in the ice on a park lake precipitated an elaborate rescue effort likened to the recent whale saga at <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` We had our own version of the Soviet icebreaker'' that eventually freed the Alaskan whales, said police dispatcher <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Burbach </PERSON> of Sunday's episode. The goose was trapped in thin ice 40 feet from shore on the lake adjoining the <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> Historical Museum. The rescue took four hours of effort by three policemen, state Division of Wildlife workers and parks employees. `` Patrolman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said that the wildlife division guy and the South Suburban -LRB- Parks -RRB- guy put a johnboat on the ice, then the two of them _ kind of like the whales _ they had to break it -LRB- the ice -RRB- with shovels and an ax to get it to float'' to the goose, said fire dispatcher <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` It probably cost the city $ 300,'' she added, but said the public outcry would have been intense if the rescue had not been undertaken.

 <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had scarcely finished saying how grateful he was to be asked to continue as White House spokesman in the new administration when a reporter asked him: `` Will you keep avoiding briefings?'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> glanced at his watch. `` A two-minute honeymoon,'' he grinned. `` Amazing.'' The exchange illustrated two things about <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s two-year tenure as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief link with the press: The job has conflict built into it, and <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> is good at deflecting the conflict with humor. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, 46, a cigar-smoking former <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> journalist who has spent most of his career in government, was tapped by President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Monday to be his press secretary. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he chose <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who was his vice presidential press secretary from 1985 to 1987, because `` I think he's the best.'' The spokesman has received high marks from many reporters covering the White House. But there also have been complaints that he is too easygoing and too often skips his daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> briefings for reporters. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was philosophical about the criticism. `` Facing the White House press corps every day is no day at the beach,'' he said. As to how long he would remain, he said, `` I figure you do this job the way you run the quarter mile. You run as long and hard as you can and as fast as you can, and when you drop they bring in someone else.'' He said the offer from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, which came in a telephone call to his office at 8:30 in the morning, came as a surprise. `` I was making plans to leave,'' he said. He said he would call his two children and tell them the news as soon as they got out of school. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, divorced, has a son and daughter. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s selection marks the first time any incoming president has chosen as his permament press secretary the same individual who did the job for his predecessor. President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON>, stayed on briefly after <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination 25 years ago, but President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> soon replaced him with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> grew up on a farm in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>. As a high school student, he planted tulips at the Eisenhower Library in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION> `` There was a huge picture of <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagerty </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s press secretary -RRB-,'' he said in an interview last year. `` Even then I wondered what it would be like'' to have that job. He landed it in February, 1987, after <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> resigned. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> had taken over the duties from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was seriously wounded in an attempt on the president's life in March, 1981. The job pays $ 77,400 a year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had asked <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> to remain as press secretary, the title that normally goes with the position of presidential spokesman. In the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that title had been reserved for <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. Asked if <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> would have a role in the new administration, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` raised the question internally'' and that the vice president and his advisers `` have some ideas of things they would like him to do.'' From 1981 until 1983, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was press spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, he served nine years as a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> after working as a speechwriter for then-Transportation Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Volpe </PERSON> and at the <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He was a deputy White House press secretary from 1983 to 1985, when he joined the vice president's staff. He was a correspondent and editor with a number of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> newspapers before coming to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> made no commitments as to how often <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would meet with reporters, but said, `` I knew him before to be an open person willing to deal with the press and I think he will be again.''

<HEAD>North Wants To Bar Prosecutors From Hearings on Secret Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former presidential aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> on Monday moved to exclude independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> from closed court hearings on secret documents the Iran-Contra prosecutor wants to use as evidence. In a brief filing, defense lawyers asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> for permission to file a motion to bar <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and his associates from attending hearings set to begin Wednesday. Defense lawyers, meanwhile, dismissed as `` mere spin control'' a prosecution allegation that the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide was threatening to reveal government secrets to scuttle charges against him. No reason was given for North's request to exclude prosecutors from the hearings, which will consider defense objections to deleting sensitive references from some 350 prosecution exhibits. But the former presidential aide's lawyers presumably are set to argue that allowing <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and his associates to attend the hearing would give them an unfair preview of the defense's case. The government has granted <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> permission to use the 1,000 pages to 2,000 pages of classified material as evidence against <PERSON> North </PERSON> in a public trial, provided certain sensitive information is deleted. The references include names of countries, foreign officials and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agents operating abroad. North has objected to virtually all the proposed deletions, and <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ordered him to show why the references are important for defending charges he conspired to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. Last summer, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> gave <PERSON> North </PERSON> an opportunity to detail why he needed classified documents at a closed hearing to which the prosecution was not invited. A spokesman for <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office said the independent counsel would oppose <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s request to bar prosecutors from the hearings. North, meanwhile, urged <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to reject <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s request that he be prohibited from using as defense evidence some 40,000 pages of classified documents. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> North </PERSON> listed many of the documents in his Nov. 14 notice simply to `` provoke a dismissal'' of the charges against him by threatening to disclose some of the nation's best-kept secrets But <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> should reject <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s assertion `` that we have somehow threatened national security or engaged in ` graymail' by taking the first step, required by statute, to protect this nation's secrets.'' The lawyers urged rejection of what it called <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s `` frontal assault on defendant <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s fundamental Fifth and Sixth Amendment right to present a defense.'' `` Under the -LRB- independent counsel's -RRB- perverse regime, the trial would not be a search for truth; witnesses could not tell what they knew about the facts; critical documents would never be presented to the jury; and the verdict would rest upon a distorted sliver of information selected almost entirely by the prosecution.'' No date has been set for North's trial, the first of four ordered by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> for the conspiracy charges against the former presidential aide, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj.

 Nearly 440 Americans died on the nation's highways over the long holiday weekend as millions took to the roads to visit family and friends in celebration of Thanksgiving. The number of highway fatalities this year was 438, down from last year's total of 494 during the four-day Thanksgiving period, which for counting purposes extended from 6 p.m. local time Wednesday to midnight local time Sunday. The highest toll for the holiday was recorded in 1968, when 764 people were killed.

<HEAD>Manet Painting Valued at Over $1 Million Stolen from Museum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A painting by <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Manet </PERSON> worth more than $ 1 million was stolen from the wall of a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> museum, probably as patrons in the same room watched a videotape, police said Monday. The theft at the Heckscher Museum occurred between 3:30 p.m. and 4:40 p.m. Sunday, with the museum open, lights on and guards patrolling. The Impressionist painting, `` Bouquet of Peonies,'' completed in 1880 by <PERSON> Manet </PERSON>, is a still life of red and pink flowers in a glass vase. The painting's owner, who had lent it to the museum, wishes to remain anonymous, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, chairman of the museum's board of trustees. `` She is sunk by the whole thing,'' he said. International art dealers, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the international police agency <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> have been contacted to help retrieve the oil painting, according to Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police. A visitor said he had seen the painting at about 3:30 p.m., then turned around to view a 15-minute videotape on an <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wyeth </LOCATION> exhibit being shown in the same room. When he returned to look at the painting at about 4:40 p.m., it was gone. <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> said the painting probably was taken during a showing of the videotape. The thief apparently took the painting from the wall, walked about 35 feet to the front door and got away, said <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON>. He said the painting, in its gold antiqued frame, measures about 16 -LCB- by 21 -LCB- inches and could easily have been concealed under someone's coat. Two uniformed security guards were patrolling the five display rooms, <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> said. Museum officials said alarm systems were in place and working, although they would give no information about the alarms. But Detective <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Barreiro </PERSON>, one of the first investigators on the scene, said there apparently was no alarm system on. A companion painting, <PERSON> Manet </PERSON>'s `` Roses, Tulips and Lilacs in a Crystal Vase,'' on loan from the same owner, was hanging to the right of the stolen piece. It was immediately taken down by museum personnel and placed in a storage vault. `` At first she -LRB- the owner -RRB- wanted it back, but I think now she is content that we have it in a safe place,'' said <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>. About 200 people, some from out of state, visited the museum Sunday, and about 26 visitors were in the museum when the theft was discovered. Many of the visitors who signed a guest book on Sunday were being interviewed by police. `` At this point we have no suspects,'' said <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON>. The exact value of the work was not disclosed over concern of possible ransom by the thieves or help in marketing the work. <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> both said it was worth more than $ 1 million. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the town of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, which owns the museum, said town officials will be meeting with its insurance company to discuss a settlement on the stolen property. It was the first theft of artwork from the museum, which was built in 1920, <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON> said.

And I really did n't have any moniker attached to me for a long time, except for being short and funny-looking.'' As for Cruise, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> says, `` He's a demon. He gets up early, he works out, he goes home early, he studies, he works out again at night. ... And he always wanted to rehearse.'' Cruise, who starred with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> in `` The Color of Money,'' said he learned from his experience. `` What you get from great actors like <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> is where to focus your energies and what to worry about and what not to worry about,'' <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> said. `` Because as a young actor, you're worried about everything.''

 <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief has defied <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by saying his republic `` will not retreat'' just because the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> objects to its declaration of sovereignty. A spokesman said party leader <PERSON> Vaijno </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> declared on Estonian television Sunday night that the rejection of the republic's declaration `` does n't mean we'll accept the decrees of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Vyalyas' statements intensified the constitutional crisis as the federal parliament prepared to revise the charter. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s legislature voted almost unanimously Nov. 16 to declare the tiny <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION> independent of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in all but defense and foreign affairs. It said new laws passed by the national parliament would not apply in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> unless the legislature approved them. <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, quoted <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> as saying in the televised speech Sunday night: `` We will not retreat.'' <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> was reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. The party leader's remarks were broadcast shortly after a report on national television of the meeting of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet at which <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s declaration of sovereignty was declared unconstitutional. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, chairman of the Presidium, said in his speech to the parliamentary executive body: `` If we took this road to division, it would slow down development and result in huge losses. It runs counter to the entire course of perestroika, economic reform and democratization of public life.'' Perestroika is <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s name for his program of economic and social reform. Four related amendments to the Estonian constitution also were rejected by the Presidium, according to a report Monday in the party newspaper Pravda. The amendments give <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> power to veto Soviet laws; claim the republic's land, natural resources and industry as the property of the republic; give citizens the right to challenge governmental actions in court, and legalize private property. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was particularly offended by the last item. `` Private property is the basis of exploitation of man by man,'' he said. `` It is a deeply erroneous decision.'' <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON>, who had been considered a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ally, said on Estonian television he and other leaders in the republic had `` fully expected'' a negative reaction from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> reported, `` but that does n't mean we'll accept the decrees of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' `` Only the Estonian parliament can change the decisions of the Estonian parliament,'' the spokesman said. `` We have rights and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has rights, too.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 300-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the 1,500-member Supreme Soviet are meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s constitutional changes, which <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and some of the 14 other republics say shifts too much power to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> On Sunday, the populist <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said the Presidium attempt to cancel the Estonian amendments violated the Estonian constitution, journalist <PERSON> Tarmu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tammerk </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Kodumaa </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` It violates the republic's right to self-determination,'' a guarantee currently enshrined in the Soviet constitution, <PERSON> Tammerk </PERSON> explained. That section is among those up for revision at Tuesday's meeting of the national parliament Although <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has favored ending central economic control and encouraged greater local responsibility, he denounced the Estonian notion that the republic rather than <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> should control land and factories. `` It would preclude the possibility of conducting a single socio-economic policy, making it impossible to distribute production forces rationally and to create single transport systems and power grids,'' he said. He expressed shock at the notion of dividing railways and turning over huge metallurgical operations, but did hold out the possibility of local control in such light industry as food supply, local transport and trade, medical care, schools and restaurants. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also left the door open to future negotiations with the <LOCATION> Estonian </LOCATION> leadership about the problems that prompted the challenge, declaring to the Presidium: `` We ought to see the legitimacy of the real questions which <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> has come to face and which demand solution,'' he said. Kremlin leaders `` share the indigation'' of Estonians about the `` cavalier use of nature'' by certain <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> ministries, he said. Pollution by factories controlled from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was one of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s complaints

 Some of <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' third-grade classmates wept when they learned that she had been killed in Monday's tornado, while others asked questions no one could answer. `` They asked why _ why it had to happen to <PERSON> Janet </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, a teaching assistant. `` One girl said, ` She's our leader.''' Pupils and teachers at <ORGANIZATION> Lynn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> reacted with grief at the death of the brown-haired, 8-year-old girl who, by all accounts, was bright, outgoing and everybody's friend. She was one of two children who died when tornadoes hit <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> early Monday. The other was <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulghum </PERSON>, 12, who lived about two mies from <PERSON> Janet </PERSON>. Two other people, a married couple, died in nearby <LOCATION> Nash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Outside <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>'s demolished house, neighbors remembered how they helped the boy's mother, <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulghum </PERSON>, look in vain for him after the storm went through. `` This is kind of a quiet neighborhood; the people are n't real close,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, who lives across the street. `` We do n't socialize much, but we were all helping each other out then. People dug with axes and crowbars while others combed nearby yards with flashlights. More than an hour later, a man found <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>'s body `` He pulled out his hands and there was blood on them,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. `` He was crying. They had a fireman take a look at -LRB- Pete -RRB-, but he was gone.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fulghum </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>'s 15-year-old sister, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, were treated for lacerations and released. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Earp </PERSON>, principal at <PERSON> Janet </PERSON>'s school, said the girl was sleeping in an upstairs room when the tornado hit, collapsing a brick chimney on top of her and killing her instantly. Her parents and an older sister escaped serious injury. `` We all feel so empty,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON>'s teacher, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` If all students could be like her, teaching would be so different.'' <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> impressed her teachers by being the only third-grader to run for a <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> office at <ORGANIZATION> Lynn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> this year. With the other candidates, she had to give a short speech on the school's closed-circuit television system She lost to a fourth-grader but handled it well, Ms. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said. `` She was a go-getter. ... She will be terribly, terribly missed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The students are dealing with the trauma well, but will need help as the shock wears off, Ms. <PERSON> Earp </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> described <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> as `` a typical kid'' who liked to go fishing and set off firecrackers. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said he owns two <LOCATION> Labrador </LOCATION> retrievers and that <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> would often come over to play with them. `` The last time I saw him was maybe a week ago,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. `` He and his mom had been to a movie. He had seen a black dog running loose and he thought it was one of mine. It was n't, but he wanted to let me know. `` He was a good kid.''

 Two men were arrested for allegedly sending extortion letters to hundreds of residents north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, threatening the recipients with death unless they paid money, authorities said Monday. <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Makuch </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Faroni </PERSON>, 26, who moved from the <LOCATION> Antelope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> after the threatening letters were sent, were arrested in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, said Deputy <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Department. The men were arrested during the Thanksgiving weekend and were booked for investigation of felony extortion, said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Detectives from the sheriff's department served several search warrants in the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> area during the weekend, but <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he had no details. At least 265 residents of the <LOCATION> Antelope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a desert area 60 miles north of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, began receiving the computer-generated letters Nov. 1. The letters, including personal information on the recipients, demanded amounts ranging from several hundred dollars to $ 600,000. The scheme generally targeted prominent citizens such as doctors, dentists and lawyers. Authorities were besieged by telephone calls from recipients in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> communities of <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Quartz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Antelope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> newspaper offered a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the letters' author City Editor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grooms </PERSON> called the threats `` an assault on the entire community.'' `` They're all worded the same. The threat is all the same,'' said sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, who refused to discuss details of the threats. But Lancaster Mayor <PERSON> Els </PERSON> <PERSON> Groves </PERSON> said some of them included references to `` cutting hearts out.'' Investigators did n't believe anyone complied with demands that money be delivered to various locations or to people named in the letters, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. They also did n't believe any attempt was made to carry out the threats. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the two men had lived in <LOCATION> Antelope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> for three years and moved to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> after the letters were mailed. The letters bore a Mojave postmark. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said detectives will present evidence to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office, which will file criminal complaints.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON>, the American actor known of his roles in horror films, whispered `` <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, what a beautiful place to die'' moments before succumbing to heart and kidney failure, a son said Monday. The 82-year-old actor with a Mephistophelean face and a deep voice died Sunday at a <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> hospital. He had been hospitalized since Thursday. Actor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON> said his father was stricken Thursday, hours after climbing the 328 steps to the top of the Duomo, <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>'s gothic cathedral `` He had climbed a steep flight of stairs to reach the top of the Duomo. He was determined to do everything he could. He had a strong constitution but he had possibly caught a virus in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> which had weakened him,'' <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON>, in tears, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> and his brother, fellow actor <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON>, flew to <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Sunday after learning their father had been hospitalized. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON> said his father already was in serious condition when they arrived, but that he was happy to have been with him during the last hours of his life. Doctors at <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s Fatebenefratelli hospital said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON>, who appeared in more than 500 films, died of natural causes. `` His kidneys, his lungs, his heart were failing. If he was younger he could have survived,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON>. `` The failure of three organs all at once was a little much.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON> had traveled to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to begin a European tour after completing shooting of his latest movie _ his 502nd _ in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` He was thinking of visiting <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. ... He could have sat on his rocking chair but he chose instead to embarak on an adventure. He knew the dangers and nobody could tell him sit down and be quiet,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON> said he was reading his father passages from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, `` the author he loved most,'' when the sick man `` swallowed, turned his head a little while and died.'' Just minutes before the actor had said: `` <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, what a beautiful place to die,'' according to his son. A family friend said the body possibly would be flown to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, via <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, on Wednesday. `` We plan a strictly private funeral service in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> and a public memorial service in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Episcopal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> ... then we will drink, cry and dance and his ashes will be cast into the sea. All his sons will be there,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON>. He said the date of the funeral has not been set. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON>, best known for playing a half-Chinese priest in the television show `` <LOCATION> Kung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fu </LOCATION>,'' is one of the acting sons of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON>. The others are <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> Monday night, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>. Only <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON>, an architect, is not an actor. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON> appeared in such classics as `` Stagecoach'' with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> and `` Grapes of Wrath'' with <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>. He also played leads in numerous B-movies, often horror films, and portrayed Count Dracula three times on the screen. His film debut came in 1930 with the talkie remake of `` Tol ` able <PERSON> David </PERSON> By 1935 his glorious, deep voice attracted the attention of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and other directors making him one of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s busiest character actors. `` I never made big money in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>; I was paid in hundreds, the stars got thousands,'' he said in a 1986 interview. `` But I worked with some of the greatest directors in film, and some of the greatest writers. They gave me freedom to do what I can do best and that was gratifying.'' He always returned to <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, touring the country with his own company.

<TEXT>
 A former fund-raiser for <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> testified Monday it became `` increasingly clear'' that the <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> movement did n't plan to repay loans made to its organizations, but acknowledged he had been far less critical in previous court testimony. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> testified at <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s conspiracy trial that the three-time presidential candidate's political movement raised money under false pretenses and did not tell those lending it money that their loans were not likely to be repaid. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said he left the LaRouche organization in May 1986 after `` it became increasingly clear to me there was a policy they were not going to repay'' the loans. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six associates are on trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on charges they conspired to defraud the lenders with a scheme to avoid repayment of their loans. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> alone is charged with conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> by failing to pay taxes and not declaring as income household and personal services provided by LaRouche-run organizations. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> told the jury that he and other LaRouche fund-raisers were instructed to tell those who complained about non-repayment of loans, `` We're in the midst of a war fighting for the human race. In war there are casualties.'' Another prosecution witness, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, testified she loaned a LaRouche organization $ 20,000 and received only $ 500 in interest as a repayment. Ms. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> fundraiser <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON> had promised her the loan would be repaid in a year at 10 percent interest. <PERSON> Billington </PERSON> told her, she testified, that her money was `` as safe as in the bank.'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> also said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> organizers concocted a fund-raising scheme in which potential givers were falsely told their money was needed to publish a LaRouche anti-drug book because Latin American leaders urged that the publication be rushed into print. But under cross-examination, defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON> showed <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> statements he had made to federal and state law enforcement officers and in testimony at a LaRouche trial in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> earlier this year. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> was forced to acknowledge repeatedly his earlier statements that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> operatives acted in `` good faith'' to repay the loans but were unable to do so because the movement was engaged in `` financial warfare.'' The latter statement backs the contention of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and his co-defendants that they intended to repay some $ 30 milliion in loans but were unable to do so when they had to divert money to defend themselves against harassment by the government and news media. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> also acknowledged to jurors that he testified in the earlier trial that he did not believe the non-repayment was the result of a scam but stemmed from the `` irresponsibility and negligence'' of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> staffers. `` You swore to tell the truth'' at the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> trial, <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON> asked. `` I did,'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said. Under friendlier questioning from Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said chief <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> fund-raiser <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>, a defendant in the case, established quotas for his subordinates. When quotas were not met, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON> accused the staffers of being `` impotent,'' with `` lacking killer instinct'' and being `` not sufficiently ruthless.'' Asked by <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> to describe the reaction of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> staffers to such tirades, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said: `` I saw a number of people break down and cry. Some became hysterical over the telephone and started shouting at contacts, calling them names. I saw organizers become visibly distraught and become depressed.'' <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. The mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters of credit sent through the mails by the LaRouche organization. Conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines of $ 3.25 million for LaRouche. The six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mail fraud and conspiracy charges. In the tax conspiracy count, the federal grand jury charged that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> has not filed a federal income tax return since at least 1979.

<TEXT>
 The ruling <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> re-elected President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> as party chief Monday night and a chose a new <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to help him achieve political reform. As secretary-general of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s only party, <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> becomes the sole candidate in a presidential election the party congress set for Dec. 22. The election, in which he seeks his third five-year term, originally was to have been held in February. The new 155-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s membership is roughly one-third each from local chapters; government and party officials, and associations and professional groups. Party professionals and the army dominated the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I need your help because the mission is difficult, the task is long and the problems are great,'' Bendjedid, 59, told the 5,078 delegates as the sixth party congress ended. `` The renewal of your confidence is a support for the political reform proposals, of which a part have already been applied and others are going to be. I promise to do my best to implement your political program.'' Bendjedid's opening speech Sunday at the two-day congress was less forceful than expected. Sources at the meeting said privately he appeared to want a compromise with those in the army and party apparatus who opposed his reform plans. Part of that compromise apparently involved postponing a multiparty system in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. For two years, <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> has been trying to loosen the grip of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> on day-to-day government operations. The front, originally the military organization that won <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1962, later became the sole legal political party Momentum for change was increased by a week of riots in October in which 176 were killed by official count and hundreds wounded. There were numerous reports of torture by police. The first series of reforms, mostly changes to the constitution, were approved in a nationwide referendum Nov. 3. Among the changes were wider powers accorded the premier and making the premier directly responsible to parliament instead of the president. In his opening speech, <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> said a a multiparty state could come at at a later date if all agreed on the need for it. A multiparty system now, he said, represented a threat to the unity of the nation. The foreign press has been barred from directly covering the congress and denied access to the conference hall, although Algerian news organizations are covering the event. <PERSON> Abdelhamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehri </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the party, said at a news conference the subject of introducing a multiparty system was not raised before the 5,078 delegates to the congress. Instead, <ORGANIZATION> Bendjedid </ORGANIZATION> has focused on bringing new blood into the existing party, noting that many `` honest and patriotic'' people have not joined, <PERSON> Mehri </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> is not going to withdraw from political life,'' <PERSON> Mehri </PERSON> said. `` It will continue as a political force that will be active at all levels.'' He said the first step was to open a wider dialogue involving as many people and groups as possible. `` For now, we ca n't talk about parties or associations because now they do n't exist,'' he said. He said that under the reforms to be proposed to parliament, independent candidacies outside the party framework would be allowed in elections for local and national assemblies.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc asked Labor on Monday to join a new coalition government, offering the rival party two of the four most powerful Cabinet posts. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> met with the center-left party's leaders, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. It was the first meeting since the Nov. 1 election between <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who have been in a tenuous `` national unity'' coalition since indecisive 1984 elections. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 of the 120 parliament seats Nov. 1 and Labor got 39. The rest went to small parties, 18 of them to ultra-Orthodox religious parties that could be kingmakers in a right-wing coalition. Neither <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> nor Labor ministers would reveal details of the Monday's discussion. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said Labor would respond to the offer later this week. `` We decided to bring the proposals, without any recommendation _ there is no need _ to the -LRB- party -RRB- bureau ... the body authorized to decide, based on the offers we got, whether to go to negotiations or not,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said after briefing Labor ministers. The government under discussion would be similar to the 4-year-old coalition, but <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would be prime minister all four years rather than switching jobs with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> at mid-tern, as happened in 1986. Labor broke off coalition talks with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> last week, calling its offer of one senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post insufficient. The prime ministry, foreign, defense and finance are considered senior posts. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> subsequently offered <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said, despite his opposition to his rival's proposal for an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference and differences on terms of peace with the Arabs. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> already agreed to offer Labor the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, so Labor would have two senior posts and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would control the prime minister's office and the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The radio said that <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, overall, insists on having <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> ministers outnumber Labor ministers by at least one on the full Cabinet. The latest offer from <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> comes after <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s efforts to construct a coalition with small religious and right-wing parties stalled, following squabbles over Cabinet posts and demands for religious legislation that has split Jews worldwide. The religious parties were demanding a new immigration law that would deny immediate Israeli citizenship to Jews converted by Reform or Conservative rabbis, reserving citizenship only for Orthodox converts. The <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> ministers made no decision in Monday's meeting about what foreign policy a Likud-Labor government might formulate. The issue is likely to be a major stumbling block in negotiations. Israeli news reports said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would insist that <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> be barred from openly advocating an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. In the election campaign, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> called for trading land for peace and launching negotiations under the umbrella of an international conference. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rejected territorial compromise and called for direct talks aimed at granting the Palestinians limited autonomy.

Fourteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. In addition <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, 32, a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, was abducted by three unidentified gunmen Nov. 17 in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. No group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> is scheduled to meet with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> on Tuesday and is expected to raise the hostages issue again. The West German is also to hold talks Tuesday with Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. `` The issue of the hostages remains of the utmost concern to us,'' said the West German source. `` We are ready to do whatever we can to speed their release.'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> discussed `` mutual political, economic and cultural ties as well as international cooperation and regional issues,'' according to the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> that Bonn-Tehran relations were `` consolidating daily ... on a basis of mutual respect,'' the report said. The agency made no mention of the hostage issue. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which has strong trade links with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, could play a major role in the reconstruction following the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war, the agency reported. A cease-fire went into effect Aug. 20. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> imports more goods from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> than from any other country, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Bonn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> was accompanied by a 30-member delegation, including West German industrial leaders. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s diplomacy and his good contacts with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> throughout the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war were seen as key factors in the release of two West German hostages who had been held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In his meeting with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> also `` stressed -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s concern -RRB- over the human rights situation in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' said the West German source. He was referring to reports by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights organization, of human rights violations in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the source said.

 A federal judge ordered the extradition to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of former Nazi SS Capt. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON>, who is accused of killing at least 5,000 people, most of them Jews, at forced labor camps. <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON>'s lawyers said they would appeal Monday's ruling on grounds his responsibility was limited because he was obeying orders from superiors. <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON>, 76, commanded labor camps in occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during World War II. He was arrested Nov. 13, 1987, in <LOCATION> Huerta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, a village 500 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, and has been jailed since in this city 31 miles south of the capital. At a deportation hearing in July, three survivors of the <LOCATION> Przemysl </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mielec </LOCATION> labor camps testified that <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> personally shot Jews, starved prisoners and set dogs on them. `` He was a sadist, an evil person,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Blonder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> testified. At the time of his arrest, <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> was among the most-wanted <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> on a list compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` We believe that the judge ruled correctly. We think the chances of winning an appeal are remote,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hier </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holocaust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> requested <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON>'s extradition. Acourt in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> issued an order for his arrest in 1973. `` We already have been asked by the government of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to find witnesses for his trial there,'' <PERSON> Hier </PERSON> said. `` It's usually difficult to find witnesses so many years after the crime. To have so many witnesses that personally saw him commit the crime of murder is an indication of the magnitude of his crimes.'' Many top <PERSON> Nazis </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> when it became clear that <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s defeat was in inevitable. <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, architect of the `` final solution'' in which Jews were rounded up and executed, was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> in 1960 by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents, convicted at a trial in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and hanged. Argentine police currently have been asked to find <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Kipp </PERSON>, a former citizen of <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> sentenced to death for crimes committed during World War II. Last month, A Dutch parliamentarian urged the arrest and extradition of <PERSON> Kipp </PERSON>, who in 1949 was convicted for his part in the arrests of dozens of Dutch Jews by German police during the Nazi occupation in 1940-1945. <PERSON> Kipp </PERSON> became a naturalized Argentine in 1953. <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1949 and obtained citizenship in 1965. <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION> and worked for a chemical company for many years, officials said.

<HEAD>Trade Battle Looms over Hormones in Meat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> have decided against having talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week to explore prospects for averting a trade battle over the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s scheduled Jan. 1 ban of meat from animals treated with growth hormones. `` They just saw the Americans the weekend before last and they'll see them again in another week,'' said <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Krucoff </PERSON>, speaking for the community's delegation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers stand to lose meat sales which totaled about $ 169 million last year in the 12 EEC nations, and administration officials say President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could retaliate with restrictions against the sale of European meat products, or even some industrial products, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolfa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the value of the European meat exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is higher, because they include high quality items like Danish ham. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, on the other hand, includes a large quantity of cheaper cuts such as hearts and kidneys, she said. The use of hormones to speed animal growth is forbidden in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s member nations, which include <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. However, there have been widespread reports of illegal use of hormones by European producers and Ms. <PERSON> Stolfa </PERSON> suggested it could be appropriate to delay the import ban while the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> completes an investigation already in progress. Earlier Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said imminent talks were possible in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> would be represented by <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, a Belgian in charge of external affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Netherlander </LOCATION> and top agricultural official. But they apparently decided to wait for a meeting in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, beginning Dec. 5, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> are due to review trade issues with representatives of nearly 100 nations. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the hormones used on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cattle do not leave residues that are harmful to humans. He said scientists in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have supported the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has proposed that international decisions on the safety of hormones be entrusted to the <ORGANIZATION> Codex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alimentarius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> body with 129 governments as members.

 A Soyuz TM-7 spacecraft carrying a joint Soviet-French team docked Monday with the Mir orbiting space station, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The capsule, which will remained docked almost a month, was manned by Soviet cosmonauts <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON> and Frenchman <PERSON> Jean-Loup </PERSON> <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Soyuz capsule was fitted with a new guidance system that simplified rendezvous and docking and cut down on fuel consumption. It said the three men entered Mir after checking air locks and that they and the three cosmonauts already aboard Mir all were feeling well. <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON> blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> on Saturday, with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on hand to watch. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Soyuz's engines were fired in the 32nd and 33rd orbit Monday, bringing it 25 miles closer to the space station, and then an automatic guidance system brought the capsule to within 400 yards of the space station. At that point, the Soyuz started circling until it reached a distance of 150 yards, and mission control gave the order for its crew to move in and dock. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Soyuz is attached to the Kvant orbiting laboratory, which docked with the space station last March. <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON> is to return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Dec. 21 with cosmonauts <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON>, who will be completing a full year in orbit. Earlier this month they broke the space endurance record set by cosmonaut <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanenko </PERSON> in 1987. <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON> will replace <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Titov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON> is to make a space walk to install some equipment and conduct tests during his month in space.

<HEAD>Scientist Says Space Flight Reduces Growth Hormone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID S. MARTIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> scientist who tested rats flown aboard an unmanned Soviet spacecraft said Monday he found lower levels of a hormone affecting the rodents' bone and muscle mass. <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hymer </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NASA-funded </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, said learning why growth hormone levels were reduced in the rats could have implications on lengthy space missions and osteoporosis research. Astronauts have experienced bone and muscle losses during space flight, a possible hindrance to lengthy missions such as a manned space station or journey to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. `` One could think about using space as a research laboratory for studying osteoporosis,'' said <PERSON> Hymer </PERSON>, a 53-year-old biochemistry professor at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who has worked with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> since 1978. `` The changes that one sees in space with regard to loss of bone mass and mineral density not only parallel and mimic what you find here on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, but they happen quicker,'' he said. Some 24 million Americans, most of them elderly, suffer from osteoporosis, a loss of bone tissue that results in brittle bones, according to the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Osteoporosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hymer </PERSON>'s tests on cells from five rats aboard a 12 -LCB- - day flight on the Soviet Cosmos Biosatellite flight last October duplicated results of an earlier experiment he conducted on 24 rats aboard a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle mission in 1985 Both experiments showed the release of growth hormone reduced by about half in rats who were in weightless conditions. `` The next step is to find out why,'' <PERSON> Hymer </PERSON> said. Next summer, <PERSON> Hymer </PERSON> plans to test cells of five more rats flown aboard a Soviet biosatellite to see how they respond to a chemical from the brain that causes growth hormone to be released from the pituitary gland. <PERSON> Hymer </PERSON> also has received permission to conduct further research about a future shuttle mission. In that experiment, expected to find a space shuttle berth sometime in the next two years, <PERSON> Hymer </PERSON> plans to send growth hormone producing cells from the pituitary gland into space to see how they respond to weightlessness. <PERSON> Hymer </PERSON>'s research was one of 27 American projects aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> flight last year. He collaborated with three Soviet researchers, who were to release the findings this week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Man has been in space for over 30 years. We know that there are changes that occur. We certainly do n't know about the mechanisms that are involved,'' said <PERSON> Hymer </PERSON>. `` We need desperately to do more research in the space environment,'' he added. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said that in the absence of American missions, the availability of <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> flights has kept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> life sciences research going in space. Americans have been able to conduct experiments aboard six Soviet biosatellite missions under an agreement first signed during the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has not had room for any life sciences research since the <ORGANIZATION> Challenger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spacelab </ORGANIZATION> 3 in 1985. A Space Life Sciences mission is scheduled for 1991, <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> also has planned to launch biannual Lifesat flights similar to the Cosmos missions beginning in late 1990 or 1991, <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> said. Soviet scientists would be invited to participate in research conducted aboard those flights, he said.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will have to request a 2 percent real increase in defense spending next year unless it wants to reduce military strength overseas and cut aircraft carrier deployments, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Monday. `` At 2 percent real growth, our current defense budget is executeable,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said in response to a question after delivering a speech marking <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 40th birthday. `` Now, obviously, if you go from 2 percent real growth to zero real growth -LRB- just matching inflation -RRB-, you've got a problem, and over a five-year period, that problem is about $ 116 billion in programs,'' he continued. `` I think our force structure is about as low as you can sensibly get it and still execute our military strategy around the world. If additional force structure cuts are required, you're going to have to look at such things as deployable carrier battle groups and some force structure overseas.'' The only alternative to cuts in strength would be `` the unfortunate way that we did it in the 1970s, which is in effect to hollow out our forces _ shortchange them in ammunition, readiness, let the quality of our people erode _ and I hope we would avoid that.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> spoke at a conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION>, lauding the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s success over the past 40 years in maintaining the peace and offering his prescription for the future. As he has done previously, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the alliance had to maintain `` a firm sense of realism'' about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s intentions, judging <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s actions and not the promises of glasnost He also said all the members of the alliance needed to increase their monetary and political support for defense and continue to modernize their weapons systems. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government should not ask for greater European spending with an eye toward reducing its own contributions to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, `` but as a way of nurturing defense cooperation,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who has made it clear he expects to step down from his post when Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, said he was proceeding with plans to submit a fiscal 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget request in January that would include money to increase spending by 2 percent after inflation. The fiscal 1989 budget totals about $ 300 billion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be free to accept or modify the fiscal 1990 proposal before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> considers it. `` My position is that we ought to continue to argue for the 2 percent real increase,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` Domestic programs continue to rise at a rate of about 8 percent. I see nothing wrong with 2 percent real growth in our defense budget, particularly coming on the heels of a 12 percent total cut over the past four years.'' At the same conference, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, named by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be the national security adviser in the next administration, said there are `` a lot of problems'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations face in the future. The two sides will have to work out ways to share the burden of defense and keep their `` collective wits'' about them in regard to the Soviets, he said.

 Two officers wearing bulletproof vests were disarmed and fatally shot in the head Monday as they struggled with a man released from prison 10 days ago, police said. The man, who had served eight years in prison for attempted murder, fled in one of the officers' patrol cars and stole another car at gunpoint before he was arrested in neighboring <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, police said. One <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police officer died at a hospital shortly after the early-morning shooting; the second was pronounced dead about noon. `` Both of the officers had head wounds, very serious head wounds, as well as to the arms and shoulders and about the tops of their bodies,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. The officers, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boles </PERSON>, 41, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strzalkowski </PERSON>, 34, were shot a total of seven times, apparently with their own weapons, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. Two counts of first-degree murder were expected to be filed against <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Boynton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, said Metro-Dade Sgt. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>. Police said Street had called an ambulance after reportedly suffering stomach pains. He then declined to go to the hospital, and emergency medical technicians and police left the scene. About an hour later, <PERSON> Boles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strzalkowski </PERSON> were dispatched when Street was spotted throwing rocks at homes in a nearby trailer park and at passing cars. He eventually picked up what appeared to be a pipe and residents chased him out of the trailer park, police said. `` We think they were charged by someone with a pipe, and then he got rid of the pipe and they had to fight by hand, and that's when they lost the guns,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. After the shooting, police charged, Street sped away in a patrol car, abandoned it in the neighboring <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and stole a car there from a woman at gunpoint. <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> deputies were alerted by radio, and two officers on patrol saw the man in the street about an hour later, said <PERSON> Broward </PERSON> sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON>. `` They approached to try to find out what was going on, and at that point the suspect dropped the gun and said to the deputy, ` Do n't shoot me,''' <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON> said. Street was taken to jail and later transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police custody. Street had served eight years of a 15-year sentence for an attempted murder in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, who did not have additional details of the conviction. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> also said Street has a police record over 20 pages long dating from 1972, including assaults and other violent crimes.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> lawyer said Monday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no legal basis for denying a visa to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who sought to come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to address the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Carl-August </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was relying on a paragraph <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> added to the 1947 Headquarters Agreement, in which <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> agreed to be the host country for the world body. Section 11 of the agreement says local, state and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities must not impede the travel of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats or `` representatives of non-governmental organizations recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> Unied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for the purpose of consultation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has non-voting observer status at the world body and represents the interests of Palestinians in all debate on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` The Headquarters Agreement makes it clear that there is an unrestricted right of the persons mentioned in Section 11 to enter the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> for the purpose of proceeding to the headquarters,'' <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON> said. On Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the agreement obligates the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to provide entry, transit and residence to guests of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. It relied on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' additional paragraph in denying a visa to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said `` knows of, condones and lends support to'' acts of terrorism it claimed were perpetrated by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> added the paragraph in 1947 upon <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ratification, after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> signed the treaty in 1946. The clause in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, however, seems aimed at restricting the movements of aliens regarded as security risks and does not appear to apply to a brief visit by an invited guest of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. It specifically exempts <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION>, the immediate neighborhood and travel to and from the headquarters from interference by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities on the basis of national security. The key wording of the clause, which is in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law but not in the Headquarters Agreement, reads: `` Nothing in the agreement shall be construed as in any way diminishing, abridging, or weakening the right of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to safeguard its own security and completely to control the entrance of aliens into any territory of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> other than the headquarters district and its immediate vicinity ... and such areas as it is reasonably necessary to traverse in transit between the same and foreign countries.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, on Saturday, merely cited its interest under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law in barring aliens invited by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> `` in order to safeguard its own security.'' It did not quote the passages that specifically exempt brief visits by leaders such as <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Particia </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, the third-ranking ambassador at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> disagreed with <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON>'s assessment but offered no evidence to support the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> position.

 <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> hopes the wheeling and dealing on Wall Street will lure her 11-year-old son away from the deadlier dealing on crack street. He was one of 31 children ages 10 to 15 who attended a one-day class Saturday, learning about the financial rise of the fictitious <ORGANIZATION> Puppy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and hearing about the stock market, bonds and financial journals. The Dollars & amp; Sense program _ in the group's logo, the ampersand resembles a cents sign _ was brought here as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Riviera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s drug abuse resistance education, or DARE, program. The police department in this predominantly low-income city thinks it's a small step toward snagging kids away from the attraction of making easy money _ or spending hard-earned money _ on crack and marijuana. `` They're going to realize that there are other ways to make money beside drugs,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, a deputy clerk for the city. On his way to school, she said, her son can watch drug dealers flashing wads of money and driving fancy cars. But this Saturday, he saw something else. Until now, the 3-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Dollars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sense program has been aimed at wealthier families and was held mainly at resorts and hotels. Saturday's class, however, came to the low - and middle-income students of predominantly black <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> `` This was a chance to see what the rich children see, and learn what the rich children learn,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` I pray to God it works.'' <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 13, said she wants to go to college and become a defense attorney. After learning a little bit of money management, she said what money she receives for Christmas is going into a savings account for college. `` I learned most of all that money does n't grow on trees,'' <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> said. `` I know I'm going to spend my money more carefully.'' And that's just the attitude <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> juvenile officer <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vereen-Thomas </PERSON> hopes the kids took home from their seven-hour lesson. `` We want to get the children to invest in their future,'' she said. `` Come Christmastime, their parents are really going to be shocked.''

 Spanish surrealist painter <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> was hospitalized in extremely critical condition Monday with heart and lung problems, doctors said. The 84-year-old artist was suffering from a weakened heart aggravated by blood clots in his lungs, said a statement issued by a five-doctor team at the <ORGANIZATION> Quiron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> became ill on Sunday and was taken to a hospital in his hometown of <PERSON> Figueras </PERSON>, 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>. He was transferred to the Quiron Clinic on Monday. The transfer became necessary because of the painter's worsened condition and the need for more sophisticated medical facilities, <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON>, a clinic spokesman, said on Spanish national television. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> has lived in the Galatea Tower attached to his Dali Theater-Museum in Figueras since he left a hospital in September 1984 after recovering from burns suffered in an electrical fire. Figueras Mayor <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorca </PERSON>, a member of the board of the <ORGANIZATION> Dali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> the painter's condition was `` very worrisome.'' <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>, one of the founders of the surrealist movement, is the last member of an outstanding generation of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> painters that included <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, who died in 1973, and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miro </PERSON>, who died a decade late, and has lived in seclusion since the death of his wife <PERSON> Gala </PERSON> in 1982.

<TEXT>
 About 300 women's rights activists from throughout the world protested outside Premier <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office on Monday as he met with backers of a proposal to tighten qualifications for being an Israeli Jew <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also met separately Monday with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish leaders, who are upset that the proposal could alienate many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews who now strongly support <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>, both <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democrats and both former congresswomen, were among those protesting while <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> met with the leaders of the ultra-Orthodox political parties, who are pushing for the stricter Israeli immigration law. The proposed law would outlaw non-Orthodox conversions to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and has outraged many American Jews, most of whom belong to the faith's Reform and Convervative movements. The ultra-Orthodox parties have demanded the change as a price for joining a coaltion government with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> moved to reopen talks toward forming a government with the rival, left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> officials insisted they will keep their promises to small religious parties to amend the law. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> met Monday with the ultra-Orthodox <ORGANIZATION> Torah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flag </ORGANIZATION>, Torah Guardians and National Religious parties. No details on the meeting emerged. Outside his office, feminist protesters from more than 20 nations waved signs, listened to speeches and chanted, `` Women say, do n't change the law! `` This has no business on the political agenda,'' said <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON>. `` This has no business when you have an important crisis in the country and you're trying to put together a coalition.'' <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON> was referring to the nearly yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories and the efforts of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, which narrowly won the most seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in the Nov. 1 election, to forge a coalition government. <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> argued against the Israeli government's view that a change in the law is an internal matter. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has asked me many times in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to act in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to provide money, to speak out on behalf of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` They want all of us to come here, and yet, on the other hand, they thumb their noses now with this proposed amendment.'' <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON> and <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> were in the country as part of a four-day International Jewish Feminist Conference. Leaders of the B'nai B'rith met with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> shortly after the protest to voice their concern. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the centrality of our religion, whether we are Reform, Conservative or Orthodox and we want to keep that feeling alive,'' said <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, president of B'nai B'rith International. `` If the law changes the feeling might be diminished.'' <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said B'nai B'rith's 500,000 members in 41 countries were united in their opposition to the amendment. He said the American Jewish community is likely to reduce its finiancial contributions to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if the law is passed. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> said: `` I do n't believe that those who proposed a change in the law recognize the depth of feeling felt by many non-Orthodox Jews toward this law which they feel excludes them.''

<HEAD>Army Trucks Ordered To Help Commuters Hit By French Tranist Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Socialist government is ordering out army trucks to carry suburban commuters stranded by a transit strike, Transport Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON> announced on national television Monday. <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON> accused the Communist-led General Confederation of Labor -LRB- CGT -RRB-, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s largest union and the one which called the strike, of waging `` a sort of union guerrilla warfare of harassment. This is not in the French union tradition.'' He said that besides paralyzing two lines of the regional express rail network on Monday, striking transit workers blocked buses in their terminals and flattened tires and sabotaged engines. He said management of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> regional transit agency will be directed to stop paying strikers' salaries and to start disciplinary actions against those who broke labor laws. More moderate unions have criticized <ORGANIZATION> CGT </ORGANIZATION> strike leadership, but some members of other unions and non-union members are taking part in the walkout. <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said it will be Wednesday morning before the first 140 army trucks were available, with eventually 400 vehicles and 1,000 soldiers to be put at the disposition of local authorities to assure transport. The government of Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> has been unsettled by a wave of strikes by nurses, postal employees, government office workers and other public service employees in recent months. But <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> insists that inflationary wage increases can not be allowed. <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Queyranne </PERSON> said he wondered `` if the <ORGANIZATION> CGT </ORGANIZATION> really wants negotiations to succeed and does it want the disruption to increase and the conflict to continue?'' <ORGANIZATION> CGT </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasucki </PERSON> dismissed as `` completely stupid'' suggestions that the strikes were intended to increase Communist chances at the expense of the Socialists in next spring's municipal elections <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON> asked, `` Why would taking hundreds of thousands of riders hostage, which is what has happened, lead these riders to vote in the municipal elections for those who incited this kind of union guerrilla warfare?'' <ORGANIZATION> CGT </ORGANIZATION> members have said they want safety improvements and across-the-board pay increases of $ 170 per month. Besides stopping two of the four lines of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, the strike also affected some Metro service, with between 67 and 85 percent of the normal number of trains running on five lines. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousselot </PERSON>, director general of the transit agency, said on French TV no new negotiations were planned with the unions representing the workers. The CGT-led strike was to last at least through Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> RIO </LOCATION> <LOCATION> DE </LOCATION> <LOCATION> JANEIRO </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- About 50 heavily armed state and local police stormed a hillside Rio shantytown in daylong drug raids on Monday, killing eight people and arresting five, officials said. Police burst into wood and brick huts in the Providence hillside community, looking for drug runners and petty criminals, and exchanged intense gunfire with traffickers hiding in the community of about 3,000, according to federal police spokesman <PERSON> Geovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Azevedo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Azevedo </PERSON> said six drug runners, all under 25 years old, were cornered and shot to death in a school, which was closed at the time, and two others were killed by gunfire in a nearby cemetery. The action was part of a new local government policy of clearing out drug runners from outlying and hillside slums. The Rio shantytowns have become home to criminals, who set their own law there and protect dwellers from routine crime. Critics accused police of allowing drug runners to set deep roots in the Rio slums and also of cooperating with organized crime in some cases.

 A federal grand jury investigating <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and several of his former aides reconvened Monday amid speculation that indictments could be returned as early as the end of the week. `` It's anybody's guess,'' said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hendersonville </LOCATION>. `` All we can do right now is sit around and wait. `` I would think they're not quite to that -LRB- indictments -RRB- but they're not far from it,'' he said. `` They're still taking testimony. I guess we could all be surprised. We're certainly getting closer.'' <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said earlier that he believes <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> will be indicted. `` It's a question of when,'' he said, `` and what the particular allegations will be.'' The 23-member grand jury went back to work Monday morning, hearing testimony from a number of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> `` lifetime partners,'' people who contributed money to the ministry in exchange for hotel lodging at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the Christian theme park run by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who resigned as <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> president in March 1987 after the revelation that he had a tryst with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and paid her hush money, has denied any criminal wrongdoing. He has called the grand jury investigation `` a fishing expedition.'' Three months ago he predicted: `` I do n't think I'll be indicted. I never have. If I am, I'll be shocked.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, the federal prosecutor handling the 16-month-old investigation, wrote <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and at least two of his former associates last month informing them that they were targets of the probe and inviting them to appear before the grand jury this week. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> declined the invitation, but one of the others, <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s chief builder under <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, indicated last week he might testify before the grand jury. As of late Monday, however, <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> had not shown up at the federal courthouse in downtown <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, where the special panel is conducting its investigation behind closed doors. <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said the timing of the indictments depends on whether <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> agrees to testify or not. `` My feeling is that if he does -LRB- testify -RRB- it would eat up a good deal of time,'' he said. `` At this point, I have not heard that he is not -LRB- going to appear -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said he has had several telephone conversations with <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, and his expectation that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> will be indicted is `` just my impression based on my experience and the conversations. I think that's consistent with the kind of talk he's -LRB- <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> -RRB- given me.'' <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> speculated the indictments would be returned the week of Dec. 12, but he did not dismiss the possibility that they could come as early as this week. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> has been preaching at his new church, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 `` Scrooged,'' the retelling of the <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> Christmas classic starring comedian <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, opened to huge box-office business in the first big week of holiday movie going. According to preliminary figures released Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, `` Scrooged'' collected $ 13 million during the weekend, easily topping second-place finisher `` The Land Before Time.'' `` Scrooged,'' based on <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' `` A Christmas <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>,'' was greeted coolly by critics, but set a record for the best five-day Thanksgiving opening -LRB- $ 18.5 million -RRB- for a non-sequel movie. All box-office proceeds, in fact, were significantly higher than last weekend, thanks to the holiday and a flurry of new releases. `` The Land Before Time,'' which a week ago enjoyed the best opening ever for an animated film, collected $ 8.1 million. The film tells the story of a baby brontosaurus' dangerous journey through a prehistoric world. Another animated movie, `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>,'' finished third, up a notch from last week. `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>,'' employing a variety of celebrity voices for the tale of a homeless kitten, grossed $ 6.3 million. The story was inspired by another <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> tale, `` Oliver Twist.'' Debuting at No. 4 was the sequel `` Cocoon: The Return,'' an updated look at a group of senior citizens enjoying everlasting youth, with revenues of $ 5.6 million. It was followed by `` Ernest Saves Christmas,'' in which an oddball cab driver -LRB- <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Varney </PERSON> -RRB- saves the holidays by driving <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s sleigh. The movie had sales of $ 5.2 million. The horror movie `` Child's Play,'' featuring a homicidal doll on the rampage, finished sixth with $ 4.6 million in sales. `` High Spirits,'' starring <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON> as the proprietor of a ghost-infested Irish castle, ended up seventh with receipts of $ 2 million. In eighth place was `` The Accused,'' starring <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON>, with sales of $ 1.6 million. Rounding out the Top 10 were `` Fresh Horses,'' with <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringwald </PERSON>, collecting $ 1.55 million in ninth and `` Iron Eagle II,'' starring <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON>, with a reported gross of $ 1.35 million in 10th.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday let stand a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> law that the state has used to prosecute parents who educate their children at home without being certified as teachers. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> is considered to have the strongest restrictions on home schooling, and Monday was the second time since 1985 the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has rejected without comment an appeal of the issue. But opponents, saying the law violates their right to practice their religion freely, said they remained hopeful of overturning the law eventually. `` Like with a lot of other movements, it takes a while to get the right case into the court at the right time,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Birst </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are plenty of opportunities to get other appeals there, too.'' In challenging the law, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, formerly of <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> <PERSON> Dagley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mandan </LOCATION> said they believe <PERSON> God </PERSON> gave them responsibility for their children, including their education, and that sending them to school away from home would violate their religious convictions. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dagley </PERSON> said he and his wife will continue teaching their five children at home, despite the setback Monday. `` We made a decision a long time ago that we were going to obey God to the best of our ability,'' he said. `` We could be wrong. But the way we understand what the Bible teaches is that we're supposed to do this. ... Whatever has happened has n't changed our viewpoints at all.'' The Andersons were fined $ 1,000 and the Dagleys $ 500 for violating the state's compulsory school attendance law. The ruling shows it is not `` an unduly intrusive requirement to ask that they -LRB- parents -RRB- provide a certified teacher or be one themselves,'' said state Superintendent of Public Instruction <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanstead </PERSON>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> is the only state that requires a parent to be a certified teacher to educate a child at home, said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> has a law requiring teacher certification in home schools, but the state has stopped enforcing it for one year while legislation is being considered to lift the requirement, he said Most states require parents who wish to teach their children at home to notify state officials about those plans, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Students' progress is then monitored through standardized tests or independent evaluations, he said. Most states have recognized the right of parents to teach their children and `` what they have done is judged the product,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` How you get there is irrelevant.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> may have refused to hear appeals of criminal convictions stemming from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s compulsory attendance law because the issue affects so few people `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> is an aberration,'' he said. At least 100 families are conducting illegal home schools in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and 17 families have been prosecuted in the past five years, <PERSON> Birst </PERSON> said. Fifteen home schools are operating with state approval, according to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruction </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Andersons </ORGANIZATION> moved to <LOCATION> Eau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, in part because of the home school controversy in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and also for employment reasons. The parents teach their children at home in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Birst </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the compulsory attendance law last June, ruling the state's `` compelling interest in the education of children'' permits some restriction on the free exercise of religion. The only question is `` whether or not the state has chosen the least restrictive alternative to achieve its compelling interest,'' the state court said. It said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> could choose another system, such as authorizing visits to homes by state officials and monitoring the children's educational process. But the court said that alternative might mean a more intrusive role for the state in supervising the religious training of children. After the 1987 Legislature refused to change the compulsory attendance law, a committee of leaders in education, religion and law, appointed by Attorney General <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON>, failed to reach a compromise in the longstanding dispute to recommend to the 1989 Legislature.

 President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Monday made his first visit to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> since taking office nine years ago for talks with President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> on Palestinian problems. Both leaders asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reconsider its decision Saturday to bar <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, from entering the country to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said he was `` surprised by this narrow-minded attitude from a superpower such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> which contradicts its commitments to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The agency said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> expressed hope that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would revise its action `` because this decision represents an offense not only to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> but also to all Arabs and the whole world.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> made a similar appeal to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier in the day. `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> going to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> would not cause problems for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said. `` I think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should have encourged this step because it is an important step by the Palestinians.'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> told reporters at <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> International Airport his visit to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was to discuss `` all matters of common concern to the two countries and the Arab world in political, economic and other fields,'' with top priority going to the Palestinian question, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> announced Sunday that their foreign ministers had canceled plans to go to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> for the debate on Palestinian issues set to open Dec. 1. After meeting <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> for lunch, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told reporters they exchanged views on a number of issues including the Iran-Iraq peace talks and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rejection of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s 10-hour visit to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was his first since taking office in 1979. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has visited <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> three times in the past two years. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> severed diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1979 to protest its peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and resumed diplomatic relations in November 1987.

 Friend and foe alike criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Monday for denying <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> debate on the Palestinian issue. Only <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> supported the decision. Most said the denial, announced Saturday by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, violated provisions of the 1947 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Headquarters Agreement requiring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> not to interfere with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> business. Many said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action countered what they described as the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s move toward moderation with its declaration of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> independence Nov. 15 that also implicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> called <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rejection of his application `` a sheer violation of international law.'' `` Why are they afraid that I speak to world public opinion and explain the new Palestinian decisions?'' he said to reporters in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Not even <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s staunchest ally in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, expressed approval. Friends asked <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to reconsider and some <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations pressed for the debate to be held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> so <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> could attend. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would be given a forum for addressing the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> but did not specify a location. <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders to sever relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His official news agency quoted a letter to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> kings and presidents as saying: `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has shown enough scorn towards the Arab nation. Whenever she slaps our right cheek we turn the other one. And therefore, relations with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have become ... a shame in the face of every Arab.'' The statement issued by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was denied a visa because he was an `` accessory'' to terrorism committed by `` PLO elements.'' Only <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> welcomed it. An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said: `` Maybe now part of the world will have to re-examine the situation and take another look at the record of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. It's quite a bloody record.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> formally conveyed its opposition to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to both <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, External Affairs Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said in a statement. `` We believe there is merit in hearing Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s views in an international forum so that we and others can assess whether there has been any change in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s position on the peace process in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, called the visa denial `` an unconstructive and illegal step.'' He said it `` raises serious obstacles'' to peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and `` is deterimental to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> prestige and authority.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has failed to live up to the expectations of the world community, and its decision has cast a dark shadow on the new hope for ending the prolonged Arab-Israeli conflict.'' A British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said granting a visa was `` a matter for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to decide'' but <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> `` would have liked to hear <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> confirm in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> favored a settlement based on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338, and that it had renounced terrorism.'' The resolutions implicitly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and acceptance of them has been a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> condition for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Declarations issued Nov. 15 by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature, restricted <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> attacks to military targets in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Israeli-occupied territories but did not specifically renounce terrorism. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said the decision was a blow to peace. <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON>, spokesman for Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, said: `` The universal task of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and its function as a place for conflict arbitration was not considered.'' Other European nations criticizing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> included <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, also complained. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s executive commission, said in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> he was `` surprised and disappointed. He said he spoke as a private citizen. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s independent newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> said the decision was `` indefensible'' and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s daily <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> called it `` an appalling manifestation of imperialisti arrogance.'' <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has its headquarters, said refusing the visa `` hinders the work of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> as an instrument for bringing about peace and security in the world.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s official news agency said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision did not `` harmonize with its principles of freedom, justice and peace in the world.'' The Saudis are among the strongest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, two other Arab states with ties to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, recommended moving the <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> debate to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> said: `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s going to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> would not cause problems for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should have encouraged this step because it is an important step by the Palestinians.''

<HEAD>University's Dorm Rules Relax Overnight Guest Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A ban on overnight dormitory guests that set off an uproar at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was slightly relaxed Monday, but students still wo n't be able to play host to unrelated members of the opposite sex. University President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> announced he had accepted with `` minor modifications'' recommendations of a task force appointed to study the strict new rules after thousands of students demonstrated against the policy. In his decision, <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> limited overnight guests of the opposite sex to family members. Visits between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. will have to be approved in writing by all roommates 24 hours in advance. `` The university recognizes and welcomes the fact that college years are a time when young people change and mature _ in part through testing their increased freedom and increased responsibility for the conduct of their own lives. `` But this testing must be carried out within the bounds of good manners,'' <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> wrote in a letter to the task force. The recommendations are n't substantially different than <PERSON> Silber </PERSON>'s original ban, said student <PERSON> Susheel </PERSON> <PERSON> Srikonda </PERSON>, who, along with another student, formed a group called Active, Concerned, Together to fight the new policies The student group advocated a different approach that emphasized roommate approval and gave the resident assistants who are in charge of dormitories a larger role. University spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carleton </PERSON> said he believed the task force's recommendations were much more relaxed than the ban. `` The initial policy that was proposed was that there be no overnight guests,'' he said. `` The tone of it was to discourage overnight guests. This is saying that there certainly can be overnight guests. It describes the format in which that can occur.'' Controversy over the rules, which were announced in September, was broadcast on national television after talk-show host <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> visited campus to talk to administration officials and student leaders. On Nov. 21, the task force gave <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> several recommendations, including suggestions that overnight guests be allowed only at certain times in the semester, a maximum of five times each semester and only with approval from all roommates. <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> said in his letter he limited overnight guests to family members out of consideration to parents `` who are, in a proportion of about 30 to 1, opposed to overnight visitors of the opposite sex.'' He conceded that the university can not police dormitories rigorously but said the school is obliged to discourage certain behavior. <PERSON> Carleton </PERSON> said the new rules probably will go into effect next fall, although some technical details remain to be worked out.

 Opposition party supporters who seized 30 city halls throughout <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state during the weekend still occupied five municipal buildings late Monday, state officials said. <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state spokesman <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Palomino </PERSON> said activists voluntarily left most of the city halls. But the Excelsior news service quoted other opposition activists as saying police and military forces drove many away. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, on Monday denied that police were sent to end the occupations, saying `` it was the army.

He said troops also were dispatched to prevent activists from taking over other city halls. Front activists said they were occupying the city halls to press their demands that <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Villicana </PERSON> resign. The governor was elected to a six-year-term in 1986. But <PERSON> Palomino </PERSON> said some activists told officials `` they were invited to take over the installations to support <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> when he assumes the presidency on Dec. 1.''

 A Japanese department store bought <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s `` Acrobat and Young Harlequin'' for $ 38.46 million Monday night at <ORGANIZATION> Christie </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, the highest price ever paid at auction for a 20th century work of art The painting was purchased by the <ORGANIZATION> Mitsukoshi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION>, store spokesman <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` We bought the painting expecting to sell it to a private buyer here in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsukoshi </ORGANIZATION>, a major importer of art, has not yet decided on specific plans for the display or sale of the painting, <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said. A picture by the French Impressionist <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>, `` The Railroad Bridge at <LOCATION> Argenteuil </LOCATION>,'' sold for $ 12.55 million, also joining the list of the 10 most expensive works of art sold at auction. In June 28, another <ORGANIZATION> Monet </ORGANIZATION> painting, `` In the Field,'' sold at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for $ 24.90 million. Spokesmen for the auction house did not disclose the purchaser or the seller of the Picasso painting. They only identified the seller as a private owner. The 1905 work from the artist's Rose Period was sold in 3 -LCB- minutes. Bidding opened at 5 million pounds -LRB- $ 9.2 million -RRB- and ended at 20.9 million pounds -LRB- $ 38.46 million -RRB-. The price topped the previous record for a 20th century painting, $ 24.75 million paid for <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s `` Maternity'' Nov. 14 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Monday's auction of 60 works by 40 artists brought 55.44 million pounds -LRB- $ 102.01 million -RRB-, a record for an Impressionist and modern art sale in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Individual records were set for works by <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Giacometti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Klee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Signac </PERSON>. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s had offered 69 paintings for sale, but nine were withdrawn or did not reach the minimums set by the owners. After being shown in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1905, `` Acrobat and <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harlequin </ORGANIZATION>'' found its way into a German museum and was confiscated by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1937 as an example of decadent art. They sold it at auction in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> to a Belgian collector and it had been in private hands since. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s imports of art and curios have ballooned in recent years as increasingly affluent Japanese turn to collecting as a form of investment. In March 1987, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Sunflowers,'' painted in 1889, sold for $ 39.9 million at <ORGANIZATION> Christie </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Yasuda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese firm. Dealers estimate that at least 30 percent of worldwide art sales are to Japanese buyers _ often large corporations that buy for tax-free investment purposes. <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> did the painting in 1905 in his <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> attic studio at 13 rue Ravignon using gouache, an opaque watercolor easier to handle than oil paint. Auctioneer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Allsopp </PERSON> said the price paid for the painting was by no means exorbitant. `` By any standard, <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> was the towering figure of art in this century. This picture was from his Rose Period, which is usually considered his best, and it's the last great work of that series likely to come on the market,'' <PERSON> Allsopp </PERSON> said. `` In the 27 years I've been here, it has gripped more people and people with a greater variety of tastes than any previous picture. It has had practically no detractors _ even among those who do n't like <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s proposal to lower the benchmark price of crude oil from $ 18 to $ 15 a barrel threatens a tentative accord aimed at reducing the world oil glut and driving up prices. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s oil minister, <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, said late Sunday the proposal was designed to prevent prices from falling below $ 15. But other ministers fear that a minimum price could become the ceiling price. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries currently maintains a benchmark of $ 18 a barrel, but prices recently have been running at $ 14 or less. Each $ 1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means a pickup of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices, although oil companies do not always pass along the full increase.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has abused the world's tropical forests in flagrantly wasteful ways and in the long run may upset the global ecological balance, a group of environmentalists contend. They also claim that with a recent shipment of banned giant raw logs from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has managed to open up the last major timber frontier _ <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ following the near depletion of forest land in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the largest importer of tropical hardwood and we consume the biggest amount,'' said <PERSON> Saburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Okita </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> chapter of the World Wide Fund for Nature, known as the World Wildlife Fund in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> imports 60 percent of the 421 million cubic feet of timber it uses annually. Some of the wood goes into disposable chopsticks and panels for poured-concrete forms on construction projects. <PERSON> Yuta </PERSON> <PERSON> Harago </PERSON>, a wildlife fund consultant, calls these wasteful uses for which alternatives can be found. `` Ten percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s industrial waste alone is made up of the discarded wood used for the paneling,'' he said. <PERSON> Okita </PERSON> and fund officials spoke at news conferences marking the recent meeting in <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which groups countries that produce and consume timber. <PERSON> Okita </PERSON>, a former foreign minister, said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> overuses foreign timber because it was easily available at low prices during the reconstruction period after World War II. Because of that, the local timber industry ignores the forests covering 70 percent of the Japanese islands, <PERSON> Okita </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> of the World Wildlife Fund said the Japanese forestry industry has limited cutting to try to sustain its supply of trees, and so domestic hardwood is more expensive than imports. Most of the timber comes from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> where some forests have been virtually stripped clean. `` And <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is also in very bad shape,'' said <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Centeno </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. `` So the interest of the world trade is turning toward <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because the forests are still there and the possibility of its exports are just beginning to show,'' <PERSON> Centeno </PERSON> said. According to the wildlife fund, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has 60 percent of the world's tropical forests while its exports constitute only 5 percent of the global trade. `` Many people agree that <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is going to play a very important role in the tropical timber trade by the end of the century,'' said <PERSON> Centeno </PERSON>. Over the past few years several <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> timber producing nations have banned the export of raw logs to let their forests recover. In October, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> also announced it will prohibit the sale of the logs in answer to international criticism over the destruction of its <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> forests. But in early November, 386,100 cubic feet of Brazilian raw logs arrived in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the result of a loophole in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s ban, said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, the wildlife fund's campaigns officer `` The reason given for the imported logs is that the land is going to have to be cleared anyway because the forests will be flooded by hydroelectric dams,'' he said. With a special permit, the Brazilian timber industry was able to sell the logs to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Centeno </PERSON> said other countries in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will want to open up their forests because of `` unfair competition'' from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. `` If you can get a special permit with this argument -LRB- the dam project -RRB-, you can get another permit for expanding the agricultural frontier or the building of ranches or any other argument practically,'' he added. Uprooting trees worldwide will eventually have `` very strong consequences on the environment,'' <PERSON> Centeno </PERSON> said. `` There is discussion whether destruction of the forests will affect the temperature of the planet, the winds, rains. It may have worldwide ecological damage,'' he said. <PERSON> Motokatsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s liaison officer with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said the private sector in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has not seen the danger of deforestation. A major goal for the government, he said, is to increase public awareness of environmental matters.

<BYLINE>Snail Farming in Britain: Is it Really Escargot?
^By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RODE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dozens of tiny snail farms are popping up across <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and the growing interest in the new industry is threatening an escargot glut. Despite a lingering British prejudice against snails as mere garden pests, consumption is growing at an estimated 10 to 20 percent a year, and a feud has already erupted over what constitutes an escargot. On one side is a group led by a Frenchman backing the helix snail, the traditional favorite of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. On the other are farmers championing the fast-breeding achatina snail, which the French have recently deemed unfit to be called escargot. `` The war is declared as far as the escargot is concerned,'' says <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Aubree </PERSON>, the Frenchman whose British <ORGANIZATION> Snail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has enlisted 54 growers since 1986 to breed the helix snails he calls the `` aristocrat of escargot.'' `` What's an escargot anyway? It's a snail,'' retorts <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Groves </PERSON>, founder of The <ORGANIZATION> Snail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a Welsh-based group that claims 300 members worldwide, including 40 British farmers breeding achatina indoors in pens. <PERSON> Aubree </PERSON>, who tells visitors to his farm in Rode, near Bath, to tread carefully to avoid `` stepping on my profit,'' believes the tropical achatina are less tasty than the helix he grows outdoors on pesticide-free land. The French agree, and passed a law in May forbidding achatina to be called escargot. The intent was to stop unscrupulous restaurateurs from putting achatina meat in helix shells. `` If people in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are prepared to eat slugs in fancy shells, I do n't care,'' said <PERSON> Aubree </PERSON>, a former chef, speaking of the achatina's larger shells. Says Groves: `` We do n't have preconceived ideas in this country. ... The achatina is an excellent edible snail.'' He notes that his snails can be harvested more quickly than the helix breed, although they sell for 1.60 pounds -LRB- $ 2.90 -RRB- a pound, compared with 2.30 pounds -LRB- $ 4.15 -RRB- a pound for helix. The National Farmers' Union estimates annual British consumption at 90 tons at most, compared with 10,000 to 12,000 tons in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the world's No. 1 consumer, which imports half its supply, mainly from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` There is no doubt that in the majority of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> people's minds, it's still that lump of rubber served in garlic butter,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, whose 72-member cooperative <PERSON> Britsnail </PERSON> was founded this year to sell both achatina and helix snails `` It will take time to establish the snail,'' he added. `` I think if the industry is going to go ahead, it has to consolidate. `` I say, ` Look gentlemen, forget your differences, we are trying to produce a British crop like sheep and goats and anything else,''' he said. With the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> estimating that each farmer could produce six tons a year of helix and 15 tons of achatina, officials worry about how many more snail farmers <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> can handle. `` There is room for expansion but ... we're very chary about encouraging people in joining an industry so embryonic,'' said an official of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. The farmers' union says it is worried about a snail surplus that would lower prices and quality. Still, snail farmers like <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Candy </PERSON>, a helix-grower in <LOCATION> Aubree </LOCATION>'s cooperative, believe their product has a future The Candys, who saw snails as a way to branch out from dairy cows and corn on their farm near <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, have n't sold any snails but are optimistic. `` They're restful,'' she said. `` It's a bit like tropical fish. You ca n't really get annoyed with a snail. ... They do n't rampage about and knock things over.''

<HEAD>Group in Spain out to Ban Bullfighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSE TINSLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ban bullfighting in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>? It's as if someone wanted to ban baseball in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But a group of Spaniards, nevertheless, wants to put an end to what it sees as cruelty in the bullring. The Spanish <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and several <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> deputies have launched a Europe-wide petition drive calling on governments to adopt legislation that would ban bullfighting in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and fox hunting in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The petition, which organizers say would carry half a million signatures, is to be given to Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in January in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, shortly after <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> assumes the rotating presidency of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> for the first time. While organizers want animal protection legislation passed in all 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member states, the petition is aimed specifically at ending or `` modernizing'' bullfighting in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and doing away with the torturing or killing of animals during many traditional religious festivals around the country. Making bullfighting `` modern'' or acceptable to opponents would involve eliminating the picadors on horseback who lance the bull to weaken its neck muscles so its head goes down, the banderilleros who spike the animal's neck muscles with three pairs of long darts, and the final act _ the moment of truth _ when the matador stabs the bull between the shoulder blades and through the heart. In neighboring <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, the bull is picked lightly by a bullfighter on horseback, then grabbed by the tail by a group of men called `` forcados'' and wrestled around until it is dazed. The bull does not die in the ring but is slaughtered shortly afterward in packing-house fashion. The proposed legislation would also eliminate the use of horses during bullfights, prohibit young people from attending and force televised fights into a late-night time slot when children are in bed. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Briones </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> which oversees bullfighting, said the government had no official comment on the subject. But <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> said he personally feels bullfighting is part of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> culture and should be maintained. Bullfighting is considered an art rather than a sport in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. This past season, 23 million people attended bullfights in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, 3 million more than 1987. The capitals of 49 of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s 52 provinces have permament bullrings, and during the summer months portable rings are set up in thousands of towns and villages for their annual fiestas. The number of major fights rose 11 percent this year to 566, the highest number in the past decade. A first-class bullfighter earns from $ 27,000 to $ 35,000 to fight three bulls in an afternoon during the big fiestas in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pamplona </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Zaragoza </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Malaga </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s leading bullfighter of the moment, <PERSON> Espartaco </PERSON>, fought 82 `` corridas'' _ three-bull afternoons _ during the past season. Bullfighting and animal sacrifice in religious festivals are centuries-old traditions in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercedes </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON>, the mother of King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>, is an avid bullfight aficionada, and the king occasionally makes an appearance at <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ventas </LOCATION> ring, the world's largest. Last year the government of the autonomous region of <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> banned the torturing and sacrificing of animals in religious festivals but still permits bullfighting. The Spanish <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of 2,000 members and 8,000 contributors, says <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is the only <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> country that does not consider mistreatment of animals a criminal offense. The association's vice president, <PERSON> Consuelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON>, said there has been a resurgence of ritualistic street festivals since the death in 1975 of Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>, who banned animal taunting and sacrifice connected with them during his 36 years of authoritarian rule. `` They do n't think it's a fiesta unless they have bulls running through the streets,'' she said. On most Sundays during the bullfighting season _ March to October _ association members stand outside bullrings, at <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s Prado Museum and on the southern Costa del Sol beaches handing out literature in an effort to discourage tourists from attending bullfights. But <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON>, a bullfighter for 14 years, says Spaniards not only respect the bullfighters but the bull for its courage and beauty. `` It's an art that is sometimes misunderstood by foreigners,'' he said.

<HEAD>Making Money in Stocks Requires Consistency and Persistence</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The greatest financial gift that most young people could receive is a lesson in how persistence and consistency can lead to enormous rewards in the stock market. Alas, the course laid out is seldom followed. The route chosen is often a bumpy one; shortcuts lead to dead ends and detours that dissipate both the funds and a sense of the original goal. But in theory if not in practice, the route is a simple one of investing, reinvesting dividends as they are earned, and waiting. A common stock investment of $ 1,000 made at the end of 1925, for example, would have grown to more than $ 375,000 at the end of 1987 if left alone. That same $ 1,000 invested in small company stocks would have reached $ 1.45 million. These calculations were made by <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON>, a mathematician and chairman of the Chicago-based advisory firm <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. In the first instance the annual return was a nominal 9.9 percent. In the second, the smaller company stocks would have returned 12.1 percent. You can be certain, however, that few if any individuals ever followed that simple route for the length of time required. Dividends would have been spent rather than reinvested. Fundn 62 years. And in real terms, it lost 60 percent of its purchasing power. It is a lesson for all ages. If you are 20 years old you should keep it in mind for your own retirement. If you are 65, put some money away for your grandchildren and great-grandchildren. And tie it up in a hands-off trust.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, a stocky, vigorous man of robust health and immense appetite for his job, walked out of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> one Friday in late August and was not seen again in public for two weeks. The absence was without precedent since <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> took power by coup 34 years ago and was unexplained to Paraguayans accustomed to seeing him virtually every day on television or the front page of <ORGANIZATION> Patria </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. What happened was that the 76-year-old <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> _ who, according to government propaganda, never gets sick, never takes vacations and spends part of almost every day on the job _ underwent a prostate operation. To this day, that has not been publicly reported to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s 4 million people. Many officials wo n't speak of it even privately, holding to the government version that <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> had a routine medical checkup and is fine. `` We asked him, ` Why do n't we issue an official bulletin saying you had a prostate operation?''' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiola </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. He said <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> refused on grounds that his health was his own affair. Opponents hold, however, that <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s health is a public issue because it affects his capacity to rule, and they do n't believe he is well He no longer arrives for work just after sunrise and leaves before noon. He receives fewer people than before and passes on to his aides the work he used to do himself. Those who have seen him says he walks and speaks slowly, and looks pallid. `` For television, they only let the photographers take pictures from far away, and at an angle,'' said <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON>, owner of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Color </ORGANIZATION>, which was closed by the government in 1984. `` A year ago, the pictures were in clear focus.'' `` He has aged visibly. He has lost his force,'' said Roman Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Melanio </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, an outspoken critic of the regime. `` There is a feeling that he wo n't be around for long.'' Rumors swept this sleepy, steamy capital the first week of September that he had died. Many were left dumbstruck. `` It demonstrated his fallibility,'' said <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a group denied formal recognition by the government but which may be <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s largest opposition group. `` It pushed people to think post-Stroessner.'' <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Chiola </PERSON>, who also is vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, acknowleged as much in an interview in his office at the Legislative Palace. `` Nobody in the country thought he could get sick,'' said <PERSON> Chiola </PERSON>. `` Now, people are thinking that at some point there will have to be a succession.'' <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s seizure of power in 1954 ended a 22-year period of anarchy and misrule in which <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> suffered a war with <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, a civil war, and a dozen presidents. For more than three decades, he has provided stability, if not social peace, to a country that since independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1811 almost never has had free elections, independent political institutions or fair party competition. <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, a former congressional deputy who has been imprisoned and exiled, and others see <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in decline. They are pressing for a transition to a representative government in which they can participate. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, to which the majority of Paraguayans nominally belong, advocates constitutional reform, an amnesty of political prisoners, a crackdown on contraband and corruption, a raise in the minimum wage, equal rights for women. There's grumbling even within the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which claims a membership of 1.4 million. Students at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> are joining dissident organizations, and party regulars are split between `` militants'' who unswervingly back <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and `` traditionalists'' who do not. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has abandoned many of its flags _ unions, farmers _ and turned into a massive bureaucracy,'' claimed <PERSON> Leandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Prieto </PERSON> <PERSON> Yegros </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Insfran </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s interior minister in 1956-66, said, `` <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> has lost a lot of support within the past few years.

 Says <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>: `` You ca n't find someone in the hospital who does n't think about it frequently. This does n't mean that people with AIDS receive poor care from quaking doctors and nurses. While some surgeons are reluctant to operate and some nurses may try to minimize contact, experts say there are plenty of others who selflessly put aside their apprehensions. At many hospitals, teams of doctors and nurses have evolved who are intensely protective of their AIDS patients, treating them with compassion and skill. Often the most timid are those who have, perhaps by choice, the least direct contact with the disease. Dr. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotton </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> says the intensity of this fear is often out of proportion to the risk of catching it. `` As a group, health care workers are probably no more or less fearful than the general public, and that's of great concern,'' she says. `` They should clearly be less fearful. They have more information.'' Reasonable caution in the hospital makes sense. Ordinary contact with infected people is safe, but doctors and nurses can catch the virus if infected blood mingles with their own, entering their bodies through a cut or a needle jab. The risk is probably highest in the operating room, the emergency room and the delivery room, the bloodiest places in the hospital. According to Dr. <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerberding </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION>, 23 cases of probable on-the-job infection of health care workers have been reported around the world, although there undoubtedly are other cases that have n't come to public attention. They are 14 nurses, six lab workers, one non-surgical physician, one dentist and one home health care provider. All had direct contact with AIDS-infected blood, most often accidental needle sticks. The virus is hard to catch. Even when jabbed by a needle covered with infected blood, the odds of infection are longer than 1 in 200. However, jabs and cuts are common, especially in the operating room. According to one estimate, emergency department surgeons who operate on lots of infected people may have a 2 percent annual risk of catching the AIDS virus while working. Outright refusal to treat infected people is rare, although it does happen. `` It's hard to go near a teaching hospital in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where somebody who treats persons with AIDS has not had somebody refuse or hesitate to do an invasive procedure,'' says <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, who teaches humanities in medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>. It is more than an understandable reluctance to get sick and die, several doctors say. It is a reluctance to get sick and die for people that physicians do n't like. `` We associate the AIDS epidemic with drug abusers and homosexuals,'' says <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>. `` In the back of your mind, you say, ` I'm not going to die for this.''' There are strong ethical taboos against refusing to treat someone solely out of fear of catching his disease. But doctors may safely hide behind another shield _ simple ignorance. Some experts say that many primary care physicians have failed to learn about AIDS so they can refer infected people elsewhere. They can say, quite honestly, that they are not competent to treat their condition. `` If it was some other disease, would physicians become more rapidly informed about it?'' asked Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think that a lot of what the patients perceive as rejection at a very vulnerable time in their lives is more reluctance on the part of doctors to get involved than it is outright hostility toward them, although that occurs, also.'' Many physicians complain that surgeons are more likely to say that operations are unnecessary if patients are infected. At hospitals with large numbers of AIDS patients, AIDS referral networks have grown up. Internists send their patients to surgeons, radiologists and other specialists who they know will take their patients without quibbling. One of the few people to study these attitudes is Dr. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Link </PERSON>, an internist at <ORGANIZATION> Bellevue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He surveyed interns and residents at two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hospitals and found that about 40 percent reported moderate or major concern about getting AIDS from their patients. A quarter say that if given a choice, they would not take care of people with the disease. `` By far, the biggest issue was fear of contagion to themselves,'' says Link. `` That's human nature. Above all else, you're worried about your own hide.''

 When surgeons reach into patients' incisions, many of them want to know if they are dipping their hands in AIDS-infected blood. Doctors and nurses frequently worry about catching AIDS from their patients. But the concern is probably nowhere deeper than in the operating room. Surgeons frequently cut and puncture their fingers. Knives and fine thread effortlessly slice through latex gloves, their only protection. `` Talk to cardiac surgeons whose hands are often in blood,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, an infectious disease expert at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Medical Center. `` They often nick themselves and yeah, it bothers the hell out of them. It's easy to say, ` You've taken an oath that says you've got to operate on everybody,' but these guys are putting themselves at risk, and they make cogent arguments for wanting to know the status of the patient in terms of HIV infection.'' Infectious disease specialists such as <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> urge surgeons to assume that every patient is infected and take all possible precautions with all of them. They and many other non-surgical physicians oppose broad-based AIDS screening of hospital patients. They argue that results showing infection may be hard to keep secret, and they could lead to discrimination, even a refusal to perform an operation or other procedure. There is also a minuscule chance that the test will fail to spot people who are infected, so screening might encourage a misplaced sense of security. Surgeons respond that when a patient is infected, they have a right to know it. If they know they are operating on an infected patient, they will be extra careful and take precautions that are impractical for all operations. As a result, some surgeons ask patients for permission to check their blood for the AIDS virus, HIV, before surgery. `` In the operating room, we have pump technicians, circulators, anesthesiologists, scrub nurses,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are talking about a lot of people and a big investment in their future and education. They have a right to know if the patient is positive or not. You'll be five times more careful and double-glove wherever you stick your finger.'' Generally, doctors ask permission before AIDS testing, and in some states such approval is legally required. Some surgeons screen all patients, while others check only homosexuals, drug addicts or anyone else who might be at high risk of infection. Doctors say the patients rarely refuse. `` I think it's quite reasonable to ask a patient who is at some risk if he can be tested. I think most of us do it,'' says Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>. `` There may be some patients you might ask, even though they are n't in a risk group, if you have a reason that is more intuitive than factual.'' Some surgeons, however, oppose this use of the test. For instance, Dr. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bothe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deaconess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> says he thinks AIDS testing is justifiable only if it helps the patient, not the doctor. `` What about the patient who comes into the emergency room and you do n't know?'' <PERSON> Bothe </PERSON> asked. `` Do you wait until the test is done? What about patients who have the virus and their test was negative? And then what different is the surgeon going to do?'' None of the 23 victims of probable on-the-job AIDS infection among health care workers reported so far is a surgeon. Whether any of the special precautions they take with infected patients will keep them from getting the virus is unclear. Among those frequently mentioned: _ Wear two pairs of gloves _ Minimize passing sharp instruments between the surgeon and scrub nurse _ Use automatic staplers rather than stitches _ Cut with an electric cautery rather than a scalpel _ Keep medical students out of the operating room _ Make sure the operation is performed by a seasoned surgeon, not an inexperienced resident who might be more likely to cut other people at the operating table

 <LOCATION> BOSTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ New hospital procedures intended to keep doctors and nurses from catching the AIDS virus are spelled out in an evolving series of recommendations known as `` universal precautions.'' The rules are called universal because they are supposed to apply to all patients. Outwardly healthy people may harbor the virus in their blood, so the new practices encourage hospital workers to treat all blood as though it is infected. These precautions, compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, include: _ Gloves should be worn when touching patients' mucous membranes, non-intact skin and a variety of body fluids, including blood, semen, vaginal secretions, spinal fluid and amniotic fluid They should also be worn when handling items soiled with these fluids, giving shots or drawing blood. _ Hands should be washed immediately after gloves are removed _ Masks and protective glasses should be worn during procedures when blood may fly into health workers' faces Soak-proof gowns or aprons should also be used if blood or other fluids are likely to be splattered. _ Health workers should be especially careful not to jab themselves with needles, scalpels or other sharp instruments Needles should not be recapped. After they are used, they should be put in puncture-proof containers. These containers should be conveniently placed around the hospital. _ Mouthpieces or resuscitation bags should be available to minimize the need for emergency mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ When it comes to stamps, millions of citizens seem to have ideas about what should go on them. Pressure and controversy can get pretty intense -LRB- as in behalf of the Elvis Presley stamp -RRB-. That's why the committee that decides meets behind closed doors and never explains its reasoning for picking one subject over another.

 They are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s headstones, its family albums. Stamps. It used to be the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would put <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> -LRB- 282 times -RRB- or <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> -LRB- 133 -RRB- on its postage and hope they would stick. But in the 2,500-plus stamps since the first Washington-Franklins of 1847, postage has become more than just glued paper. Today's stamps are colorful as rainbows, varied as flea markets and one of the most exclusive portrait galleries in the world Every year some 25-30 ,000 native sons, bypassed heroes, worthy causes, deserving luminaries, memorable landscapes and happy birthdays are proposed for a stamp Only 25 or 30 make it. Once upon a time <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, a collector, would call up Postmaster General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> with an idea and tell him to get printing. Today, in the course of human events, a committee decides. Who, how, what, when, where? `` It's about as democratic a process as we have going,'' says <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON>, manager for stamp information at the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The deciders, appointed by the postal commissioners for the last 30 years, are the 13 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stamp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. They meet here six times a year to decide, by majority vote, whom you will be sticking your tongue out at on the way to the post office. The decisions tend to be upbeat. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Earp </PERSON> stands a better chance of being postally canonized than Billy the Kid. -LRB- <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> was proposed and turned down. So was a pretzel with beer-flavored glue -RRB-. It helps to be good looking. We've had cardinals and bald eagles and poinsettias. No turkey buzzards. Beyond the certitude that there will always be a stamp in circulation showing the American flag -LRB- 54 times -RRB- it is difficult to make book on who will make the postal hall of fame. Consider: We have had <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> but not <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>; <PERSON> Babe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> but not <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Maris </PERSON>; <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> but not <PERSON> Zebulon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>; Crazy Horse but not <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> <PERSON> Custer </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> but not Japanese cherry trees; paddy wagons but not <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>; <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassatt </PERSON> but not <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvard </PERSON> but not <PERSON> Elihu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yale </PERSON>; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> but not <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>; jack in the pulpit but not skunk cabbage; a <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> house but not an outhouse -LRB- proposed and flushed -RRB-; <PERSON> Nobelists </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> but not Nobelist <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>; <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> but not King <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>; <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> but not <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>; Feeding the Hungry but not fat farms. Conversely, or perversely, we have had population control and baby carriages, Mexican independence and the Battle of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION>. One might surmise that <PERSON> Custer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> are in limbo because they lost, <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> because he took his own life, <PERSON> Maris </PERSON> because of his asterisk. You'll never know because the committee does n't publicly explain its reasoning When <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvard </PERSON> was stamped in 1986 to celebrate his namesake university's 350th birthday, that opened the door for Yalies and loyal sons and daughters of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, Lord <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Amherst </PERSON> and Col. <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, et al., to demand equal billing. To cool hot potatoes, the post office will not henceforth immortalize college founders. Better news for others. Satchmo may make it because the post office issues a stamp every year honoring the nation's black heritage. The outhouse probably wo n't because, as <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON> says, stamps are `` the nation's calling cards.'' <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> probably will get there, but he's not dead yet. You have to be entombed for at least 10 years to qualify unless you're a president. They're eligible one year after their first posthumous birthday `` We believe someone has to stand the test of time,'' <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON> explains. Love has apparently met that standard. The annual `` love'' stamp sells _ S.W.A.K _ a smashing one billion per issue. The advisory committee is, as are the stamps they select, a cross section. Three are historians. One publishes a graphic arts magazine. An executive of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> is a stamp collector. <PERSON> Digger </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>, a collector and Notre Dame basketball coach, is a member. So is Belmont Fairies, former editor of the canceled <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, TV executive <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, director of sculpture at the National Art Gallery. When the committee meets, <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON> and his staff present the proposals that have flooded in over the transom from a stamp-minded citizenry. Each has had a modicum of research. Some proposals are obvious. Columbus stumbled upon the New World 500 years ago in 1992. World War II for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement will be 50 years old starting in 1991. D-day seems a likely choice. Japanese bombers over <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> do n't. `` We get into some things controversial,'' says <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON>, `` but we do n't want to reflect badly on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>. We do n't build a fire that's not going to warm us There was a 1981 stamp, for instance, that said `` Alcoholism @ You Can Beat It.'' Would the recipient think there was a hidden message beyond the one in the envelope? The committee's closed door discussions can get heated over social concerns or a nominee's worthiness. Some proposals have waited 40 years in the bullpen before making it to stampdom. If the committee remains undecided, it may ask <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON> for further research. Some proposals are accompanied by petitions. `` We neither encourage nor discourage them,'' says <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON>. The commission allows no lobbying before it and does n't credit any proposal. `` We do n't want to get into who was first.''

 The post office sold about 38 billion stamps last year for $ 10,743,000,000. Its employees process through dark of night and mean dogs about half of the world's postal volume. The majority of it is metered although there is a trend back to stamps. Business surveys show people are more apt to open a stamped envelope. Three years ago then-Postmaster General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> declared <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should beautify its postage. Actually the post office started getting away from the blue-gray-rose eminences of Washingtons and Franklins and <ORGANIZATION> Jeffersons </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1950s with brighter colors and pleasing graphics. Some think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is closing fast on the consensus world leaders in pretty postage, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Stamps divide into definitive and commemorative categories. The definitives portray national landmarks, human and geographic, and are the every day stamps for all denominations from a penny to $ 8.75 for Express Mail, the biggest and most expensive. When they run out, they are reprinted. Commemoratives are one-shot editions of 120 to 160 million stamps. They honor everything from Navaho blankets to cigar store Indians, <PERSON> Abigail </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> to <PERSON> Babe </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaharias </PERSON>, blue fin tuna to Boy Scouts, appaloosa horses to ZlP codes, hot air balloons to certified public accountants. Commemoratives are what the nation's 19 million stamp collectors stick in their albums. Collectors provided a $ 157 million profit in 1987 for the post office whose stamps, incidentally, are not tax supported. By law they pay their way. Since all stamps are changed every time there is a postal increase, collecting is a growth industry. Collectors like colors, as does the general public, and things more than people. They are kept coming back by continuing series such as transportation -LRB- iceboats, <PERSON> Stutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bearcats </PERSON>, pushcarts -RRB-, blacks -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Sojourner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truth </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplln </PERSON> -RRB- and the arts -LRB- <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Melville </PERSON>, T.S. <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>, <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON> -RRB-. Size restricts what gets on a stamp. What does an artist do about rivets in a commemorative of the U.S.-Russian space linkup? How do you reduce an abstract concept like separation of church and state to the size of a postage stamp? If you can get a social problem on a stamp, will anyone buy it? Take CPAs, not notorious for color or sex appeal. Artist <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> created a stunning design last year of an ink penpoint diagonally intersecting the corner of a ledger sheet. Clever. Pretty. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> is one of hundreds of artists who design stamps. The advisory committee has four design coordinators _ one is art director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> _ who farm out an approved proposal to three or so artists. The winner gets an average of $ 3,000. This is peanuts compared to what a duck stamp designer can get. The post office atones for its parsimony by giving the artist what all need and few get, publicity. Leafing through the post office guide to its stamps is an amble through changing times. A Confederate did n't make the postage until 1936 when <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stonewall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> showed up on a 4-center. A 20-cent postal rider in 1869 was the first non-president besides <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> who was famous if for nothing else by making a profit as colonial postmaster. The rider's horse was the first non-human. When <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, the first foreigner, landed upside down by printing error in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> in an 1869 issue, the 14-cent stamp became an instant rarity now worth some $ 145,000. The famous inverted <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> on an airmail stamp of 1918 now fetches some $ 114,999.76 more than its 24-cent face value. Queen <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON>, who sent <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> over here, was the first woman -LRB- 1893 -RRB-; an unnamed chief the first Indian -LRB- 1923 -RRB-; <PERSON> Booker </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> the first black -LRB- 1940 -RRB-. Because perfection is a goal and not a commonplace reality, even among printers, airplanes can always land upside down on a stamp, to the delight of collectors and the embarrassment of the post office. There was an engraver who etched an infinitesimal Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON> in the beard of a 1986 stamp of <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Revel </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> Yeshiva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but he got into a lot of trouble for it. Once a stamp has been designed and approved, it goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> and Engraving. It can come out in rolls, booklets or panels, all glued by an adhesive that must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. -LRB- The post office is working on a new stickum -RRB-. Although it takes up to three years to get a stamp to market, there's no telling if it will take a licking. `` If the public does n't like a stamp, we know about it,'' <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON> says. Many people just take what's handed them, but the more discriminatory _ favorites are history and color _ take pen in hand and write, stamped, to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to express displeasure. The post office does market surveys, but there's no sure thing in stamps. There was a 1984 Christmas stamp of a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> drawn by a schoolboy, winner of a nationwide competition among young pupils. Cute as it was, it bombed. `` We wo n't be doing that again,'' says <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON>. Less certain is what the post office is going to do about <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>. He's been officially dead, despite alleged sightings of a postmortem road show, for more than the requisite decade. He certainly was an American. And his fandom is clamoring for a Presley stamp. A radio station in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> got 10,000 signatures on a petition <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON> figures he's been on at least 100 radio stations to discuss postalizing the rock hero. The advisory committee, of course, will not be lobbied. <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON>, their spokesman, firmly bars the door to the committee room. `` Some people have trouble with the way he died,'' he says tactfully. And to those who have trouble even believing that <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> is dead it can only be reported that the man whose hips set a nation twisting is, like 30,000 or so of his fellow citizens, national monuments and assorted memorabilia, `` under consideration.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Four decades and one sexual revolution ago, the first <LOCATION> Kinsey </LOCATION> report on sexual behavior burst on a startled <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public. Neither the findings nor the language in which it was presented would raise many eyebrows today. Meantime the <ORGANIZATION> Kinsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> carries on, amid some internal controversy about aims and purposes.

 Fifty years ago, amid the limestone bastions and gargoyled turrets of <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a most unlikely man with a bow tie and a crew cut began a most unlikely study _ what goes on behind the bedroom door. Ten years later he published the first of two books on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sexual behavior that shook the American public to its primal roots and inventoried everything from infidelity to masturbation. In retrospect, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON> was well suited to bring sexual behavior out of the confessional in dispassionate scientific terms: quiet, unassuming, straight, trustworthy, dedicated, a father of four, a man of specifics, an expert, for instance, in every aspect of the gall wasp. In 1938, he was asked by a women students' organization to give a course on love and marriage At the library he was dismayed to discover the lack of valid information, a sign of the inhibited times. So he began gathering data himself, interviewing colleagues, students, even the campus police. People confided in him. His reports startled the American people and evoked attacks from church groups, statisticians and sociologists. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> attacked him as a `` real menace to society,'' the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Bulletin killed its own reporter's story. Newspapers from the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Raleigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, from the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> to the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> either refused to print or edited out offending passages. In a day when newspapers did not use the words rape or syphillis, the idea of using explicit references to sexual activities was unthinkable. <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON> said that if the laws of the land were strictly enforced, half of all white <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> males would be in jail as sex offenders; between 50 and 85 percent of males engage in extramarital sex; by the age of 40, nearly 40 percent of single males have engaged in some homosexual activity although they are not homosexuals. The 1953 book on women found that 10 percent of married women never reach climax, but 14 percent of women have multiple orgasms, up to 20 an hour. Fifty percent of women have had premarital sex and 26 percent of married women had extramarital sex. <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> today is headed by a woman, Dr. <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Machover </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON>, who once took dance lessons to become the <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdon </PERSON> of her generation, sang with a group called the Seagulls, learned to sky dive, earned a pilot's license, helped manage the romantic soul duo Peaches and <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> and the rock group Sly and the Family Stone. Later she turned to the study of psychology and, at age 38, an associate professor at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION>, she was offered the <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON> job. She renamed the center the <ORGANIZATION> Kinsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in Sex, Gender and Reproduction, thereby redefining the goals of the institute. `` If we could get back to biology, we'd find that the differences between the sexes are quite small,'' she once told an interviewer. `` I believe that many of the biological propensities are related to sensation and perception _ how we see things, how we experience them Life is a continual interraction ... Eventually, some of the original differences are highly magnified by experience and by complicated interactions between organism and environment, while others are distorted beyond recognition or completely ignored.'' She also began a thrice-weekly column that appears in some 80 to 100 newspapers, answering questions about sex and reproduction. She has named to the board of trustees <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendin </PERSON>, senior vice president and editorial director of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>, president of The Ultimate Experience of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which plans to open a new restaurant in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>. She is the wife of comedian <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>. Obviously, they were not named to the board for their expertise in sex research. <PERSON> Hendin </PERSON> is publisher of the columns, which is both a source of income and has been called an extension of the Kinsey Reports in modern dress. <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> has a knack for raising money. She says she raised $ 250,000 in her last project for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suicide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and plans to have her first fund-raiser for <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON> in the spring. For all of this, <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> has stirred up a considerable furor, which some say threatens her job and the reputation of the institute. Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gebhard </PERSON>, the former director who remained past retirement as director emeritus and consultant, resigned Sept. 13 with a pointed letter to <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON>. `` I have become increasingly disappointed in recent years with the management of the institute,'' he wrote. He congratulated her on increasing the space the institute occupies in the University's <ORGANIZATION> Morrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> and on remodeling the premises But he was critical of what he saw as neglect of the institute's library, which has been called the world's second-largest repository of sexual publications, erotica and pornography, the largest being in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> He complained that the library staff had been cut, threatening its value as an up-to-date resource for scientists and clinicians. `` Frankly, it pains me to see journal subscriptions cut and other austerity measures taken in the library while money is spent on carpets, drapes, brass lighting fixtures and similar non-essentials.''

 <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON>'s assistant director, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, says the only money spent on remodeling was earmarked for that purpose by the university. <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> herself says she spent twice as much in 1987 on the library staff as <PERSON> Gebhard </PERSON> did in his last year and more than four times as much on library acquisitions. She says the remodeling goes in part to save the library where materials were endangered by water leaks. Climate-controlled areas are being readied for the library volumes, and a gallery is being set up for three-dimensional art. Secondly, <PERSON> Gebhard </PERSON> complained, `` in the past six years the institute has produced very little research.'' He added: `` I had hoped that you would attract several competent sex researchers as institute members or affiliates to undertake various projects under the aegis of the institute ... Lastly you somehow missed the one major area of funding for sex research. When the federal government was seeking grant proposals for survey research connected with AIDS, numerous applications were received, but I am told none came from the <ORGANIZATION> Kinsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> ... the very institute which became famous for its many survey research projects.'' <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> has pointed out that she serves on an advisory panel for a national survey, going to 50,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> households, to better define the AIDS problem, and has applied for grants to study pregnant women and their offspring through the first year and a half of life. Her aims are more toward the biological. Her studies, including one she had begun earlier involving 9,000 pregnancies and their issue in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, seek to establish a link between whatever barbituates and hormones the pregnant women took and the sexual orientation and gender of their children. In addition, her researchers interviewed a group of lesbians and among other findings discovered that many of them continued to have heterosexual relations in spite of their self-labels. That led <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> to suggest that early AIDS research may have been based on faulty history-taking which could have minimized the AIDS transmission by heterosexuals. <PERSON> Gebhard </PERSON> did n't think much of those projects and with his resignation severed `` any and all connections with the institute.'' Earlier <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> had asked for and received one year's extension on a regular five-year university review, the release of which is now imminent. And over the past year the institute received a spate of anonymous letters <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> characterized as vicious and critical of her stewardship. In mid-year came the abrupt departure of the last three people on the library staff, reassigned at their request to other campus libraries. That sharply limited the institute library's availability to scholars, all 64,000 volumes, 3,500 three-dimensional objects and 25,000 pieces of flat art, Japanese, Indian, Persian and Western drawings and paintings. Beyond that the library houses pornographic material from cartoons to stag films, fetish objects, prison art, condoms, letters, diaries, photographs, the fantasies of generations. Current periodicals stack up with no one to file them. What exactly is behind the unrest is unclear. Some say differences in style and some say shortcomings in substance. There is no question that there are differences in style. <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON>, who poured every cent of profit from his studies back into the institute -LRB- each hard cover copy of his books yielded a dollar in royalties, a total of perhaps $ 500,000 -RRB- and who pressed his people to work on Saturdays without overtime, would be considered old-fashioned in his approach today. When <PERSON> Gebhard </PERSON> first moved in -LRB- in 1946 -RRB- he had to share a room with <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON>'s gall wasp specimens, piled in boxes nearly floor-to-ceiling. <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON> was not a fund-raiser. He abhorred the socializing necessary. What money became available went into expanding the research base and adding to the collection. <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON> was a conservative in every aspect of life except sex research. He survived <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> investigations in the communist-hunting <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> era even when the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, mindful of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee investigation that sought to show that philanthropic organizations were encouraging research by communists, cut off further grants to <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON>'s institute. In 1957, <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON>, with the university behind him, faced down <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs in the courts over an attempt to stop the import of erotic materials for research purposes. He did not live to see the landmark decision. He died in 1956 at the age of 62. <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON>'s aim was to build up a reservoir of at least 100,000 personal sex histories. There were some 18,000 when he quit, the source material for the major studies on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sexual behavior, and, he hoped, for future studies as well. His notion was to have a large enough statistical base so that researchers could dip in at will to retrieve what they needed for any given study. Since <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON>, Masters and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and others have taken the sex act into the laboratory, measuring scientifically everything from the physiology of the orgasm to the nature of impotency. Books like <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Comfort </PERSON>'s `` The Joy of Sex'' are best sellers. Both <PERSON> Gebhard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> had plans to go back to <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON>'s original subjects and see how things had changed in the past 50 years It was just too expensive, everyone seems to agree. But the subjects are still out there, <PERSON> Gebhard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> agree, between 50 and 80 years of age. <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> says those she met thought that being interviewed by <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON> was one of the greatest experiences in their lives. `` Afterward they felt better about themselves.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Despite what most people think, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> recently cited the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> subway system as the most improved system on the continent and the man in charge received the manager of the year award.

 Tune in `` The Equalizer'' and see a young girl stalked by an attacker in a shadowy subway stop. Watch `` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>'' chase a suspect through a crowded train, or a video dancer paint the name of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s album `` Bad'' on the wall of a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> station. These images of the subway as a filthy bastion of thugs are powerful. Only 25 percent of Americans surveyed thought the subways are safe, and only one in three said they would use the underground when visiting <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But the subway is getting a bad rap, according to <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> officials. They say determined management and a $ 12 billion capital improvement program have resulted in a major success story of the 1980s _ the rebirth of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> subway system as a relatively reliable, clean and safe mode of transportation. `` The turnaround and the elimination of graffiti from the subway system has been near miraculous,'' says Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. Officials say subway reliability is five times better than it was five years ago. Today 94 percent of all cars are clean and free of graffiti. And less than 3 percent of the city's crimes occur in the subway, which is used by 3.6 million people daily. Plenty of problems remain. Derailments are up after a four-year decline. The homeless use the subways as dormitories. Beggars harass passengers. And thieves jam turnstiles and steal tokens. And New Yorkers _ half of whom ride the subways daily _ remain skeptical. A <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> survey found they believe serious crimes occur in the subway twice as often as they actually do. Some notorious crimes have fueled that fear: <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> gunned down four teen-agers; a violinist's hand was severed when she was pushed in front of a subway. But there is no disputing that the system's decline has finally been stemmed. Gleaming new stainless steel cars and sturdy rehabilitated ones painted proud red are rolling across 230 miles of track that gradually is being replaced. The most noticeable change is the eradication of graffiti. Four years ago, there was not a single subway car in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that was not scarred with spray paint. Graffiti was in vogue at the time and was considered, in some circles, an art form. Transit Authority President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> declared war on graffiti, ordering cars be cleaned one at a time. If a clean car was sprayed again, it was removed from service and recleaned. He frustrated legions of teen-aged spray painters proud of their rolling `` canvases.'' <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> is proud of the accomplishment. He likes to tell of a recent meeting between <LOCATION> TA </LOCATION> officials, the mayor's liaison with the movie and television industry and a group of major producers who wanted to deface subway cars for filming purposes. `` I said, ` No.' They said, ` What do you mean, no?' And I said, ` I mean no.' And the car department people were cheering me on,'' <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> says. `` They said they'd use water colors to mark up the trains and re-create graffiti and clean up afterward. But we are not going to let them go in and mark up trains _ re-create the nightmare. `` If there is a graffitied train, they can use it. I ca n't stop them from taking a picture. If they want to get footage of dirty subway cars, they'd better hurry up because they are n't going to be around much longer.'' Not everyone is convinced that <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>'s approach is best. `` He still firmly believes in the cosmetics rather than the reality of the system,'' says <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` He extended the preventative maintenance of the buses from every 4,000 miles to 8,000 miles, but he wo n't let a bus go out if it has gum on the floor, even if that means a gap in service.'' Still, the turnaround has made an impression on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group representing managers of transit systems in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. At a recent meeting in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, the TA was cited as the most improved system on the continent and <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> received the manager of the year award. `` The graffiti that had become the TA's international identification mark has been nearly eliminated,'' says <ORGANIZATION> APTA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Reba </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, a board member of <ORGANIZATION> VIA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` The industry looks with pride at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>.'' But getting the message to the public has proved more difficult. The TA now is using sophisticated market research and slick advertising to change public perceptions. `` The image of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> transit system is outdated across the nation,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>, director of marketing for the <ORGANIZATION> TA </ORGANIZATION>'s parent agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. `` But there is no national advertising for the same reason that there is no citywide advertising ... We're not ready to advertise.'' Although the system is open 24 hours a day and serves a huge territory from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Rockaways </LOCATION>, not all lines have been rehabilitated. One recent ad campaign promoted six of the system's 26 lines, three on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s East Side and three on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> that are consistently rated the best by straphangers. The ads urged business riders to use the subways during midday hours as a speedy alternative to a taxi stalled in traffic. The $ 1 million ad campaign was developed at the mayor's request to try to ease midtown traffic and air pollution. The <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> considers it money well spent. Some positive exposure is free. <PERSON> Michelob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> beers both chose the TA's sleek, stainless steel subways cars as settings for their television commercials. The Style section of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and Women's Wear Daily, a fashion trade publication, published this tip: It's hip to ride the subways. And <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, one of the major underwriters of <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> bonds, produced a glitzy marketing video for potential bond buyers that glowingly outlines the progress made, most of it financed by the sale of bonds. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> `` would n't have touched us with a 10-foot pole five years ago,'' <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> says.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> oversees the largest subway system in the world with the enthusiam of a boy playing with a newa n't get everything, especially Japanese food and fashionable clothes.'' <PERSON> Itoh </PERSON> marvels at the size of American-grown vegetables, but does n't understand the popularity of hamburgers and fast food. He follows <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politics but wonders, `` Can you tell a Democrat from a Republican?.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is super, other than its fast food,'' <PERSON> Itoh </PERSON> says. `` When I brought my daughter home from three weeks at summer camp with no Japanese food, I promised her a trip to the best sushi restaurant in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. She said, ` No, Daddy, I want a hamburger and a <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>.''' Loneliness can be a problem for people like <PERSON> Katsuhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawasoe </PERSON>, 51, a <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Star </ORGANIZATION> executive whose wife and children remained in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Sure I miss them,'' <PERSON> Kawasoe </PERSON> says. `` But for the time being, there are many things to do at work and I play a lot of golf. It's completely different kind of golf course here It's so flat, and it's much cheaper than in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' The Japanese find the American educational system much less demanding than their own. They worry their children will fall behind upon returning home. To shore up perceived weaknesses in the American system, the state has been spending $ 120,000 a year since 1986 to pay for a special school at <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, operated by the Rev. <PERSON> Nobukaza </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, 45. Every Saturday, 73 Japanese in grades one through nine are tutored in Japanese language and culture, mathematics, and social studies. `` We focus on the Japanese language because we're afraid the students might forget their Japanese writing, reading and speaking skills,'' <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> says. `` After three years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, quite a large number of young people struggle with the language when they return to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' Diamond-Star also hired <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Imahori </PERSON>, 32, an assistant professor of communications at <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, to train both its Japanese and American workers. Japanese workers are schooled on body language, told to avoid crossing their arms during conversations and avoid certain hand gestures considered offensive in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. American workers are taught how to understand English spoken with a heavy Japanese accent, to interpret common Japanese gestures and the different Japanese work ethic. Imahori teaches the Japanese workers about American work habits and attitudes, which are geared toward individual achievement and reward rather than the group-oriented goals common in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, if a worker gets behind he voluntarily stays late to catch up. Here, workers go home at 5 p.m. whether the work is done or not,'' he says. `` Then there are the family concerns of American workers, which must be taken into consideration, and holidays. Religious holidays do not exist in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' Besides institutional help provided by schools and the company, intergration into <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> life has occurred naturally with the opening of <PERSON> Kiku </PERSON>, a sushi restaurant, and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oriental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mart </ORGANIZATION>. The mart specializes in food for Asians and natives of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>: spices, canned goods, hugh sacks of rice, frozen fish, vegetables and all sorts of imported delicacies. It was opened in April by four Filipino women who came to the area to work as quality-control inspectors at a local power plant construction project in the 1970s. They stayed in the twin-cities area, Bloomington-Normal, when the job was finished and became naturalized Americans. `` There was a need for an Oriental store in the twin cities and we were having a hard time finding jobs so we opened the store,'' says <PERSON> Laurita </PERSON> <PERSON> Walaskay </PERSON>, one of the owners. There are other signs the two cultural opposites are starting to mix. The end of each tour of duty by a Japanese technician prompts a party at a local bar with their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> co-workers. `` We hate to see them go,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> says. `` We all get along. There's a mutual respect. And we go out and drink beer together. I enjoy them and I'm looking forward to training in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ With its jails already overflowing and arrests increasing, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has been scrambling to find places to house its prisoners. One solution has been to build new jails and in some cases this has meant transporting inmates hundreds of miles.

 Thieves, drug-pushers and other hoodlums from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> arrive in this scenic vacation land aboard chartered jets. They stay in brand-new accommodations, savoring the bucolic charm of the shore of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, more than 300 miles from the Big Apple. They come to go to jail. They are men like 37-year-old <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, who says he has been in and out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Riker </PERSON>'s Island jail so many times he has lost count. `` I'm not pleased about being so far away from home, but compared to <PERSON> Riker </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, this place is all right,'' says <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, who was sentenced this time to one year in jail for illegal possession of stolen credit cards. <PERSON> Cape </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is now the home of <ORGANIZATION> Riverview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION>, a 700-bed jail that was built in less than a year to house criminals from this country's largest city. An identical jail was was also built by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ogdensburg </LOCATION>, about 40 miles to the north. Both opened in August and were filled in a month. `` I do n't know what we would have done without the upstate jails. They opened up just in time,'' says <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Antenan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s jail population has surged to more than 17,000 inmates, largely because of beefed-up drug enforcement, <PERSON> Antenan </PERSON> says. He says the city is building more jails in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and is considering buying more barges to board prisoners and adding more cells at <PERSON> Riker </PERSON>'s Island. The city spent $ 110 million to build the jails and will pay $ 40 million a year to operate them under a 10-year contract with the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Radley </PERSON>, a town supervisor in this community of 1,800, says the jail is providing jobs and should lead to more development, maybe even a drug store or another gas station. `` We've been losing our young people because there's nothing for them to do here,'' <PERSON> Radley </PERSON> says. `` Working in the prison is a respectable job that hopefully will keep our young people from leaving.'' Critics of the jail, which is located on a main road near a high school and a state park, included <PERSON> Radley </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, who runs a trailer park. He and others were afraid it would hurt business. `` I was n't too happy with the idea when it started,'' says <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and six other state parks along the river. `` But now I just hope, once they put some trees in and do some landscaping, that it will just be a forgotten thing.'' He says that judging from reactions during the construction of the prison this summer, the fears that a prison would drive away tourists probably were unfounded. `` People see it as an attraction, just another thing to come and look at when they're tired of sitting by the river,'' <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> says. Some worry that the prison will change the homey atmosphere of the community, where car keys are left in ignitions, bicycles are not locked in garages and people are friendly. `` This is really hometown <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Thousand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the prison is going to change things, we hope whatever happens is positive.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> says there has been little reaction among the high school students, even though students pass the facility's fences on the bus twice a day. Inside those fences, guards proudly show off the new washing machines, the gleaming wood floor in the gymnasium and the walk-in freezers in the cafeteria. Inmates talk about how good the food is, how professional the guards are and how the toughest adjustment may be getting accustomed to only being able to watch three channels on television. Inmate <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> says that when he stepped off the plane and looked around he forgot about the whispers onboard of the trip being a bluff, especially when he saw the shotgun-armed guards greeting him as he stepped through the doorway. `` I did n't know where I was, but I knew wherever it was, we were n't welcome,'' he said. That's the first signal to the prisoners that this jail is not <PERSON> Riker </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>. `` Most of them are pretty scared when they first look out,'' says prison guard <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Leconey </PERSON>. `` Especially when they see us standing with the shotguns. Usually it takes a few weeks before they get the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> attitude back in them.'' End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 11

 Although <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> learned comedy on her father's knee across from <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, she was frequently cast as an ice princess. `` Look, I was never an obvious choice for comedy,'' she says. Now she has her chance. She stars as a television newswoman in the new CBS series `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>.'' `` What I love about <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> is that she's a character part,'' <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> says. `` She's not a straight leading lady. She has these edges. She's testy, she has her frailties.'' The role was not written for <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> and CBS initially resisted casting her, yet she has taken to it as though she was born to play comedy. Which she may have been, being the daughter of ventriloquist <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> and being raised in the same household with <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> <PERSON> Snerd </PERSON>. `` My father was this very private, very reserved man who expressed this very trenchant and often bawdy humor through <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>,'' she says. `` He said things through <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> he could never say otherwise. I grew up around magic tricks and learning to throw my voice. He and I would sit together and read cartoons from the New Yorker and he'd ask me why each one was funny. `` I never had much chance to play comedy in films. I was always cast as the ice princess. I think of my father a lot because we were very much alike. Our humor is the same. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> is similar to <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> in that she's fairly fearless and sassy.'' <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> told of her growing up with <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> in her best-selling 1984 biography `` Knock Wood.'' `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'' is <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION>'s first venture into series television, and it appears to be a good start. She plays an anchorwoman on a television magazine show called `` FYI.'' She fits perfectly into the character, who is the kind of person whose motor is always running. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> is a little overwhelming, and certainly larger than life. She's talented, bright and sophisticated, yet ultimately vulnerable. <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> takes chances with the role, as when she bursts into an off-key rendition of a Motown tune. It's the kind of thing that could make an actress look foolish, but she uses it as an opportunity to reveal <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s human side. `` It's great to have a role you can do something with week after week,'' she says. `` Our characters just keep growing and expanding. That's a luxury I've never had before. The more I play <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> the more possibilities I find.'' Her character also breaks new ground on television. The series opened with <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> just out of the <ORGANIZATION> Betty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, where she had gone for alcohol addiction. She also gave up smoking during her stay. It makes the point that people can kick addictions and function well afterward. <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> notes with some irony that 15 years after she was offered a job as a correspondent on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes,'' she is now playing a fictional counterpart. `` I love being a journalist,'' she says. `` I've loved and followed journalism for years, and have done some myself, so I do n't have to research the role I did a photojournalism series for ` The Today Show.' So it's great to be doing a show with the texture of network journalism. It's a very savvy show.'' Her articles and photos have also appeared in a number of magazines, and in the 1982 movie `` Gandhi'' she was an obvious choice to play <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> photojournalist <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourke-White </PERSON>. In recent years <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION>'s career has shifted toward TV movies and miniseries. It's the kind of career move forced upon many performers after they pass 40 because of the movies' preoccupation with youth. She was in the miniseries `` Hollywood Wives'' and such movies as `` Murder: By Reason of Insanity,'' `` Arthur the King'' and `` Mayflower Madam.'' <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON>, who's married to French director <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Malle </PERSON>, took time off for the birth of her daughter, <PERSON> Chloe </PERSON>, three years ago. She's only recently returned to work Although she studied art history and writing at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, it seemed inevitable she would go into the family business. Her cool, blonde, Nordic beauty landed her modeling assignments while still in college. She made her film debut in 1965 in `` The Group,'' director <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumet </PERSON>'s adaptation of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s brittle soap opera tracing the graduates of one of the Seven Sisters colleges. Frequently she was cast in what she calls `` ice princess'' roles, as in `` Carnal Knowledge,'' `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>'s Story,'' and the TV movie `` Mayflower Madam.'' Only rarely was she cast in comedies, such as `` Starting Over'' and `` Rich and Famous.'' Two of her best roles were in ephe was <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>'s love interest in `` The Sand Pebbles,'' in which she played an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman caught between feuding Chinese warlords in 1926. <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON> was a cynical saic adventures. Silor aboard the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> gunboat USS <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pablo </LOCATION> who comes to her rescue. In `` The Wind and the Lion'' she was an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman kidnapped by a Moroccan sheik played by <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> at his swashbuckling best.

 Long before there was Mrs. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> of `` Diff ` rent Strokes'' and `` The Facts of Life,'' there was Mrs. <PERSON> Peachum </PERSON> in `` The Threepenny Opera'' and <PERSON> Mammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yokum </PERSON> in `` Li' l Abner'' and even Mistress Quickly in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, Parts 1 and 2 <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON>, actress, singer and comedian, had a thriving theater career in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for more than 20 years before she made her way west to television land. Now she has returned to the theater, touring the country in `` Into the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,'' the <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim-James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapine </PERSON> fairy tale musical that goes beyond `` happily ever after.'' Miss <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> and British singer <PERSON> Cleo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laine </PERSON> are the best-known members of the large ensemble cast. In the show, Miss <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s mother _ of beanstalk fame. It's a small role _ different and darker than what most people remember from the original fairy story. `` People who know me only from television, from Mrs. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, they wo n't believe it's me,'' the actress says. `` I saw this play last spring on Broadway, and it blew me away. I was dissolved in tears. The music was so exquisite. `` When this opportunity came along to play a small part in a Sondheim-Lapine musical, I just said to myself, ` Oh, God, will you give me permission? Can I do it?''' He apparently said `` yes,'' because after auditioning for <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lapine </PERSON> _ she sang the first act finale from `` The Threepenny Opera'' and `` Lonely Town'' from <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>'s `` On the Town'' _ Miss <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> got the part. `` The hardest thing is trying to learn it all in two weeks before you open,'' she says. `` It's a true work of art. It's not just a little jazzy piece. Once you've mastered some of it, you are so thrilled. I love being bathed in that sound and just being one of the singers.'' Miss <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> did n't start out to be a singer. She had intentions of becoming a serious actress and went to <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to major in speech. In her sophomore year, she was waylaid by the Waa-Mu Show, an annual spring musical starring students at the school. `` I ended up doing all the sketches and a song by <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnick </PERSON> who later wrote ` Fiddler on the Roof,''' she says. `` That certainly widened my range.'' When Miss <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> graduated, she went straight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with all her theater chums, including <PERSON> Harnick </PERSON> and comedian <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynde </PERSON>. She rarely was unemployed, landing roles in many important productions, including the legendary and long-running off-Broadway revival of `` The Threepenny Opera.'' Miss <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> developed a reputation as a zany singer with a fine sense of timing, a skill she honed during her stage career in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. That work encompassed musicals like `` Li' l <PERSON> Abner </PERSON>,'' `` Pickwick'' and `` Three Wishes for <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>,'' and more serious fare like <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Papp </PERSON>'s Shakespeare festival in Central Park. `` Composers, artists, actors, singers, all of them, I think, unconsciously learn from others,'' she says. `` I'm sure it's not conscious, but they ca n't help it. I know I was influenced by <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON>. I must have been.'' Eventually she and her family decided to head for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` My former husband wanted to move to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' Miss <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> says. `` He is a music editor and music coordinator. He coordinated the music for the film version of ` Amadeus.' `` So many people have moved there from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and I felt at home.'' Miss <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> found steady work in television, jobs that led to a recurring role as the housekeeper on `` Diff ` rent Strokes'' and then graduating to headmistress of a girls school on its spinoff, `` The Facts of Life Her constant employment in television lasted some 10 years before she decided she had had enough. `` I wanted to move on and I needed some time for the rest of my life,'' Miss <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> says. `` I needed time for my family, myself, my friends. `` Television does devour you because you have all sorts of responsibilities, and I really needed to renew myself,'' she adds. `` I think I owed it to myself. So I honored myself _ and quit. I think that's a wonderful way to put it.'' Now Miss <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> has formed a production company to create projects that will give her opportunities to play roles far removed from Mrs. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> and `` The Facts of Life.'' She's also working on a one-woman stage show and is interested in re-issuing an album of theater songs she recorded in the 1950s. Called `` Songs I Taught My Mother,'' the recording includes rare material by writers such as <PERSON> Harnick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Blitzstein </PERSON>. `` The songs are all a little on the naughty side but they are fun because nothing is naughty today,'' she says with a laugh. For the moment, Miss <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> will have `` Into the Woods'' to keep her occupied. But since leaving her television series, she also has become involved with an international group called <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. It promotes the exchange of visitors between different countries, and Miss <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> is their spokeswoman. `` The whole idea is that we are ambassadors of peace on a personal basis,'' she says. `` We try to understand each other, and we have developed such a bond. The more people who join, the less chance there is for conflict if we understand each other. `` If all goes well, I'm going to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> next year and stay with a family in a small town. I ca n't wait.''

 A volcanic dot 1,000 miles out in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the island-nation of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> is in the midst of an economic boom. What is being called the `` <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> Miracle'' has turned a backward economy around so drastically that now nearly everybody works, money is flowing in and ethnic tensions have eased, at least for now. An AP correspondent who visited the island tells how it all came about.

 Just six years ago its sugar-dominated economy was reeling and 22 percent of its work force was unemployed, but today this island nation is an economic tiger in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Like the nearly suicidal taxi drivers on its narrow roads, <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> has hurtled from Third World low-income economic status to a middle-income nation where practically everybody has a job and the money is pouring in from tourists flocking to its beaches and new industry implanted by foreign investment, chiefly from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Some call it the `` <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> Miracle,'' but the prime minister, Sir <PERSON> Aneerood </PERSON> <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON>, wo n't have it. `` There is no miracle,'' he said. `` It is due simply to hard work, discipline and will.'' _ Real growth has averaged 7 percent since 1983, largely as a result of the foreign investiment aggressively sought by the government _ Unemployment has declined to just under 4 percent, virtual full employment, with jobs in some sectors going begging From 1985 to 1987, 20,000 new jobs were created each year in manufacturing alone among the island's 1 million people and it has replaced sugar as the main industry. _ Annual per capita income is estimated at $ 2,000 _ up from $ 1,000 six years ago _ on the 720-square-mile, pear-shaped volcanic island 500 miles east of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> and 1,000 miles east of the African mainland _ Earnings from tourists drawn to <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>' beaches doubled during the same period, and excellent sugar harvests have further fueled the boom The chief opposition leader, <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Nababsing </PERSON>, acknowledges: `` It is a fact that there has been great progress. We have had a good program from the government side on investments.'' <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON>, in an interview, cautioned, however, that the success could disappear as quickly as it came `` and that is why I always call upon our people to be reasonable, to be fair and not to think that we have already achieved success for eternity.'' The government is working on setting up an offshore banking center and stock exchange. It hopes to replace <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a regional center for international companies and to become a stepping stone for <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> firms interested in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The growth rate has already begun to slow down, which is just what the country needs, said Finance Minister <PERSON> Vishnu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutchmerenaidoo </PERSON>. He said `` inflation is soaring,'' rising from less than 1 percent to 15 percent in the past year, and the country is seriously short of skilled labor. Slower growth will give <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> time to work on curbing pollution, improving the quality of life and training workers for more specialized jobs. The goal is to shift from the manufacture of knitted woolen garments, its chief export, to electronics and other higher-price items. A quality-of-life department has been set up, financed by liquor and cigarette taxes, and it plans exercise and health-food campaigns and a nationwide anti-smoking program. Large amounts will be spent on environmental programs. `` We are very much aware that if the present growth rate is maintained and corrective measures are not taken we are heading toward a dirty <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>, a rich and dirty <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>,'' said Finance Minister <PERSON> Lutchmerenaidoo </PERSON>. There's much to save. Graceful mountains rise dramatically above the cane fields, appearing higher than their altitudes. Piton de la Rivere Noire is the highest at 2,711 feet. <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> pagodas, Hindu shivalas, Tamil temples, Moslem mosques and Christian cathedrals dot the landscape on an island that <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> said `` was created before paradise came into being and served as a model for the latter.'' But slowing down the economy further is n't easy, <PERSON> Lutchmeenaraidoo </PERSON> said. Investment is continuing _ more than 1,500 hotel rooms are under construction and the government recently approved a 15-percent increase in the minimum wage to $ 10.35 a week for employees working in manufacturing. However, with labor in demand most workers are paid far above the minimum. `` We're buying social peace,'' <PERSON> Lutchmerenaidoo </PERSON> said. `` If people do n't believe in what you are doing they wo n't follow you.'' There is no sign of complacency among government officials or businessmen. `` We can not afford to sit on our backsides,'' said <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> Export Processing Zone. Speaking to a group of African businessmen and women at a seminar on the <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> economic boom, she said protectionism and competition from other developing countries meant there was no time for relaxing. Delegates from half a dozen East African countries were clearly impressed, several noting their governments had endorsed similar export efforts but done nothing. <PERSON> Ondiek </PERSON> <PERSON> Okelo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said, `` This is where it has happened. This is a great success story. We've have been very impressed.''

 Export manager <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, asked by delegates if the government consults with industry before levying new taxes, responded: `` Of course. They come to us to talk and if they are proposing taxes that are too high, we say you are going to blow up the economy and you will be kicked out of government.'' The export zone's more than 500 businesses employ more than 90,000 people. This courtship of government and industry began after the 1982 elections, which themselves serve as a guide to <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>. Jokes were made during that election about the economy being as dead as the Dodo bird, which became extinct after Dutch hunters here wiped them out several centuries ago. An alliance led by the <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON>'s Mauritian <ORGANIZATION> Militant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- MMM -RRB- defeated the pro-Western government, taking all 60 elected seats. But <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON>'s government immediately began implementing the suggestions of Western creditors. While <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON>'s government was slashing corporate taxes and removing duties on many items to entice investors in the export zone, the island also benefited from an improved world economy, lower petroleum prices and an absence of cyclones during the sugar season. But most important was a big influx of money from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and other Asian nations. Some of these countries had already reached their export quotas with Western nations and shifted production to <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON> was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> MMM </ORGANIZATION> leadership and forced to form his own party a year after winning the election. His new party, the <ORGANIZATION> Mauritian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, has led an alliance that has won two subsequent elections. <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON>'s alliance controls two-thirds of the seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, although it won only 9,512 votes more than the opposition in last year's election in which 89 percent of the electorate cast ballots. In <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> terms, this is political stability and both opposition leader <PERSON> Nababsing </PERSON>, who is with the <ORGANIZATION> MMM </ORGANIZATION>, and Finance Minister <PERSON> Lutchmeenaraido </PERSON> credit it with a big role in the country's economic development `` I do n't see any other party changing what we are doing,'' said <PERSON> Lutchmeenaraido </PERSON>. Rather than proposing major changes in the liberal economic reforms, <PERSON> Nababsing </PERSON> says, it was his party, the former party of the prime minister, that initiated them. <PERSON> Nababsing </PERSON> does criticize the government, saying it has been too slow to diversify, and that growth is slowing, inflation is out of control and more attention needs to be paid to avoiding ethnic divisions. Since independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1968, governments have been careful to avoid fanning ethnic divisions among various groups in the Hindu majority or other groups. Two-thirds of the population are Hindus, many of them descendants of indentured laborers brought here by the British to work the sugar planations. About 28 percent are Creoles, descendants of Africans and Europeans or Africans and Asians. About 3 percent are of Chinese descent and the rest descendants of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> or other European stock. English is the official language but <PERSON> Creole </PERSON>, a mixture of French and other languages, along with French are spoken by the vast majority. Road signs are in English but advertisements and newspapers are in French. French and <PERSON> Creole </PERSON> had already been entrenched before the English captured the island from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the 19th century. Before the French, the Dutch occupied the island from 1598 to 1710.

 Prime Minister Sir <PERSON> Aneerood </PERSON> <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON> has surprised all those _ both friends and foes _ who viewed him as just a figurehead when he took office six years ago. Far from resting on the ceremony of his office, <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON> has presided over an unprecedented economic boom for his island nation, surmounted several politicial crises and scandals, and narrowly escaped assassination Nov. 6. No one sees him as a figurehead now. `` Since 1983 I had to follow a tough line, inculcate discipline at all levels, especially among the working class,'' the 58-yeara-old leader said in an interview. `` I had to assure industrial and social stability. Of course coupled with political stability, which brought in the confidence required on the part of investors to come here.'' He added, `` I must say I have had lots of problems since I started, but I think I have a strength in that I am sincere in what I am doing. I believe that our country has a great future. I have always believed that we are destined to play an important role in this region, especially economically, and I have always had the will to pull on. `` Unlike many other politicians I do n't mind even if I have to take unpopular measures in the interest of the country to do it.'' When he took office, many felt <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON> was chosen solely because he was a Hindu, and Hindus make up two-thirds of the island's 1 million people. Nevertheless, it was during a Hindu religious service Nov. 6 that a <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> priest was disarmed as he held a gun to <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON>'s head. The motives of the alleged assailant, who is facing charges of attempted murder, remain unclear. <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON> said, `` I must tell you that since 1983, wherever I go, I always have the apprehension that something may happen to me some day. I am exposed. The risk is always there. `` But I was a bit shocked because I never thought in the place were I was, surrounded by the kind of people I was surrounded by, in whom I have 100 percent trust, that they would never do anything to harm me and the danger came from that source, from that quarter. This is what shocked me.'' But many Mauritians still see the prime minister as a prime mover. Said Finance Minister <PERSON> Vishnu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutchmeenaraido </PERSON>: `` The world today acknowledges the fact we are a progressive country, wedded to the ideals of democracy and secularism. Much of the credit of the gigantic economic and industrial development of recent times ... goes to the prime minister.''

<NOTE>EDS: One of an AP Spotlight package of three stories.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are some facts and figures on <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>: THE LAND _ The island is almost completely surrounded by a coral reef and several mountains rise dramatically with the highest reaching 2,711 feet. Sugar cane fields cover 87 percent of the arable land. In the southwestern <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, 500 miles east of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> and 1,000 miles off the east coast of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the volcanic island covers 720 square miles, about half the size of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The territory of <LOCATION> Rodgrigues </LOCATION> and other islands under its control brings the total area to 788 square miles.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 HISTORY _ Although visited by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> sailors, the island was uninhabited the Dutch occupied it in 1598 and named it Maurtius after their stadholder, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> claimed the island after the Dutch abandoned their settlement and imported African slaves to work the sugar plantations. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> took the island in 1810, largely to stop attacks by pirates based on the island, and thousands of Indian laborers were brought in to work the fields after slaves were freed. Agitation for political representation began in the 1930s and in 1947 limited self-rule was granted. Progress towards independence was delayed by the opposition of some Creole groups, who feared domination by the Indian majority. In 1968 the island became independent with a conservative Hindu, Sir <PERSON> Seewoosagur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramgoolam </PERSON>, as its first prime minister.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE PEOPLE _ All are immigrants or descendants of immigrants. Two-thirds of the population of 1 million are of Indian descent while 29 percent are Creoles of mixed African and European or Indian and European descent. About 3 percent are of Chinese ancestry and about 36,000 are of European descent, mostly French. About 56 percent belong to various Hindu sects, and about 28 percent are <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, mostly Roman Catholics. About 16 percent are Moslems. English is the official language, but <PERSON> Creole </PERSON>, an admixture of pidgin French and other languages, is the lingua franca.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE ECONOMY _ The economy was almost totally dependent on sugar until an aggressive export-oriented economic program was inititated in 1983. While sugar was king the economy was on a boom or bust cycle. Cyclones and world sugar prices dictated the island's fortunes In recent years, after the implementation of an export program, under which taxes and duties were slashed to encourage investment, manufacturing, particularly of clothes, quickly surpassed sugar. Tourism has become a major money earner.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Oliver and Company,'' ``The Land Before Time''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 G-rated movies have become as scarce as truth in presidential elections, so it is heartening to find two on the holiday bill of fare. Both are animated features. Both can be enjoyed by teen-agers and adults as well as small fry. `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and Company'' is the most fully realized animated film from the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> since `` 101 Dalmatians.'' It is inspired entertainment in all departments: characters, animation, comedy, plot and voices. It should be another perennial for Disney. The story is loosely based on <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' `` Oliver Twist'' _ very loosely. The locale is <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fagin </PERSON> is a nerdish petty crook, not a criminal mastermind. And his youthful charges are a ragtag bunch of dogs, not cockney urchins. The newcomer to the gang is <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, a spunky kitten who failed to get adopted from a street corner carboard box. He is befriended by the roguish Dodger urch officials say Mass would be celebrated in the Church of the Nativity as usual this year, but no decision had been made on whether the Latin patriarch will lead a religious procession in Manger Square. The uprising has left its mark on this half Moslem, half Christian town of 50,000 four miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Shops were closed Monday and streets deserted during a general strike ordered by the underground leadership of the revolt. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers with machine guns patrolled the main highway into town and guarded Manger Square from two rooftop lookout posts. Five soldiers were in the square, eating a lunch of sandwiches and oranges. A few tourist buses were parked to the Church of the Nativity, but as many as 50 at a time squeezed into the square before the uprising. Visitors were taken through the church quickly Monday, then back to the buses, and some were disppointed. `` It's a shame that the shops are closed,'' said <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandak </PERSON>, 56, whose souvenir shop was closed for the strike, said the rebellion had ruined his business. `` In two weeks, I sell one dollar's worth of goods,'' he said. Others in the tourism industry, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s main business, have similar problems. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreiten </PERSON>, manager of the 60-bed Star Hotel, said only four of his rooms were reserved for Christmas. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> hotels are accustomed to full bookings months in advance of Christmas. <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, the deputy mayor, said the town council decided to cancel official celebrations in support of the uprising. No formal vote was taken but the decision was unanimous, he said. Some Christians in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> said they would support the decision and restrain private holiday observances. `` I wo n't have a tree this year and people in my family are not going to exchange presents,'' <PERSON> Kreiten </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think anyone will celebrate.'' <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Elian </PERSON>, a 48-year-old housewife, said: `` I'm not going to bake cookies and sweets. My friend's son is in prison. How could I tell her `` Merry Christmas'' and her son is not at home?'' Her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, disagreed. He said Christians are becoming a beleaguered minority in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> and should assert themselves by celebrating Christmas. `` All year we've had days of sorrow,'' he said. `` We need a day to smile.'' <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s plans for the season were not welcome news to tourists. `` I do n't think it's a good idea,'' said <PERSON> Reinhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Steffen </PERSON>, a 24-year-old West German. `` One should keep the old traditions.''

 Videos Reviewed this week: `` Three Men and a Baby,'' `` <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Pop'' and `` The Seventh Sign.'' `` Three Men and a Baby'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Touchstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 89.95; Rated PG -RRB- There have been far funnier movies in the past couple of years than `` Three Men and a Baby'' but none that have made as much money _ a phenomenal $ 167 million at last count. Any film that successful has to have something going for it. In this case it's one awfully cute baby -LRB- played by 5-month-old twins <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> -RRB- and three awfully cute grown men _ <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> `` Magnum P.I.'' <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> `` Cheers'' <PERSON> Danson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Guttenberg </PERSON> of `` Diner,'' `` Cocoon'' `` Police Academy'' and other movies. In this adaptation of the French comedy `` Three Men and a Cradle,'' the men play well-to-do bachelors whose carefree, romantic life on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> is rudely interrupted by the arrival on their doorstep of a baby girl. It seems <PERSON> Danson </PERSON>, who plays an irresponsible, not-too-bright actor, is the father, and the mother is a struggling actress who temporarily just ca n't cope with both motherhood and a career. At first the guys are horrified, but gradually they learn to bathe the baby, change her diapers, hold her when she cries _ and, finally, to love her and want to keep her. This makes for some good-natured fun, needlessly complicated by a subplot involving drug dealers whose smuggled heroin has been dropped off in the bachelor pad. <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>, whose previous film roles as a romantic swashbuckler left audiences cold, is appealing in a low-key way; <PERSON> Danson </PERSON> is more or less the same egotistical clod he plays on television; <PERSON> Guttenberg </PERSON> comes across as the most genuine of the three. The movie was directed by <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimoy </PERSON>, Mr. <PERSON> Spock </PERSON> of `` Star Trek'' fame. His style is efficient but unimaginative, perhaps in keeping with his television roots. _ By <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Pop'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 89.95; Rated R -RRB- `` <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Pop'' is a fairly routine story of young love, dressed up in punk clothes and shipped off to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Still, it's charming and fun. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> -RRB- yearns to move from backup singer to lead in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s downtown music scene. Down on her luck, she gets a post card from a friend in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, and decides to join her. <PERSON> Hiro </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Yutaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Tadokoro </PERSON> of the Japanese band <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, meanwhile, is a very westernized <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> rocker, singing `` Blue Suede Shoes'' in a band whose members are convinced they will make it big if only they can find a gaijin, or foreigner, to sing with them. You can guess most of the rest of director <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzui </PERSON>'s film, though there are twists along the way to <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s becoming lead singer in <PERSON> Hiro </PERSON>'s band For all its rebellious appearance, `` <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Pop'' is moralistic. There are no drugs, and the characters drink only moderately. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hiro </PERSON> do wind up in bed, but there's no promiscuity. What the kids in the movie want is a straight version of success and happiness. The small touches of the movie give it its charm. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>, finding her friend has gone to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, spends her first night in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in an inn called <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and lavishly overdecorated with <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> paraphernalia. Scenes of young Japanese imitating Western rockers in a park are fun, as are other signs of the mix of East and West in modern <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. But the movie misses its chance to explore deeply the inevitable culture clash between <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hiro </PERSON>, and instead relies on repeated laments of `` you would n't understand'' and focuses on their common troubles. The movie is partly in Japanese, with subtitles. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tadokoro </PERSON> are quirky, energetic and engaging and keep `` <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Pop'' from being merely the kind of fluff <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> complains about having to sing. _ By <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacVean </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` The Seventh Sign'' -LRB- RCA-Columbia Pictures Video; VHS-Beta $ 89.95; Rated R -RRB- God has just about had it up to here with humanity, and anybody who rents this hokey bit of dreck about a modern-day biblical apocalypse will understand why. It's a miracle director <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> was n't struck by a bolt of lightning. We know the world's up the proverbial creek without a paddle because God's pock-marked messenger -LRB- <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Prochnow </PERSON> -RRB- is making all these nasty things happen. It's snowing in the Israeli desert; a Nicaraguan river runs bloody; there are all these dead fish off the Haitian coast, and let's not forget the rotten weather they're having in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, what with golf ball-sized hail, hurricane-force winds and earthquakes. Naturally, the only person who can deliver the world from God's wrath is a pregnant yuppie, played by <PERSON> Demi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> with all the passion and perception that has marked her many other unforgettable performances The seventh sign has to do with <PERSON> Demi </PERSON>'s baby; when it's born, dead and souless, that's all, folks. Unless Demi can come up with a miracle. Cripes, are we in trouble, or what? If you can hang on that long _ that in itself would be a miracle _ there's a hilarious scene at the end where <PERSON> Demi </PERSON> goes through the shortest labor in history while bleeding profusely from a major bullet wound during an earthquake that would have caused <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to drop into the ocean. Do n't bother. _ By <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryckman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> National Writer.

 `` Back by Popular Demand'' -LRB- Mercury -RRB- _ <PERSON> Kurtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Blow </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapper </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Blow </PERSON> wants you to know _ he's back. And, lest you forget it, five of the 10 songs on `` Back by Popular Demand'' deal with that fact. Blow's ego exercises on his latest album would be easy to fault if he did n't pull them off with such good humor, wit and some of the hottest music around. One of the original rap music stars, he took a self-imposed break from recording in 1986. As he raps in `` Still on the Scene,'' some of that time was spent `` watching cable, with my feet on the table, collecting royalties from my record label.'' But he had to come back, y ` see, because he's The Blow's got `` the answer for every dancer,'' he says in the title cut. And, as he defends himself against the critics and rap upstarts in `` I'm True to This'': `` I'm not new to this, I'm true to this.'' Then, in `` Get on Up,'' he says: `` Every bit of me - is the epitome - of rappin' excellence Get the picture? You kind of wish he would have crammed the attitudinizing into maybe two or three songs, though, because Blow really connects when he tackles other subjects. In `` Only the Strong Survive,'' for example, he paints a stark picture of crack devastation. The song opens with an ambulance dispatcher working the death of a 19-year-old. Later in the song, he graphically details the rise and fall of a young basketball prodigy who eventually drops dead on the court: `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> had problems - and the fans could tell - cos he used to play the game so well With the exception of `` Blue Iguana,'' a tropical-flavored dud, the music burns. The percussion, by <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Loya </PERSON>, is especially sharp and direct. Turn it up! Listen closely! Start dancing! Do it now! _ By <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Let It Roll'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Little Feat In music, as well as politics, preconceptions are important. No one brought great expectations to the release of a new Little Feat album in 1988, much like a droning public speaker anticipates a mediocre debate performance. After all, the influential 1970s band disintegrated more than a decade ago and former leader <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> is long since dead. So it's a surprise that the reformed Little Feat's new record, `` Let It Roll,'' contains some bracing music. The title cut, `` Hate to Lose Your Lovin,''' and `` One Clear Moment'' are all crackling good tunes, briskly-paced funk rock with powerful hooks. That alone is enough to make `` Let It Roll'' a success to most listeners _ it's already exceeded expectations. But this is a shallow album; the quality drops off precipitously after the three successes. `` Hanging on to the Good Times'' and `` Listen to Your Heart'' hearken back to the colorless days of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> rock, the former an insufferable tale of middle-aged rockers reminiscing about all-night parties. The aptly-titled `` Business As Usual'' comments on world affairs with this insightful passage: `` Came home last night, wishin' I could unwind. Turned on the news, you know it blew my mind.'' The song eventually becomes an attack on two easy targets _ television evangelists and the press. Unless those attacks can be done imaginatively, like <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s `` Dirty Laundry,'' they're nothing but a bore Little Feat's members are exceptional musicians, and they enlist vocal help from such pros as <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Raitt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>. But their music lacks the consistent inspiration that sets some musicians, as well as politicians, apart from the crowd. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'' -LRB- Mercury -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Many </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION> fans say the best thing about the group is singer <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovi </PERSON>'s hair. It does n't appear he's had it cut since the release of the band's last album, `` Slippery When Wet,'' which has sold 13 million copies. So `` New Jersey'' is likely to be another hit, even though <PERSON> Jon </PERSON>'s long locks ca n't be heard on the record. What can be heard are ripoffs of <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, the most blatant being the `` Hungry Heart'' - ish `` Born to be My Baby. On the next cut, `` Living in <LOCATION> Sin </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> mimics the harmony vocals of <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zandt </PERSON>, who used to be in <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s band. And then there's `` Blood on Blood,'' an unintentional parody of the Boss's narrative epics <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION> shows it has varied tastes by stealing three or four <PERSON> Aerosmith </PERSON> guitar riffs for `` Homebound Train.'' `` New Jersey'' contains flashes of originality and humor. The Top 10 hit, `` Bad Medicine,'' is good fun, with clever lyrics and an anthemic chorus. Two strong cuts close the record _ `` 99 in the Shade,'' a summertime party boogie tune, and `` Love for Sale,'' an acoustic bluesy shuffle. But the other 45 minutes of music is mostly loud, obnoxious, arrogant and dumb. Those ingredients sometimes make for great rock records, but `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'' is too derivative to be one. _ By <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Don't Give Mandy Patinkin Any Advice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 During a career that has taken him from <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and back again, <PERSON> Mandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON> has heard enough advice for a dozen careers. Now he's turning off. `` I do n't mean to be offensive to anybody who has the rules,'' he said during a visit from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters. `` For so long I tried to follow the rules and I was getting sicker and sicker and sicker, because none of them was working for me. `` I do n't know ... what's right, what kind of parts you're supposed to take, whether to put makeup on your face so people ca n't see you; you do a play or you do n't do a play; you do a movie for this reason or you do `` I do n't want to hear about it anymore. I want to be left alone, just go out and do my work. You could go nuts with theories about how to do it all.'' Whatever <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON> is doing, it seems to be working. He has been acclaimed for his stage roles as <PERSON> Che </PERSON> <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON> in `` Evita'' and as <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON> in `` Sunday in the Park With <PERSON> George </PERSON>.'' He has also made an impression in such films as `` Ragtime,'' `` Yentl,'' `` <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>,'' `` Maxie'' and `` The Princess Bride.'' Now, he's trying something a little different. He's a spaceling in `` Alien Nations,'' tracking down a murderous crew of drug dealers in partnership with cop <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Caan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON> is part of a group of immigrants who have been subjugated by drugs on another planet. `` I loved the character of <PERSON> George </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON>. `` He is far more human than the humans. What I loved about the script was the speech that he gave to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> about how you humans do n't live up to the standards that you set for yourselves. He thinks the human race is an extraordinary species and he does n't understand why they have so many problems in such a beautiful place.'' The actor admitted that he became entranced with makeup ever since he saw photos of <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> converting <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> into an old codger for `` Little Big Man.'' The idea of adopting the guise of a space creature was one of the lures for `` Alien Nation.'' But the lure turned into `` a nightmare.'' `` When we did the tests, it was five-six hours in the chair, and then 20-30 minutes in front of the camera,'' he said. `` Then the makeup came off when I dipped my head in the Dow chemical vat. `` On the first day of shooting, I was in the makeup chair for four-five hours, then I was on the set for 13 hours. And I panicked. `` I was absolutely going out of my mind. I had air-conditioning hoses going up my arms. I was absolutely encased in rubber, so my body temperature was about 110. Except for the whites of my eyes, there was n't a pore open. `` You get claustrophobic and you panic. I was also thinking: four months of this, I'm not going to make it. Get the lawyers. Sue me. I'm out of here. Then I thought: I do n't want that kind of hassle in the business; I'm going to die soon anyway.'' He was out sick for a few days, and he was more relaxed when he returned. <PERSON> Caan </PERSON> helped out by entertaining with songs and jokes while <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON> was in the makeup chair. <PERSON> Caan </PERSON>'s name for his alien co-star: Mr. <PERSON> Potatohead </PERSON>. Though one of the theater's authentic stars, <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON> would nonetheless like to be making more films. `` I like working in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> because my family is there, and I want to be near my kids,'' he said. `` But I also love making movies, and I like the fact that they reach such a large audience. That's a plus, though there's nothing like being on the boards with that crowd right there doing the play with you. I'd never give that up. `` I always knew that the stage was the first thing I was going to do. Because when I was 15, I started in the community theater -LRB- in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> -RRB-. That's what I did in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> first, but I always dreamed of being in the movies. And I still dream of being in the movies. I'm no difference from anyone else. Everyone dreams of being in the movies.''

He recently was appointed music director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lausanne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, effective in the fall of 1990, the year his contract ends in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. This season he conducts more than three months in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, he'll conduct nine operas, including <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Ring'' cycle, which he will bring to the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of the Performing Arts in June. `` Seventeen years in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> I think is enough,'' <PERSON> Lopez-Cobos </PERSON> said. `` The repertory system is very, very hard work. You have to switch from one opera to the next. You can not go only to do a new production and then disappear. I have to conduct everything. `` I knew before I accepted <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> that in'90 I would finish <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. I knew the first three years would be difficult, then I would have more time. I have decided that's my last opera house to run. It is not like before when singers stayed. They want to guest everywhere. We have terrible problems to make the repertory,'' he said. `` For a European conductor, it is so pleasant to be with one normal American orchestra. I could n't say no.'' Lopez-Cobos has a doctorate in philosophy from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION>. The subject has helped his conducting, he says. `` Every composer is a child of his time, of the mentality of his time. Most of them had relationships with philosophers. I think it is good if you have an idea of what was happening at the time of a composer's life `` I think specializing is a very bad thing. I hear, ` He is a very good Mozart conductor.' I think, ` He is already limited.' The more you know about differences between composers and their orchestral colors, the more you can use it in your work for other things.'' <PERSON> Lopez-Cobos </PERSON>, whose second wife died of cancer more than two years ago, is married to Cuba-born, America-educated lawyer <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON>, whom he met in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. He has two sons, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON>, 8, who live with relatives in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. The conductor was born in <LOCATION> Toro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, in February 1940, during a time of celebration at the end of the Spanish Civil War. His parents named him <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, he says, `` because they thought I was a gift of heaven. And <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is a very common name in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` I took a long time to decide between philosophy and music. My father was in the <ORGANIZATION> Wagner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> when he was in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> as a young man. He was interested in German culture, philosophy and music. I heard music at home. `` As a student in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> I conducted chorales. I was always interested in singing and the 16th and 17th century music of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.'' After getting his degree he went to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to study conducting. `` I'm a little bit fatalistic. There were two well-known conducting competitions, in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Besancon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' He entered, won third prize in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> in 1968 and first in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1969. `` This encouraged me to try -LRB- to become a conductor -RRB-. We know the chances in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> are almost zero. I knew I have to try outside <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, which is always more difficult than in your own country,'' he said. The first orchestra he conducted was the <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION>. Then, after spending the 1969-70 year at the <ORGANIZATION> Juilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lopez-Cobos </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` I knew <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maag </PERSON>, a Swiss conductor. I assisted him in some operas. In <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> he got sick and I had to conduct for him,'' he said. It was `` The Magic Flute,'' his opera-conducting debut, in 1970. Lopez-Cobos was 30. `` That was my chance,'' he said. `` I stayed almost a year in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, until I came to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. In 1971, <PERSON> Lorin </PERSON> <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON> resigned from the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> to take the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>. They decided to take three or four young conductors instead of a music director. I was invited for three performances. At the break -LRB- intermission -RRB- in the first, they offered me a four-year contract. I was unsure. My friends in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said, ` Go.''' He has been music director since 1981. His <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conducting debut was in 1972 in a performance of `` Lucia di Lammermoor,'' starring <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sills </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>. In 1986, <PERSON> Lopez-Cobos </PERSON> followed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielen </PERSON>, who moved to the <LOCATION> Baden-Baden </LOCATION> Radio Symphony in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as music director of the Cincinnati Symphony. <PERSON> Lopez-Cobos </PERSON> also has a recording project with <ORGANIZATION> Telarc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. `` My <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> contract is to 1991,'' he said. `` Probably I will come with my family to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, find a house and from here go to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: New Alter Ego for Harrison, Dylan, et al.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The true legend of the Traveling Wilburys began when <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Har </PERSON> ..., er, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilbury </PERSON> needed to record an extra song at short notice and invited two of his dinner companions to lend their voices. Nine days and 10 songs later, the result was one of those happy accidents that proves there's more to the music business than accountants and estates. You wo n't find the names <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> on `` Volume One,'' the debut album by the oddly-named Traveling Wilburys. But the dark glasses and pseudonyms ca n't hide those familiar talents. `` We definitely did n't want to treat this like a supergroup,'' said Petty, or <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilbury </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` I do n't even like the term all that much. But we were aware that it would be viewed as such. We look at the Wilburys as a completely other persona as ourselves.'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> mentioned to <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> over dinner last spring that he needed a new B-side for a 12-inch single release. The other two said they'd help him put together a song. The former Beatle had to retrieve his guitar, which he'd left at <ORGANIZATION> Petty </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> house during a visit a few days earlier, <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> said. The lead Heartbreaker was also asked to join in on the record. Since all the nearby studios were booked, the three amigos had to impose on another friend who had recording facilities in his house. <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> said he'd be glad to offer his assistance. `` We all sat around the grass at <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s house and wrote this song called ` Handle With Care' and recorded it that night,'' Petty recalled. `` When it was all done it sounded really good.'' Much too good, they thought, for a B-side. So they kept on writing and recording. `` It was a very innocent thing, really,'' <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> said. `` We were just kind of enjoying it and we were deep into it before we realized almost what we were doing.'' That spontaneity, and a lot of humor, comes through on the record. `` Volume One'' sounds like a group of friends, albeit extremely talented friends, enjoying themselves together. All five trade lead and backing vocals and strum guitars. The results are a cross between <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s early'70s solo work and the electronic flourishes <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> brought to the Electric Light Orchestra. <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON>'s `` Not Alone Any More'' is in the vein he's mined for a quarter-century and the three songs <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> dominates are some of his best work in years The song `` Dirty World'' pokes fun at Prince with a series of sexual double-entendres and the wickedly funny `` Tweeter and the Monkey Man'' is littered with <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> references. The record was a true collaboration, <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> said. On `` Tweeter,'' for instance, he and <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> spoke lyrics into a tape recorder then edited them into a story. Other Wilburys added the chorus, he said. Credit a non-rocker, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, with the name Traveling Wilburys, <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> performed at the Prince's Trust concert last year and were complimented by the host following the show, he said. The prince said the two should form a band, and when they asked for a name, he suggested the Traveling Wilburys, <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> said. The quintet quickly adopted the persona. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> is identified throughout as <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilbury </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> is <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilbury </PERSON>, <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> is <PERSON> Lefty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilbury </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s called Lucky. The whimsical liner notes explain that `` the original Wilburys were a stationary people who, realizing that their civilization could not stand still forever, began to go for short walks.'' The offbeat sense of humor seemed to take the pressure off the participants and lent the album a certain mystique, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Grein </PERSON>, author of the Chartbeat column in Billboard magazine. It's working _ the album debuted on the charts at No. 57 and shot to No. 23 in its second week, he said. `` It's destined to be a very big hit,'' <PERSON> Grein </PERSON> said. The Wilbury monikers also took some pressure off the businessmen, since <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, Petty and <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> are all contracted to different record companies. There are more than just joking reasons why all the names were left off the album jacket. <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> said the Wilburys have been approached to do a tour, and though no one's said no, they have n't all said yes, either. He hinted that the Wilbury family tree might be larger, but would n't say if a `` Volume Two'' is planned. There's the obvious risk of losing the spark that made this record special. `` I do n't think anybody wants the Wilburys to be work,'' he said. `` I would leave the door open to that. We would n't rule it out because we had so much fun. I think it could be done again, but not right away. `` We were all very pleased with the way it came out,'' Petty continued. `` It's so nice when you get the spirit into the vinyl. That's what you strive for. I hope everybody smiles when they hear it.''

 <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalven </PERSON> spent a decade shaping a book out of 1,000-page manuscript and a mountain of raw material _ the unfinished life's work of his father, a legal scholar. Although <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalven </PERSON> died with his task incomplete, he helped his son see it through. The result is `` A Worthy Tradition,'' a 700-page act of filial devotion, a scholarly essay on the First Amendment and how its protections were broadened by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> between World War I and the early 1970s. `` Almost everything I know about my father's views of the Fiame after his death,'' said <PERSON> Kalven </PERSON>, who is not a lawyer. The First Amendment, his father said, has been continually enriched and elaboraterst Amendment cd by the ongoing dialogue of society and courts addressing the countless issues it embraces. Among the book's central themes is an argument that criticism of the government or its officials _ seditious libel _ should never be a crime. `` A Worthy Tradition'' was published this year by <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Row and sells for $ 35. The book bears the elder <PERSON> Kalven </PERSON>'s name as author with a notation that his son edited it. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalven </PERSON> was a noted legal scholar at the Universiteatle. <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> played piano, sang harmony and was producer of the song `` T-shirt'' on the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> band's current album of the same name. `` They are probably the first rock' n' roll band I remember,'' <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said in a promotional videotape for the Crickets. `` I've always been a fan of theirs. The McCartney-Crickets collaboration, done at <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>'s recording studio in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, evolved from the Crickets' appearance two years ago at <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>'s annual Buddy Holly Week celebration At that time, the ex-Beatle said he was interested in working with the group. The album is the first in about 10 years for the Crickets, whose name inspired <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> to name their band after another insect. `` It is basic rock' n' roll with three pieces -LRB- instruments -RRB-,'' says Cricket <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> `` J.I.'' <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, a drummer. `` It's basically what we did back in the'50s.'' <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON>, who is still a member, founded the Crickets in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, in 1957. They were known for such hits as `` <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON>,'' `` That'll Be the Day'' and `` Maybe Baby.'' <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> died on Feb. 3, 1959, with <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> <PERSON> Valens </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> `` Big Bopper'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> when a tour plane they were flying in crashed in a <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> cornfield. The pilot also perished. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>'s life was the subject of the 1979 movie, `` The Buddy Holly Story'' starring <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Valens </PERSON>' life was recounted in the recent motion picture `` La Bamba.'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lobos </LOCATION> did a version of the traditional Mexican song <PERSON> Valens </PERSON> had made into a hit, `` <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bamba </LOCATION>,'' and made it a No. 1 tune on the record charts in 1987. <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON> were not with <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> when the plane crashed because <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> had moved from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and was using new members of his band. The two performed occasionally as Crickets in the 1960s, but did not really get back together until 10 years ago. At that time, they began performing as Crickets again as the opening act for country music star <PERSON> Waylon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, who had been accompanying <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> on the concert tour when he was killed. In fact, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> gave up his seat on the plane to the Big Bopper. The third current Cricket is <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, lead vocalist and guitarist, who joined in 1985. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> admits he does n't sound like <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>. `` I've tried, but I do n't,'' he said of the former bandleader's style. The band plays an equal amount of new and old material, though the album is new songs. They close their concerts with `` That'll Be the Day.'' `` It was our first song and got us started and out of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> recalled. `` It seems to be the most familiar one to all the people.'' In the past year, the three have performed throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. A tour of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is in the works for 1989. <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said the Crickets played in garages in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> in the 1950s, but did not take their name from a cricket they heard chirping as portrayed in the movie about <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>. Instead, they were inspired by another band called the Spiders. `` We thought insects were a neat name. We got a list from somewhere and decided to pick another insect,'' <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>'s legacy is that `` he showed that you do n't have to be a real ` pretty boy' or that you do n't have to have a lot of money to entertain or have a rock' n' roll band. `` It showed a lot of people that you could get up and write some songs and play and not have a whole bunch of publicity behind you. We sort of wrote the songs ourselves and produced them ourselves. He was n't your idol-looking kind of guy you'd see in Photoplay. He just wanted to sing and play,'' he said. `` It was simple music, uncomplicated so anybody could pick it up. I've heard that anybody could go get a guitar on Saturday night and learn ` That'll Be the Day' and those three-chord songs and have'em a little group. Before that, it seemed harder.'' Said <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>: `` He sang with such feeling and intensity. Even <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> says he listens to old Crickets' records to ` keep it honest.' He left behind a mold for other singers: what you're supposed to try to do. <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON>, the Crickets' bass player, said he did n't try to interfere with <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>'s work on their album. `` He asked for suggestions. My answer was usually, ` Whatever you think, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. ``

<HEAD>Clash Over Theory Blaming Genetic Flaw For Many Mental Disorders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A geneticist and his psychologist wife say they have linked mental disorders including mania, depression, hyperactivity, compulsive overeating and alcoholism to a single, inherited genetic flaw. If they're right, the finding could revolutionize the treatment of mental illness. Difficult and expensive psychotherapy could be replaced with new drugs that would compensate for the genetic defect. However, some geneticists say Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Comings </PERSON> of the City of <ORGANIZATION> Hope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and his wife, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON>, are guilty of a colossal mistake or careless misuse of science. An angry debate over their work erupted recently at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Comings </PERSON>, president of the society this year, used his presidential address to defend his findings. He detailed a long list of behavioral disorders that he said occurred with unusually high frequency in the relatives of people with Tourette syndrome. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauls </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> presented similar research that directly contradicted the Comings' findings. <PERSON> Pauls </PERSON> and his colleagues found no unusually high incidence of other disorders in families with Tourette syndrome. After <PERSON> Pauls </PERSON> presented his data and responded to critical questions from <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Comings </PERSON>, geneticists lingered to continue the discussion. `` I disagree with you completely,'' Dr. <PERSON> Arno </PERSON> <PERSON> Motulsky </PERSON>, professor of medicine and genetics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, told the Comingses. `` You make these grandiose schemes without evidence.'' In <PERSON> Motulsky </PERSON>'s view, that's a misuse of scientific data _ making hypotheses that ca n't be supported by the facts. `` You revolutionize genetics if it's true _ but I think it's very unlikely,'' he said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Comings </PERSON> was visibly hurt by the criticism; <PERSON> Motulsky </PERSON> had been his teacher. `` I think you are making claims that harken back to the early days of genetics ... I think you're doing genetics a disservice,'' <PERSON> Motulsky </PERSON> continued, referring to the early 20th century, when laziness, prostitution and criminality were said to be the result of bad genes. The implication was that it was a good idea to sterilize such people, thereby ridding the population of undesirable traits, says <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kevles </PERSON>, a historian at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and author of `` In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity.'' Making such generalizations has led to wildly erroneous and damaging misuse of science in the past and could easily do so again, <PERSON> Kevles </PERSON> said. He said he had n't read the Comingses' report and could n't comment on it directly. Not everyone at the genetics meeting was critical of the Comingses' work. Some praised the pair for their courage in proposing such a daring hypothesis. Dr. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> McKusick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a medical geneticist who has done extensive family studies with the Amish in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, said, `` I lean toward the view that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Comings </PERSON> is closer to the truth. He's a perceptive person.'' Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rimoin </PERSON>, director of medical genetics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, noted that even if the Tourette gene is responsible for some cases of mania, hyperactivity and compulsive behavior it is not likely to be the cause of all cases of those disorders. `` Many different causes can produce the same disease traits,'' and a single disorder _ such as <ORGANIZATION> Tourette </ORGANIZATION> _ can show itself in many ways, `` so I'm not surprised'' by the Comings findings, <PERSON> Rimoin </PERSON> said. Even the Comingses' most ferocious critics accused them of no worse offense than shoddy science; there was no suggestion of deliberate distortion. The Comingses based their conclusions on extensive studies of families of patients with Tourette syndrome, an inherited disorder marked by jerky movements, or tics, and uncontrollable vocal mannerisms including grunts, yelps, barks and sometimes involuntary outbursts of profanity. The syndrome had been thought rare, occurring in at least one in 2,000 Americans, but <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Comings </PERSON> said in an interview he believes it occurs in as many as 1 in 200 _ or about 1 million _ Americans, usually becoming evident in the young, more often in boys than in girls. In a 166-page report in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Comingses </PERSON> said that attention-deficit disorder, with or without hyperactivity, is 10 times more common in Tourette families than in the general population. Obsessive-compulsive behavior is five times as common. Conduct disorders, 17 times as common. Stuttering, five times. Dyslexia, six times. Panic attacks, 13 times. Multiple phobias, three times. Depression, 11 times. Mania and severe anxiety, 20 times as common. At the genetics meeting, Comings added alcoholism, compulsive overeating and drug abuse. Other associated symptoms include auditory hallucinations, short temper, exhibition and easiness to anger. All of these disorders are manifestations of the yet-to-be-discovered gene that causes Tourette syndrome, the couple asserted. They explain the findings by suggesting that the gene is associated with a biochemical loss of inhibitions. `` Many of the features of -LRB- Tourette syndrome -RRB- can be visualized as disinhibited, active, intrusive symptoms ...,'' they wrote. <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Comings </PERSON> say <PERSON> Pauls </PERSON> does n't see the connections because, unlike them, he does n't treat patients with Tourette syndrome. <PERSON> Pauls </PERSON> is a geneticist, not a psychologist. <PERSON> Pauls </PERSON> says his studies included interviews with many relatives of Tourette syndrome patients, while many of the Comingses' studies were based on interviews with only patients and their parents. `` Our -LRB- finding -RRB- is based on direct interview information,'' <PERSON> Pauls </PERSON> said. `` Theirs is based more on clinical impression.'' In a lengthy letter in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generics </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pauls </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> colleagues exhaustively criticized the Comingses' findings They said the weaknesses in their research `` make it impossible to accept as valid any of the results presented ...'' That's strong language for an exchange in a scientific journal. `` One of our major criticisms of Comings is that he confuses symptoms with diagnosis,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> researchers. `` Tourette syndrome patients have symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder but do not have the disorder ... Different disorders can have symptoms in common.'' <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, past president of the <ORGANIZATION> Tourette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndrome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the Comingses' findings have created confusion among patients. `` Our organization was contacted by people who have problems with substance abuse, problems with obesity, problems with anorexia'' who suddenly thought they might be carriers of the Tourette syndrome gene, <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> said. `` We had to be even-handed about saying the jury is out,'' she said. The jury may not be out for long. The association is spending $ 200,000 this year to enable six laboratories in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to search for the Tourette syndrome gene, or a genetic marker that will indicate its approximate location on human chromosomes. Once such a marker is found, researchers will be able to directly test the Comingses' hypothesis. That could happen within the next few years or the next few months, <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> said. Despite their differences, <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Comings </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> group agree on one thing: Resolution of the controversy will benefit patients. `` The progress of science often involves debate and argument over data that do n't agree, trying to find out why they do n't agree,'' said <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>. `` In the best sense, this controversy can help the broader scientific community understand what is different about the two groups. Maybe some third party will gain some insight that neither of us has.''

 As <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Swerdlow </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, died of cancer, they felt pain, then anger and bitterness, and finally resolve. `` When you lose your own child, you have a responsibility to see that his life has not been totally wasted,'' said <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Swerdlow </PERSON>. `` You also have a responsibility to other parents.'' The Swerdlows started FACT, a grassroots organization aimed at raising public awareness of cancer and persuading the government and public to spend more fighting a disease that touches three out of four American families. Like many Americans, they gave little thought about the extent of cancer until their son, a 41-year-old physician in nuclear medicine and radiology, died from leukemia Feb. 28, 1985. `` The things we saw made us very, very unhappy with ourselves and very unhappy with the world we live in,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Swerdlow </PERSON>. `` Why do n't we lick this thing, this cancer?'' FACT, which has grown to over 22,000 people in 18 states in 2 -LCB- years, initially was called Families Against Cancer Terror, but ` Terror' was dropped after groups like the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> protested its negative connotations. `` Anyone who's ever suffered through the pain of cancer with a loved one knows terror is an accurate description of what this diseases puts individuals and families through,'' said <PERSON> Swerdlow </PERSON>, whose eyes still become moist when he speaks of cancer's toll on his family. FACT does n't promote itself as a support group, but it has that effect. `` It was n't until we learned about FACT that we realized we were n't as alone as we felt,'' said <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouverat </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, whose 17-year-old son <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> died in February, 22 months after being diagnosed with brain cancer. `` You know an individual does n't get cancer, a family does. It's a wonderful idea to band families together,'' she said `` It's not the original purpose, but it does become a support network, too.'' FACT's main purpose is to refute the idea that scientists are winning the battle against cancer. That misperception has effected funding for groups like the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're making progress, there's no doubt. But when you talk about cancer, you're talking about hundreds of different kinds, from just as many causes. The fight against cancer has gotten a lot of publicity but the fact remains, we're not doing as nearly enough as we can or should be doing,'' said <PERSON> Swerdlow </PERSON>. `` Cancer is an epidemic,'' added Mrs. <PERSON> Swerdlow </PERSON>. `` It's a national problem that needs a national solution, the threat is so great.'' Here are some of the grim facts they cite: _ More than 500,000 Americans die yearly from cancer, another 1 million are diagnosed and another 5 million are treated _ Cancer claims a life in this country every 80 seconds on average _ One out of every three children born this year stands a chance of developing some type of cancer in his or her lifetime _ Cancer is the greatest killer of children and kills more people through the age of 54 than any other cause _ Cancer drains the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy of approximately $ 70 billion yearly in earnings lost and medical care costs `` This year, eight times as many people will die of cancer than died in the entire <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. Look at what we spend to prevent enemies from attacking our country. But here we have a silent enemy that is invading millions of bodies, and we're not mobilizing our resources,'' said <PERSON> Swerdlow </PERSON>. `` It's useful to have groups like this,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>, the director for cancer control and prevention at the <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. `` The more the public understands cancer research and what it takes to battle cancer, the better the chances we can conquer it.''

 <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Langway </PERSON>'s laboratory holds six miles of ice that reveal volumes about <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s past and, perhaps, its future. `` It's all there ... frozen in time,'' said <PERSON> Langway </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> lab </ORGANIZATION> contains the nation's store of ice core samples from <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> _ a record of natural history stretching 150,000 years. Ice, formed as layer after layer of snow fell and was compacted, provides a seasonal record more detailed than tree rings or sea floor sediments, he said. Using techniques <PERSON> Langway </PERSON> pioneered, researchers have begun analyzing ancient ice molecules. Oxygen isotopes record yearly temperature variations. Dust levels show prehistoric volcanic activity. Tiny bubbles of air give direct evidence of what the atmosphere was like thousands of years ago. The water that makes up the ice can indicate natural levels of elements such as lead, cadmium, sulfur and chlorine, and can be used to gauge the effect industrial activity. The ice cores, six miles of them, are kept in 4-inch-diameter, meter-long aluminum cylinders in a refrigerator at 10 degrees below zero. Technicians in parkas, their beards and eyebrows frosted, prepare the ice for <PERSON> Langway </PERSON>'s experiments and for shipment to scientists at another universities. `` We're just beginning to unlock the secrets in the ice,'' said <PERSON> Langway </PERSON>, 59, a heavy-set, chain-smoking geology professor who has a mountain named after him in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. He sometimes jokes about spending more than five years in polar regions researching ice _ `` Man is the only animal stupid enough to wander about out there'' _ but he clearly believes in his work. Particularly in some controversial research involving gases trapped in the ice cores. Scientists have noted a sharp increase in carbon dioxide in the last 150 years since the beginning of the industrial age, part of the debate about the `` greenhouse effect,'' global warming from the buildup of heat-trapping gases from industrial emissions and deforestation. `` A full understanding of how the planet works ca n't be obtained without considering the ice,'' <PERSON> Langway </PERSON> said. Changes in the level of carbon dioxide in the past have coincided with changes in the climate. Levels of the gas may even be part of a mechanism that causes ice ages and global warming trends. There have been seven or eight times when the Earth's climate changed drastically, with glaciers enveloping the continents and then retreating, he explained. Carbon dioxide levels were very low 20,000 years ago, when the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> was at its coldest. About 13,000 years ago, atmospheric carbon dioxide began to increase. About 10,000 years ago, the ice began to retreat amidst violent weather changes probably brought about by increase volcanic activity. Some scientists think the Earth may soon undergo a major climate change brought on by pollution. They have developed computer models showing disastrous consequences such as droughts and rising ocean levels over the next 50 years. <PERSON> Langway </PERSON>, however, is emphatic about not drawing conclusions for the future from current ice core research. `` You can speculate like hell, but we just have n't done enough research to have all the answers.'' One problem is a shortage of ice. <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>'s ice sheet is the size of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> is 10 times larger; even six miles of cores in storage is `` like putting a teacup in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and trying to figure out what's been going on in between,'' he said. <PERSON> Langway </PERSON> will take part in two international expeditions next year that will drill in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> _ the first new drilling since 1981.

<HEAD>Clash Over Theory Blaming Genetic Flaw For Many Mental Disorders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A geneticist and his psychologist wife say they have linked mental disorders including mania, depression, hyperactivity, compulsive overeating and alcoholism to a single, inherited genetic flaw. If they're right, the finding could revolutionize the treatment of mental illness. Difficult and expensive psychotherapy could be replaced with new drugs that would compensate for the genetic defect. However, some geneticists say Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Comings </PERSON> of the City of <ORGANIZATION> Hope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and his wife, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON>, are guilty of a colossal mistake or careless misuse of science. An angry debate over their work erupted recently at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Comings </PERSON>, president of the society this year, used his presidential address to defend his findings. He detailed behavioral disorders that he said occurred with unusually high frequency in relatives of those with Tourette syndrome, including attention-deficit disorder, obsessive-compulsive behavior, stuttering, dyslexia, multiple phobias, depression, mania and severe anxiety, alcoholism, drug abuse and compulsive overeating. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauls </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> presented similar research that directly contradicted the Comings' findings. <PERSON> Pauls </PERSON> and his colleagues found no unusually high incidence of other disorders in families with Tourette syndrome. After <PERSON> Pauls </PERSON> presented his data and responded to critical questions from <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Comings </PERSON>, geneticists lingered to continue the discussion. Not everyone at the genetics meeting was critical of the Comingses' work. Some praised the pair for their courage in proposing such a daring hypothesis. Even their strongest critics accused them of no worse offense than shoddy science. The Comingses based their conclusions on extensive studies of families of patients with Tourette syndrome, an inherited disorder marked by jerky movements, or tics, and uncontrollable vocal mannerisms including grunts, yelps, barks and sometimes involuntary outbursts of profanity. They say <PERSON> Pauls </PERSON> does n't see the connections because, unlike them, he does n't treat patients with Tourette syndrome. <PERSON> Pauls </PERSON>, a geneticist, says his studies included interviews with many relatives of Tourette syndrome patients, while many of the Comingses' studies were based on interviews with only patients and their parents. <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, past president of the <ORGANIZATION> Tourette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndrome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the association is spending $ 200,000 this year to enable six labs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to search for the gene, or a genetic marker that will indicate its approximate location on human chromosomes.

<HEAD>NASA, Forest Service Developing New Tool To Map Forest Fires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory have started to develop an aircraft-mounted, computerized sensing system to quickly map forest fires and their hot spots. FIREFLY will be an improvement over the existing FLAME system, which has been used extensively to map major fires, including last summer's conflagration at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>. FLAME captures infrared heat measurements on film, but the aircraft carrying it must land and an interpreter then must transfer the information by hand to maps in a process that takes hours, said lab spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. FIREFLY will provide maps in minutes, using Global Positioning System satellites to make more accurate measurements and to transmit data directly to fire camps for computerized plotting on maps. `` Cutting the turnaround time in getting information to the firefighters is the key,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, FIREFLY manager at <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, which runs <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s unmanned space exploration program for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Preschool Accidents May Forecast More Injuries Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Children who seem prone to injury as preschoolers are at high risk of more accidents between ages 5 and 10, a new study suggests. Parents of 10,394 British children were asked about injuries requiring medical advice or treatment, including poisonings and nonaccidental injuries. Those who had three or more serious injuries before age 5 were nearly six times as likely to have at least three more accidents between ages 5 and 10. Early injuries were the most potent of several characteristics predicting accidents between ages 5 and 10, and may indicate children who need preventive help, said the researchers from <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bristol </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The study is reported in the November issue of the journal Pediatrics. Despite the association between early and later injuries, researchers said most children who had multiple accidents after age 5 had not had three or more injuries before that age. This finding emphasizes the need to provide a safe environment for all children, they said. Other characteristics found to predict injuries between ages 5 and 10 were being a boy, aggressive behavior, having a young mother and having many older and few younger siblings.

 Medical students should be required to perform community service as part of their training to become physicians, a panel of doctors and medical school officials has concluded. The requirement would `` reinforce and demonstrate student and institutional commitment to the tenet that physicians have responsibilities for improving the health of the communities they serve,'' especially the poor and those lacking access to medical care, the panel said. The committee, convened under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said opinions differed on when the community service should be done and how long it should last.

 Widespread labor shortages and higher inflation will increase the pressure on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employers to raise salaries and benefits in 1989, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The business-financed research group said in a report released today that its panel of 10 business and human resources experts predicted private industry wages and benefits would grow by 5 percent next year, up from 3.7 percent in the year ended this September. That compares with expected inflation of 5 percent next year, which would be up from the current annual rate of 4.2 percent for 1988. `` Six full years of economic recovery have produced the tightest labor market in decades,'' said <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> management counsellor. `` Business seems to have reached the edge of the population's capacity to produce additional trained workers.'' `` Employers are staffing their operations with greater difficulty and at rising cost,'' <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> said. Panelists indicated many employers would attempt to deal with labor shortages by increasing productivity, creating entirely new jobs and tapping the continuing growth in the number of women workers. The panelists stated labor shortages next year would continue to be the worst in such major metropolitan areas as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, and were spreading to growth areas such as <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` It is often difficult to fill secretarial and clerical positions in downtown areas, such as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, due to less-than-attractive commuting situations and the high costs of parking, food and dress,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Margol </PERSON>, and executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Thus, ` stealing' efficient secretaries occurs not only between companies but also within companies,'' he said. The panel also indicated there are shortages of highly skilled workers, including teachers, nurses and other licensed health care workers, in many regions. Some of the nation's greatest labor shortages were in the category of lower-paid, entry-level jobs that are staffed largely by 16-24 year olds with no formal training or experience, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> stated. However, the proportion of 16-24 year olds in the work force is declining, while many of the 10 million of the new jobs created in the past five years have been such entry-level type positions. `` The rising and continuing demand for these workers have virtually exhausted the diminishing supply of employable peopole who are able and willing to accept work,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fromstein </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Manpower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Milwaukee-based temporary employment concern. `` This phenomenon was anticipated by demographers, economists and planners, yet has caught many major employers by surprise as it unfolds.''

 The dollar firmed in early European trading today. Gold prices fell. Foreign currency dealers said the dollar rose in earlier Asian trading on expectations of higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates following the increase in the British base lending rate from 12 percent to 13 percent on Friday. Some traders said the dollar was also helped by hopes the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> may reach an agreement on crude oil prices and production. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> did reach an agreement today to cut production, a move which is expected to boost prices. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar surged 0.85 yen to close at 122.00 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 122.05 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.7335 West German marks, up from 1.7154; 1.4500 Swiss francs, up from 1.4365; 5.9210 French francs, up from 5.8615; 1.9535 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9368; 1,285.50 Italian lire, up from 1,275.50; 1.1918 Canadian dollars, unchanged In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.8385, slightly cheaper for buyers than late Friday's $ 1.8435.

 The dollar rose against the Japanese yen today. Stock prices plunged due to concern over higher oil prices and the possibility of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rate increase. At the end of trading, the dollar was quoted at 122.00 yen, up 0.85 yen from Friday's close of 121.15 yen. Expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may raise key lending rates fueled dollar purchases, dealers said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues plunged 380.27 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 28,983.32. Analysts said a combination of the firmer dollar and investors' concern over a possible rate increase and higher oil prices triggered a round of profit-taking It was the largest decline posted by the index since Aug. 29. The dollar was bought in expectation that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monetary authorities may raise prime lending rates and the nation's discount rate, the rate the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to commercial banks, a dealer at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> told reporters Monday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank was closely watching for a possible move by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The dollar opened higher at 121.60 yen and moved between 121.58 yen and 122.00 yen throughout the day. The firmer dollar and expectations of a tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> encouraged investors to take profits from the recent rally on the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market, pushing prices lower, analysts said. Investors were ready for a round of profit-taking after an eight-session rally that ended early last week, traders said. During the rally the Nikkei rose 1,263 points, or 4.5 percent. Until Monday, it had given up only about 67 points of that gain. `` The view is spreading that there is a strong likelihood the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will raise its discount rate,'' said a division chief at <ORGANIZATION> Taiheiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, who asked not to be named. The dollar's rebound was also hard on prices, he said. The market has risen along with the stronger yen, which is believed to dampen inflation by lowering import prices, taking pressure off the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its monetary policy. Trading was heaviest in large-volume steels and heavy industrials. Investors sold steels, constructions and oil issues, anticipating that prices will rise when an agreement on production limits is reached in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> among the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

<HEAD>Machinists Accept Pratt &amp; Whitney Offer; Union Forecasts Tough Road

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A union official predicted `` difficult times'' at <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> after machinists narrowly approved a new contract despite cuts in medical benefits that angered many workers. Sunday's vote was 3,632-3 ,611 to accept the contract `` With 50 percent of the people unhappy, I would say we're probably going to go through some difficult times,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON>, one of the chief negotiators for local 91 of the Machinists' union, which represents about 9,000 <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> workers Another 4,000 workers are covered by the contract. Negotiators for the union and the jet engine manufacturer reached an agreement on the contract last week. It calls for wage increases of 9 percent spread over three years, and retains a semi-annual cost-of-living adjustment for the machinists, whose pay averages about $ 12.70 per hour. Most workers who opposed the contract objected to a provision requiring workers to pay 20 percent of their hospitilaztion costs, up to a maximum of $ 500 per year for individuals and $ 1,000 per family. Previously, the company had paid all hospitalization costs above $ 150. `` Now they want to ` 80-20' us,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> machinist who voted against the contract. `` What's next? Seventy-thirty? Fifty-fifty?'' The contract covers workers at <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> plants in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Southington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>. The company, which employs 45,000 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, is a division of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're extremely pleased that the union membership has voted to approve the contract,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Linke </PERSON>. `` We're disappointed by the closeness of the vote, but we had to address what is both a local and a national problem of rising health care costs.'' Sunday's voting at the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> was anything but a solidarity rally. Angry workers filled the auditorium with boos as union negotiators read unpopular portions of the contract. Before the results were announced, many workers were talking about striking. `` It gets to a point, over time, where you've got to take a stand,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Pixton </PERSON>, a machinist in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pixton </PERSON> said workers are particularly concerned about health benefits because of the `` obvious physical hazards of the job,'' including potentially dangerous machines and chemicals. Union leaders, including <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON>, had urged workers to accept the contract. They said the contract `` gains significant ground'' in four areas: raises instead of lump sum payments, job security, pensions, and union security. `` Our health insurance has suffered a loss in some areas,'' the union negotiating committee said in a statement urging workers to ratify the contract. `` It remains, however, the best health care coverage among <ORGANIZATION> UTC </ORGANIZATION> companies, and is better than the health care coverage at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON> said negotiators accepted the cut in health benefits `` based on the way negotiations have been going throughout the country.'' <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON> said he understood from the negotiations that the new 80-20 provision will eventually affect all <ORGANIZATION> UTC </ORGANIZATION> workers. He estimated that the policy, when applied to the entire corporation, will save <ORGANIZATION> UTC </ORGANIZATION> $ 30 to $ 40 million per year.

<HEAD>Newspaper Executive Resigns in Stock Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior executive of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper resigned Monday to take responsibility for involving the prominent daily in a stock trading scandal, the newspaper reported. An official of <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Iwao </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruyama </PERSON>, 67, vice president of the nationally circulated newspaper, had resigned, saying: `` I would like to take moral responsibility as I gave serious trouble to the <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> newspaper.'' His resignation was accepted at a special board of directors meeting, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity,. <PERSON> Maruyama </PERSON> bought 5,000 shares of Rescruit-Cosmos, a real estate firm, in the fall of 1986 before the stock was offered to the public. On Saturday, a <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> spokesman quoted <PERSON> Maruyama </PERSON> as saying he bought the shares `` without even knowing they were unlisted.'' Saturday night, <PERSON> Maruyama </PERSON> brought the actual shares to a news conference to prove he had not sold them for a profit. The <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in a statement: `` It is regrettable that he -LRB- <PERSON> Maruyama </PERSON> -RRB- had not disclosed his purchase of stock until recently as he is an executive of the newspaper that has been working to make clear the scandal.'' It said the newspaper's investigation of the scandal would not be affected by <PERSON> Maruyama </PERSON>'s actions. <PERSON> Maruyama </PERSON> was the second newspaper excutive to resign for involvement in the scandal. <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>, president of the financial newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, quit in July after his purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> stock became known. Recruit officials made the stock available to some of the nation's top politicians, businessmen and journalists, who reaped huge proficts after the company was listed on the over-the-counter market in October 1986. No laws were broken, but the transactions raised serious ethical questions about the ties between big business and politics in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The government has since tightened the laws on insider stock trading, but the measures are not retroactive. Prime Minister <PERSON> Nobuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> and former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> are among those who have acknowledged their aides bought Recruit stock, but they all have denied they knew about it at the time. Opposition parties have charged that more than 1 million shares were involved and that <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, who has since resigned as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION>, offered them to a few hundred prominent people in return for favors. One of <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>'s aide, <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsubara </PERSON>, was arrested on bribery chares in October after he offered money to an opposition lawmaker in an effort to obtain a favorable investigation of Rescruit-Cosmos in Parliament.

 Stocks opened mixed today in slow trading, influenced by new uncertainty about the outlook for inflation, interest rates and the dollar.

Among broader indicators, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index of all listed issues rose 0.34 to 150.97.

Gaining and declining issues were nearly even on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, with 415 up, 414 down and 495 unchanged. Volume totaled 14.96 million shares after the first 30 minutes of trading. Wall Street strategists were divided about the market's direction Many said prices were due to strengthen given the pessimism that has pervaded for awhile, making some stocks attractive.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy will continue to expand in the near future, the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Monday as it released its monthly leading indicator. `` The basic trend remains unchanged,'' an agency official said. `` The economy has remained in an expansionary phase and it will continue to do so in the future.'' The agency said the index jumped to 50 in September from 33.3 in the previous two months. Ordinarily an index reading below 50 indicates an economic contraction, but agency officials said the low readings for earlier months were statistical flukes. In other reports Monday on the Japanese economy: _ Production at <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s factories and mines rose 6.6 percent in October from a year earlier but fell 0.8 percent on an adjusted basis from the previous month, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said _ Japanese steel makers exported 1.906 million metric tons of steel in October, down 8.6 percent from a year earlier, but the value of the exports rose because more of the steel was of high-priced, specialty varieties, the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Iron and <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> said _ Japanese motor-vehicle manufacturers exported 521,932 cars and commercial vehicles in October, down 2.1 percent from a year earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said It was the seventh consecutive decline, following a 1.6 percent decline in September. Increased overseas production by Japanese makers has made it less urgent to export vehicles from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, officials said. Despite the yen's sharp upturn, which has made exports less profitable, many Japanese companies have been reporting strong gains in sales and earnings. A senior <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> official was reported to have indicated last Friday that the gross national product may have increased at an annual rate of between 6 and 8 percent in the July-September quarter from the previous three months.

 The number of working oil and gas rigs fell by 12 this week to a total 911, reversing a gain of 26 rigs in the previous week, industry watcher <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported. The decline continues to reflect an unstable trend in the rig count. A year ago the count was 1,161, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said Monday. The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.

In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to referee an important railroad industry dispute affecting the ability of railroads to sell off their lines and reduce their work forces. The court said it will use appeals involving the small <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Erie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to resolve issues troubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide. At issue, in part, is the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to exempt railroads from collective bargaining when they sell rail lines. A key related question involves the authority of federal courts to block strikes in such cases. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration supported the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION>'s plea that the court settle the issues, which have generated disagreement among lower courts. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last year that the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Erie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -LRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; LE -RRB- may not sell its 182 miles of rail line in western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Ohion </LOCATION> without engaging in collective bargaining. The appeals court said the federal Railway Labor Act requires the railorad to bargain with the unions over the effects the proposed sale would have in eliminating jobs. The appeals court also ruled that the federal courts lack authority to block a strike by the workers. The appeals court said a federal law known as the Norris-LaGuardia Act deprives federal judges of the power to bar strikes in such circumstances. The appeals court rejected the railroad's arguments that the act may be set aside in cases where the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> has approved proposed rail line sales. There is `` no inherent incompatibility'' between recent congressional efforts to deregulate the railroad industry and the aim of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to protect railway workers, the appeals court said. `` Implicit in the congressional vision of a vigorous free market is the realization that all major participants in the economy must be left free to exercise their economic strength,'' the appeals court said. The financially troubled P & amp; LE announced in July 1987 it would sell its rail lines to a newly formed company that planned to operate the lines with fewer workers. The <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> approved the plan without requiring the railroad to engage in collective bargaining with its unions, which then called a strike in September 1987. P & amp; LE currently is seeking a new purchaser for the lines other than the newly formed company, called <ORGANIZATION> Railco </ORGANIZATION>. After <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a 1980 deregulation law, the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> has been encouraging railroads to sell rather than abandon less profitable regional lines. The commission adopted a process to streamline sales by relieving railroads of any obligation to bargain with employees. In a related action, the high court rejected an appeal by labor unions challenging the sale of 208 miles of track between <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, by <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The court left intact a ruling by the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> blocking a strike by the unions over the loss of some 200 jobs. The three cases are <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Erie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1589, <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> LE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> vs. RLE, 87-1888 and RLE vs. C & amp; NW, 88-464.

 Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened slightly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in response to a report that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had signed a new grain agreement in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The early drop in prices exemplified the old market adage, `` Buy the rumor, sell the fact,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` An agreement was rumored last week and that drove the market up last week. Now they're selling it off. That's it in a nutshell,'' he said. The pact is reportedly a 2-year extension of the 5-year agreement that expired Sept. 30, guaranteeing Soviet purchases of 9 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain a year. Weekend showers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean regions helped dampen interest in buying soybean futures, analysts said. In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 2 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.23 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 2 \ cents lower with December at $ 2.62 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 \ cents lower with December at $ 2.12 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 -RCB- cents to 6 \ cents lower with January at $ 7.59 Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .08 cent to .27 cent higher with December at 73.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .33 cent higher with January at 83 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .45 cent higher with December at 40.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .13 cent to .75 cent higher with February at 43.20 cents a pound. Cattle futures closed higher on Friday while pork futures were mixed.

 Stock prices turned narrowly lower in slow trading today after several major banks announced they were raising their prime lending rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 5.33 points to 2,069.35 by noon EST. Among broader indicators, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index of all listed issues slipped 0.10 to 151.55. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market-value index rose 0.03 to 291.22. Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about 7-to-5, with 686 stocks falling, 526 rising and 552 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> volume was light, with 54.02 million shares changing hands by midday. Led by <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Manhattan </PERSON>, several of the nation's biggest banks said today they were increasing their prime interest rates to 10.5 percent from 10 percent. The increase, effective immediately, pushes the base lending rate to its highest level since May 1985, when it was lowered a half percentage point to 10 percent. Today's increase was the fourth in the prime rate this year. Analysts had been expecting a prime hike due to the steady increase of interest rates in the credit markets in recent weeks. Stock prices fell after the announcement after having been marginally higher in early trading. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON>, a market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the jump in the prime rate was not a surprise, but the announcement, coupled with higher oil prices today, cut into what little enthusiasm there had been on Wall Street.

<DATELINE>BAYS OF HUATULCO, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction crews labor seven days a week in the blazing sun along a tropical stretch of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coastline, building what the government hopes will be <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s resort paradise of the 21st century: <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION> `` It's as if the creator woke up one morning and went on a binge. <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION> is undoubtedly going to be the best,'' said Deputy Tourism Secretary <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON>, describing the resort's nine bays and white sand beaches in a recent interview. Only four years ago, <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION> was a sleepy, isolated settlement of 3,000 people, mostly peasant farmers and fishermen. Since then, the government has marshalled $ 185 million in private and public investment to build roads, a jetport, hotels, a marina and a city for a population that stands at 14,000 and growing rapidly. The resort was dedicated in a ceremony Nov. 6, while construction continues. <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION>, about 330 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is testament to the importance of tourism for a nation saddled with a $ 102 billion foreign debt. Tourism will earn <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> $ 2.5 billion this year, second only to oil. And <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s dependence on tourist spending is growing as it copes with sagging oil prices and economic crisis. Last year, 5.4 million foreigners vacationed in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, not counting some 60 million day-trippers across the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border. That was the highest number since 1984 and represented a victory of sorts for the government. Potential visitors had chosen other destinations after the September 1985 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> earthquake and the highly-publicized murder of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug enforcement agent earlier that year. With the slogan, `` Feel the Warmth of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' the government launched an aggressive marketing campaign in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and European to bring them back. About 5.7 million visitors are expected for 1988, a record year, though fewer than the 6 million anticipated before Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and the paralyzing bankruptcy of the government-owned airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s strike in September caused $ 86 million in structural damages and another $ 125 million in lost tourist earnings in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resorts of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Isla </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujeres </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>. The three attractions account for 25 percent of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s tourism income. <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy in April left the government-sponsored resorts of <LOCATION> Cabo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Loreto </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> without air service. Only this fall did a regional carrier restore a mainland connection to <LOCATION> Cabo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Loreto </LOCATION> is still unserved. `` The single most severe impact on tourism this year,'' is how <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> described the <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> fiasco. Still, he exuded optimism about the future of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s tourism sector. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is blessed with pluses: It has 6,000 miles of coastline, an ideal climate, raw natural beauty and a people whose nature is basically friendly,'' he said. The full project here is expected to take 30 years to complete. By the end, the government hopes, <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION> alone will attract 2 million visitors spending $ 1 billion a year. Following <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cabo </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Loreto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ixtapa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION> is the latest major resort complex to be developed under a master plan implemented by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, or Fonatur. The tiny government agency is the driving force behind <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s bid to become <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s No. 1 tourist destination. By combining government funds, foreign and domestic private financing and arranging debt-for-equity swaps, <ORGANIZATION> Fonatur </ORGANIZATION> has attracted $ 260 million in private investment in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s tourism infrastructure over the past six years. The agency financed 75 percent of the 75,000 new hotel rooms built in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the past decade and sponsored the remodeling of another 12,000. In <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fonatur </ORGANIZATION> pitched in $ 65 million to install infrastructure and induce private investment. It arranged debt swaps to partially finance construction of a $ 31.5 million Hotel Sheraton and the luxury Veramar Hotel, both due to open next year. A $ 35 million, 550-room Club Med nestled alongside <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tangolunda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> opened this year Together, the three hotels are expected to attract about 100,000 visitors in 1989, 80 percent of them from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION> _ and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> _ also stand to benefit from a civil aviation agreement initialed by Mexican and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities in September, increasing the number of air routes from 45 to 120 and permitting more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charter flights to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is expected to begin flights to <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION> next spring and other American carriers are expected to follow suit. The prospect of increased tourism means more jobs for a Mexican work force that is growing by 1 million people each year. <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> estimates that tourism directly employs 700,000 Mexicans and indirectly provides income for 2 million. When completed, <ORGANIZATION> Huatulco </ORGANIZATION> will employ 50,000 people and support a local population of 200,000, the government says. `` We're most proud of the fantastic capacity of tourism to provide jobs,'' <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has come away from the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> bargaining table a winner _ thanks to <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON>. Coming into the crucial talks on production and pricing, the Iranian oil minister was expected to play a critical role in sorting out the opposing interests of his country and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which recently declared a cease-fire after an 8-year-long war. In the end, <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> surprised observers with his keen negotiating skills in helping reach Monday's agreement, which reduces the cartel's production from 22.5 million to 18.5 million barrels a day and gives <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> equal quotas of 2.64 million barrels. The accord also maintains the cartel's target price of $ 18 per barrel. `` He was the most political and most skilled maneuverer,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzian </PERSON>, editor of the Paris-based oil publication Petrostrategies. <PERSON> Bahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Karbassioun </PERSON>, an oil consultant based in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, said, `` I think it's the best deal he could have gotten.'' Other ministers wanted <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> brought back into <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s quota system. The soft-spoken <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON>, a former newspaper editor, was key to that goal. `` They got more than what they could have imagined before -LRB- the meeting -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Terzian </PERSON> of the agreement signed by all 13 members of the Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries. The 39-year-old <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> _ a slight, bespectacled man with prematurely graying hair and beard _ hardly looks the part of a tough bargainer. Dressed modestly in a plain white shirt buttoned to the top, no tie and dark overcoat, the Iranian gives the impression of being a humble man. `` He is not what one would term a hot-headed man,'' said <PERSON> Karbassioun </PERSON>. `` He's very level-headed. He's steadfast in his political beliefs,'' he said. `` He's in no way what one would call an extremist.'' `` He's too intelligent not to be realistic,'' said <PERSON> Terzian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> was active in the Islamic revolution that ousted the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in January 1979, analysts say. `` He's a product of the Iranian revolution,'' said <PERSON> Karbassioun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON>, who holds a bachelor of science degree in computer sciences, was a founding member of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, according to a biographical sketch. He was editor-in-chief of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> newspaper from 1979-1982 and was deputy to the prime minister from 1981 to 1985. He has been oil minister since 1985. Because of his revolutionary background, <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> differs from other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers, some of whom are from royal families. `` He has both the political ability and also the logic of a computer engineer,'' <PERSON> Terzian </PERSON> noted. To get the agreement, which takes effect Jan. 1 for six months, <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> gave up what he insisted he would never do _ allow hated rival <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> the same production quota as that of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> want more money from their valuable resource to help rebuild their war-damaged economies. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had been demanding the same ceiling for years. It refused to join the previous accord, fashioned in 1986, because it was only given a quota of 1.5 million barrels, instead of the same 2.4 million alloted <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> vowed he would never permit the two countries to have the same quota. Some delegates whispered he would resign instead. `` I always reject parity,'' he insisted to reporters. In the end he bowed to the Iraqi demand, but also raised his country's own quota. He also was successful in pressing for the lower total production level set for the cartel and the $ 18 target price. `` He lost to the Iraqis; I do n't think he lost to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION>. Moreover, <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> succeeded in maintaining <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s share of total output at 14.27 percent. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was bumped up to the same level after other countries agreed to give up some of their share. `` He got a lot for -LRB- giving up parity -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, an oil analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` That's lot of concessions ... at the cost of giving up some political points,'' he said. In addition to demonstrating negotiating skills, <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> also was adept at telling his side of the story. He was one of the few ministers who would stop to answer reporters' questions after attending closed-door discussions. Several times, he was mobbed by reporters, even getting hit in the head once by a swinging tape recorder.

 Share prices closed lower Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, still depressed by dismal British trade figures Friday and a subsequent hike in the key domestic interest rate to 13 percent. `` Quite frankly, the market is still shell-shocked,'' one dealer said. Late-afternoon news that major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks raised their prime lending rates to 10.5 percent from 10 percent came as `` another hit on the head to market sentiment,'' another dealer said. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down 13.2 points, or 0.7 percent, at 1,781.5. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was down 9.7 points at 1,452.9 at the close. Volume was a modest 421.4 million shares, down sharply from 744.8 million shares on Friday. `` The only business around today was selling-related,'' one dealer said. On Friday, the government announced that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s current-account trade deficit more than quadrupled in October to a record 2.43 billion pounds, or around $ 4.5 billion Soon after the report was released, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> sent a signal to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s commercial banks to increase their base lending rate a full percentage point Those developments sent stock prices plummeting Friday, with the 100-share index falling more than 50 points before recovering some of its losses. On Monday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was 5.16 points lower at 2,069.52 when the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading session came to an end, having opened about 5 points higher. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stocks managed to ignore Wall Street for most of the afternoon but found it impossible to shrug off the prime rate hike news, dealers said. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index fell 9.62 points to close at 1,007.52.

 Stock prices were narrowly mixed in light trading today as Wall Street took an increase in the prime lending rate in stride. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 7.29 to 2,081.97 by 3 p.m. EST. Among broader indicators, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index of all listed issues was up 0.56 to 151.19. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market-value index rose 0.49 to 291.68. Decliners ran about even with advancing issues on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, with 708 stocks falling, 673 rising and 532 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> volume was light, with 104.74 million shares changing hands with one hour of trading left. The market fluctuated in a narrow range, opening higher but then falling after the nation's biggest banks said they were increasing their prime interest rates to 10.5 percent from 10 percent. The increase, effective immediately, pushes the base lending rate to its highest level since May 1985, when it was lowered a half percentage point to 10 percent. Today's increase was the fourth in the prime rate this year. Analysts had been expecting a prime hike due to the steady increase of interest rates in the credit markets in recent weeks. <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON>, a market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the market had anticipated an increase in the prime, so today's announcement did little damage on Wall Street.

 Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks boosted their prime lending rates a half percentage point to 10.5 percent Monday, the steepest level since mid-1985 and the fourth rise this year. The increase will mean a jump in rates on a variety of consumer loans pegged to the prime, including home-equity loans. It lso will raise borrowing costs for companies that rely on banks for financing. Economists had been predicting a prime rate increase because interest rates in the bond markets had risen recently due to inflation fears and the dollar's weakness in foreign exchange markets. The financial markets had no major reaction to the announcement. Stock and bond prices were up modestly, while the dollar steadied against other major currencies. `` It comes as no surprise. In fact, they -LRB- banks -RRB- seem to have held back longer than I expected,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, chief economist for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> also has warned of higher short-term rates unless the government trims its huge budget deficit, the source of the dollar's woes `` There's a building perception in the marketplace that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is, in fact, tightening conditions ...,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, an economist for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and other economists predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might soon raise its discount rate, or the interest it charges on loans to member banks If that happened, the prime rate could be increased again, they said. `` I'd look for something -LRB- from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in the next two weeks,'' said <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Manhattan </PERSON> was the first institution to increase its prime rate Monday and other major banks quickly joined the move. The prime stood at 8.5 percent at the start of the year and has been raised four times since. Monday's increase put the key lending rate at its highest level since May 20, 1985, when it was lowered a half percentage point to 10 percent. The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money, including interest it pays on on savings accounts or certificates of deposit, and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates. But the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans. Mortgage rates are not included in that category. `` It's clear that consumers will be absorbing higher borrowing costs in December or early next year,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. Economists were uncertain as to what effect the latest increase would have on the economy, and more specifically on consumers' spending during the holiday season <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kochan </PERSON>, chief fixed-income strategist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I think the direct effect is pretty small because generally consumers are n't affected by modest increass in interest rates ...'' But <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> said some credit-happy consumers might want to cut back on spending and `` buy only things that they can afford.'' `` There's an underlying sense of uneasiness because so many people have been through rough times even when the economy was strong. The prime rate hike coming into the Christmas season may make people more cautious,'' he said.

The grain markets had rallied strongly last week in anticipation of a grain pact, and Monday's activity was a classic example of `` buy the rumor, sell the fact,'' analysts said. `` We've been going up and up and up on -LRB- expectations for -RRB- this deal and now we've finally got it,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Court To Referee Railroad Dispute Over Selling Lines, Reducing
Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it would referee a railroad industry dispute affecting the ability of railroads to sell off their lines and reduce their work forces. Separately, the justices allowed prosecutors investigating labor union corruption in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to use subpoenaed membership lists obtained from four carpenters union locals. The high court said it would hear a case involving the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Erie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to resolve issues troubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide. At issue is the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to exempt railroads from collective bargaining when they sell rail lines. A key related question involves the authority of federal courts to block strikes in such cases. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration supported the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION>'s plea that the court settle the issues, which have generated disagreement among lower courts. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last year the <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; LE may not sell 182 miles of rail line in western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Ohion </LOCATION> without engaging in collective bargaining. The appeals court said the federal Railway Labor Act requires the railorad to bargain with the unions over the effects the proposed sale would have in eliminating jobs. The appeals court also ruled that federal courts lack authority to block a strike by the workers. The appeals court said federal law deprives federal judges of the power to bar strikes in such circumstances. The appeals court rejected the railroad's arguments that the act may be set aside in cases where the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> has approved proposed rail line sales. The financially troubled P & amp; LE announced in July 1987 it would sell its rail lines to a newly formed company that planned to operate the lines with fewer workers. The <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> approved the plan without requiring the railroad to engage in collective bargaining with its unions, which then called a strike in September 1987. P & amp; LE currently is seeking a new purchaser for the lines other than the newly formed company, called <ORGANIZATION> Railco </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> adopted a process to streamline sales by relieving railroads of any obligation to bargain with employees. Also Monday, the high court rejected an appeal by labor unions in a related action that challenged the sale of 208 miles of track between <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, by <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In the carpenters union case, the court let stand without comment a ruling that the rights of the union and its members were not violated by forcing the locals to turn over the lists. A <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> grand jury in February 1987 issued subpoenas for the membership lists of the locals in connection with a probe of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carpenters </ORGANIZATION> and Joiners by District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last July <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>'s office could keep the lists pending completion of the grand jury investigation. The state court said forcing the unions to turn over the lists and allowing the district attorney to keep them for now did not violate free-association rights of the union and its members.

<HEAD>Asbestos Maker Out of Bankruptcy Court After Six Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Building-products giant <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> emerged from more than six years of protection under federal bankruptcy court Monday and began paying creditors and asbestos health and property claimants. `` With the constraints of bankruptcy behind us, we can now dedicate all of our attention to growing <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> and creating shareholder value,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said in officially marking what the company considers the first day of the rest of its life. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy law Aug. 26, 1982, saying it faced ruin from billions of dollars in suits claiming health problems from asbestos once produced by the company. Its refuge in bankruptcy court marked one of the biggest and most exhaustive filings in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history and raised major questions about use of the federal bankruptcy laws to defer or avoid health-related liability claims. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> helped lay the precedent for another major company, <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, to seek Chapter 11 protection when it felt threatened by billions of dollars in escalating health claims for a now-discontinued controversial product, the Dalkon Shield intrauterine birth-control device. The <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy contributed to the company's tarnished image over the handling of asbestos claims, and some surveys called it one of the least admired <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses. Before its Chapter 11 filing, property damage claims alone had come to $ 85 billion, or about 40 times the company's total assets. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> also faced more than 17,000 personal injury claims in the billions of dollars. The filing allowed <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> to operate shielded from liability suits while it worked out a way to pay the bills. It also allowed the company time to draft a $ 2.5 billion trust-fund plan to pay asbestos victims. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization plan was approved by the bankruptcy court in December 1986. Following several appeals, the final order implementing the plan was given Oct. 28, to become effective in 30 days. The plan has been both praised and condemned. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> shareholders will be the big losers, winding up with one share of new <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> stock for every eight shares they once held, said <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crary </PERSON>, a litigation analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simpson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment research firm. `` Basically, they wiped out their shareholders. I'm disgusted with the way <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> conducted itself,'' <PERSON> Crary </PERSON> said recently. He accused <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> of `` gross abdication of fiduciary responsibility to shareholders.'' But <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, who took control of the company a few years ago and is widely credited with helping steer it through the final stages of bankruptcy, said the plan protects shareholders by restoring the company's financial health while at the same time addressing the asbestos claims problem. The reorganization plan established a Personal Injury Settlement Trust to settle claims of asbestos health victims for the next 25 years. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 150 million into the trust and its insurers will add $ 615 million. Beginning in 1991, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> will make annual payments to the trust of $ 75 million until 2012. A second trust, called the <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Damage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Settlement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, would settle asbestos-related property claims. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 100 million cash into it and the company's insurance carriers also will contribute millions of dollars. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> also faces immediate cash obligations of $ 247.5 million to commercial creditors. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> said that as of the close of business Monday, trading of its old securities ceased. The new securities will trade under the symbol MVL. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> reported a $ 164 million profit on $ 2.06 billion in sales last year. Today, the business consists of three parts: a fiberglass group, which produces insulation products and glass fibers; a forest group, producing wood and paper items; and a specialty products gorup, making goods ranging from commercial-industrial lighting to filter materials for the beer and wine industries. Founded in 1858 as <ORGANIZATION> Johns-Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the firm was built into an industry leader in the early 1900s as a manufacturer of asbestos, the fibrous mineral once heavily used in insulation and fireproofing materials. It was incorporated under the shortened name in 1981. The company's troubles began in the early 1970s when asbestos was linked to a number of serious, often fatal diseases, including lung cancer and asbestosis.

 The dollar advanced Monday in a rally that some traders attributed to an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement on production cuts and an increase in the prime rate by major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to set a daily production quota of 18.5 million barrels and a target price of $ 18 a barrel. The announcement triggered a $ 1-a-barrel increase in oil prices. The biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks raised their prime lending rates a half percentage point to 10.5 percent, the fourth increase this year. Some analysts said the dollar's rise was hard to explain because the prime rate increase had been widely expected and an increase in oil prices usually does not give a big boost to the dollar. But there were no other ready explanations for the dollar's ascent. `` It's a fairly impressive move by the dollar,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, a currency analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.

 <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced plans Monday to put its consulting practice on an equal footing with its better-known accounting business in hopes of stemming a flow of defections to other consulting firms. `` More equal is probably a good way to put it,'' said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kullberg </PERSON>, managing partner and chief executive officer of Chicago-based <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accounting firm and a leader in information-management consulting. The announcement of the proposed corporate restructuring ended speculation that <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> would split off or sell its consulting practice, a 40-year-old unit that is the fastest-growing segment of the 75-year-old firm. <PERSON> Kullberg </PERSON> told a news conference that <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s 2,200 partners would vote in early January on a task force's recommendation to restructure the company along two lines: consulting and audit-and-tax accounting. Each line would be headed by a chief operating officer who would report to the CEO. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> currently has one chief operating officer overseeing three divisions _ consulting, auditing and tax accounting _ with each division headed by its own managing partner. Consulting partners have complained of being relegated to second-class status by the accounting partners who traditionally have controlled the company _ and the purse strings. <PERSON> Kullberg </PERSON> said a new incentive program offering substantial bonuses for exemplary work would increase the pay of <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s best consultants and help to keep them from looking elsewhere. `` It is intended to be an incentive system that will address that particular question,'' he said. Four of <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s top consulting partners left the firm in October to join <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company headed by two other former <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> consultants that was formed with financial backing from London-based <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest advertising company. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> has filed a lawsuit in state court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> accusing its departed consulting partners and <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> of trying to force <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> to sell at least part of its consulting business. The change in <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s corporate structure will not affect the lawsuit, <PERSON> Kullberg </PERSON> said. `` We intend to pursue that lawsuit vigorously, without question,'' he said. <PERSON> Kullberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> hoped to move beyond its frequent categorization as an accounting firm by promoting itself as an accounting-and-consulting company. Of the company's $ 2.8 billion in revenues in fiscal 1988, audit and consulting work each brought in 40 percent while tax work accounted for 20 percent. <PERSON> Kullberg </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> was exploring options for increasing its capital base but he ruled out the possibility of going public.

 Prices were little changed in quiet trading on Wall Street Monday after major banks raised their prime lending rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.76 to 2,081.44. Advancing issues were about even with decliners in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 710 issues up, 726 down and 521 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 123.48 million shares, up from 72.09 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 145.26 million shares. The market moved in a narrow range, opening marginally higher and then dipping after the nation's largest banks said they were increasing their prime interest rates to 10.5 percent from 10 percent. The increase, effective immediately, pushes the base lending rate to its highest level since May 1985, when it was lowered a half percentage point to 10 percent. The increase was the fourth in the prime rate this year. Wall Street was expecting the increase after interest rates crept upward in credit markets recently, so the banks' announcement had no major effect on prices. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, called Monday's session `` inconclusive,'' and said countervailing forces in the market left prices little changed. `` On one side of the coin we have a deep oversold condition and a market that is very underbelieved,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. Ordinarily, that would move prices higher, but negative influences such as rising interest rates were holding stocks in check, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> said. Investors also were wary because of economic reports due out this week, in particular Tuesday's scheduled release of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s revised estimate of third-quarter growth in the gross national product. `` The market is responding in a very uncertain, indecisive way,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. Most of the change in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average was due to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, which rose 2 ~ to close at 118 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said it would disclose on Tuesday its resolution of a software copyright dispute between <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s biggest computer company <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 to 89 as speculators bid up the food-and-tobacco giant's stock on the hunch that fattened offers would emerge in the auction for the company.

<HEAD>Oil, Platinum Futures Soar On OPEC Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement to cut oil production sent energy and platinum futures soaring Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but other precious metals posted only moderate gains. On other markets, grain, soybean and coffee futures fell sharply; cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mostly lower; and stock-index futures advanced. West Texas Intermediate crude oil for delivery in January soared as high as $ 15.80 a barrel in early trading on news of the agreement among oil ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. But a statement from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> later in the day that it did not consider its new production limit an official quota sparked some selling on fears that the fragile <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement could come undone, analysts said. Still, nearly all energy-futures contracts advanced their daily trading limits _ $ 1 a barrel for crude oil and 2 cents a gallon for heating oil and gasoline. The contracts for near-month delivery have no limits. <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> crude settled $ 1 to $ 1.06 higher with January at $ 15.03 a barrel; heating oil was 2 cents to 2.93 cents higher with December at 48.65 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.91 cents to 2 cents higher with December at 46.37 cents a gallon. The deal signed by all 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members reestablishes a crude-oil target price of $ 18 a barrel and reduces production from the current estimated 22.5 million barrels a day to 18.5 million barrels. Monday's price gains indicated a belief among market players that the chances of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members abiding by their new production limits were `` a little better than 50-50,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, an oil-market analyst with E.D. & amp; <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` If you go back to 1987, during the first half of that year there was a general adherence to the quota,'' <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said. `` But as we know from the second half of this year, they have also had problems adhering to a quota.'' The prospect of higher oil prices triggered a rally in the inflation-sensitive precious-metals markets Monday but only platinum managed to hold sharp gains into the close. Platinum settled $ 14.90 to $ 15.70 higher with January at $ 586.70 a troy ounce. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which, like the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, was closed Thursday through Sunday for Thanksgiving, gold settled $ 3.10 to $ 3.80 higher with December at $ 423.30 a troy ounce; silver settled 2 cents to 5.9 cents higher with December at $ 6.115 a troy ounce. Platinum's move was more `` realistic'' than gold's, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, considering the firming of energy prices and the relatively tight warehouse stocks of both metals. New York-based analyst <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the dollar's strength on Monday may have helped limit the gains in gold and silver. But <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said the dollar's surge appeared to be a short-term reaction to the sudden rise in energy prices. `` I would look for the dollar to come off if this oil price holds and for gold to go higher,'' he said. Grain and soybean futures fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on profit-taking following the announcement of a new multi-year grain deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The grain markets had rallied strongly last week, including modest gains on Friday, in anticipation of a grain pact. Monday's activity was a classic example of `` buy the rumor, sell the fact,'' analysts said The 27-month extension signed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> revived a 5-year pact that expired Sept. 30, calling for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to buy at least 9 million metric tons of grain a year from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Wheat settled 2 -LCB- cents to 7 cents lower with December at $ 4.18 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 3 -RCB- cents to 7 -RCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.57 \ a bushel; oats were 10 cents lower across the board with December at $ 2.05 a bushel; soybeans were 12 \ cents to 16 \ cents lower with January at $ 7.49 -LCB- Coffee futures plunged on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on weakening technical signals, analysts said. Coffee settled 1.15 cents to 3.33 cents lower with March at $ 1.2251 a pound. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, live cattle settled .18 cent to .48 cent lower with December at 73.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .33 cent lower to .15 cent higher with January at 82.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent lower to .30 cent higher with December at 39.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .47 cent higher with February at 42.92 cents a pound. Stock-index futures advanced modestly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 settled 1.60 points higher at 268.95. Each point is worth $ 500.

<HEAD>Plans To Divest 25 Brands, Close Plant, Eliminate Administrative
Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced plans Monday to drop 25 non-premium liquor brands it markets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, close its <LOCATION> Dundalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, plant and eliminate 240 mostly administrative jobs. The company, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said it was divesting the 25 brands so it could concentrate its production and marketing resources on its more profitable, nationally distributed premium brands <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> said it would discontinue production and sales of three brands, cease acting as sales agent for four brands it does not own and relinquish <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rights to 18 others, some of which <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> will continue to market in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and other international markets. The brands to be phased out represent about 8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distilled spirits case sales and about 4 percent of its earnings from that business. The phaseout will leave it with 23 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brands. The planned closing of the <LOCATION> Dundalk </LOCATION> plant, which employs 300 people, will begin sometime after June 1 and be completed by the end of 1990, <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the operations at <LOCATION> Dundalk </LOCATION>, where various distilled spirits are made, will be transferred and consolidated into other <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, principally the facility at Relay, Md. <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> said it had not been determined how many of those jobs may be lost and how many employees will be offered transfers to other plants. The company said its decision to eliminate the 240 positions, most of them administrative, resulted from a review begun several months ago of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations. <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> employs about 3,600 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It said that of the positions being eliminated, 78 are vacant and 91 will involve separations through July 31. The remainder will be eliminated through attrition, the company said.

In return, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> sweetened its previous hostile offer by about $ 200 million by slightly increasing the stock portion of the bid and adding stock warrants.

<HEAD>Trade Battle Looms over Hormones in Meat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> have decided against having talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week to explore prospects for averting a trade battle over the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s scheduled Jan. 1 ban of meat from animals treated with growth hormones. `` They just saw the Americans the weekend before last and they'll see them again in another week,'' said <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Krucoff </PERSON>, speaking for the community's delegation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers stand to lose meat sales which totaled about $ 169 million last year in the 12 EEC nations, and administration officials say President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could retaliate with restrictions against the sale of European meat products, or even some industrial products, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolfa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the value of the European meat exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is higher, because they include high quality items like Danish ham. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, on the other hand, includes a large quantity of cheaper cuts such as hearts and kidneys, she said. The use of hormones to speed animal growth is forbidden in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s member nations, which include <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. However, there have been widespread reports of illegal use of hormones by European producers and Ms. <PERSON> Stolfa </PERSON> suggested it could be appropriate to delay the import ban while the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> completes an investigation already in progress. Earlier Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said imminent talks were possible in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> would be represented by <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, a Belgian in charge of external affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Netherlander </LOCATION> and top agricultural official. But they apparently decided to wait for a meeting in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, beginning Dec. 5, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> are due to review trade issues with representatives of nearly 100 nations. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the hormones used on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cattle do not leave residues that are harmful to humans. He said scientists in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have supported the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has proposed that international decisions on the safety of hormones be entrusted to the <ORGANIZATION> Codex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alimentarius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> body with 129 governments as members.

 Transportation giant <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has agreed to pay more than $ 175 million to settle an antitrust suit brought by pipeline <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, ending a longstanding legal dispute. <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> had claimed <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern unlawfully blocked construction of a proposed coal pipeline from the <LOCATION> Powder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> said $ 100 million cash would be paid to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Dec. 1, and deferred payments of $ 25 million plus interest on each of Dec. 1, 1989, 1990 and 1991 to the firm. A smaller settlement with another plaintiff in the suit, <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, involves future rate adjustments. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, assistant vice president for corporate affairs, said the settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> would be much less than the larger settlement but declined to provide a figure. He also said <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> believed it had a good case but settlement was prudent because damages in a federal jury trial could have amounted to nearly $ 1 billion, with an award amount tripling that figure because it was an antitrust action. `` We believe this is a very positive development,'' he said. `` It will not impair the financial capability of the company.'' BN stock was up $ 1.75 to $ 74.75 Monday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The lawsuit was over a project proposed in the 1970s that would have sent coal on a line 1,400 miles from northeastern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> to utilities in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The coal would be crushed to a fine powder and carried in a water slurry, then dried and burned in power plants.

 Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> on Monday asked the trustee for a $ 38 billion state pension fund to halt further investments in corporate takeovers until a task force can determine if such deals hurt the state economy. The Democratic governor appointed a 20-member task force to study the issue and also Republican Comptroller <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s role as sole trustee of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Common Retirement Fund. The Common Retirement Fund has $ 1 billion earmarked toward firms involved in buyouts and $ 450 million actually committed, according to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s economic development director, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Tese </PERSON>. The bulk of the investments are with the buyout firms <ORGANIZATION> Forstman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nailor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> is involved in the multibillion-dollar battle to acquire over <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>. The firm's role in the proposed buyout already has been criticized by some of its other big institutional investors, who claim some of their existing bond investments have declined in value because of the huge amounts of new bonds needed to finance <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> deal. <PERSON> Tese </PERSON> called on <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> to impose a moratorium on further investments in buyout firms until the task force issues its findings in four months. <PERSON> Tese </PERSON> said he feared that many of these buyouts lead to job cuts at the companies involved. `` The task force will examine the widespread concern about the role of public pension funds in takeovers, which put our major corporations deep into debt, and often exclude the interests of bondholders and employees,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> called the study `` interesting,'' but suggested that finding ways to close the state's $ 2 billion budget deficit was more important. <PERSON> Nailor </PERSON> said the comptroller was considering <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s suggestion for a moratorium The task force, which will be headed by <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Keilin </PERSON>, a partner in the investment banking firm of <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freres </ORGANIZATION>, also includes <PERSON> Tese </PERSON>; <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s chief counsel, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>; and budget director, <PERSON> Dall </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON>, who has been in charge of the <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> administration's efforts to cut the budget deficit The state's other two public employees pension funds, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Employees Retirement System and the State Teachers Retirement Fund, do n't invest in firms conducting takeovers, <PERSON> Tese </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> long has advocated that state pension decisions be made by a special board and not just the comptroller. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> also has supported creation of a pension board, but the comptroller's proposal would allow him to appoint the panel's members <PERSON> Tese </PERSON> said recent allegations about a possible link between <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s political fundraising apparatus and his official duties had nothing to do with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s renewed call to limit the comptroller's power <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing.
