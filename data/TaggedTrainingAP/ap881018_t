<HEAD>Queen in Spain On First Visit Ever By British Monarch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> paid homage to Spanish war dead, addressed parliament and accepted the keys to the capital Tuesday during a busy second day of her visit to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the first ever by a reigning <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> monarch. The queen, in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> on a five-day visit, told a joint session of parliament that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> would play important roles in the future development of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. She praised <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for 10 years of democracy following nearly four decades under the authoritarian regime of Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>. In her speech, which received a standing ovation, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> did not mention the British colony of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, the only major political dispute between the two countries. On Monday night, both the British monarch and her third cousin and Spanish host, King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>, said they believed the two countries would eventually resolve their differences over the colony that guards the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> entrance to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> seeks sovereignty over <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, which it ceded to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> by treaty in 1713 after losing the War of Spanish Succession. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has said <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> will remain British unless its 30,000 inhabitants decide otherwise. Earlier Tuesday a small but enthusiastic crowd waving <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> flags applauded as the queen and her husband, the Duke of <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, placed a laurel wreath at a memorial to `` those who gave their lives for <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> then went to City Hall to accept the keys to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> from Mayor <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barranco </PERSON>. The visit brought normally heavy traffic in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> to a standstill as police blocked off streets along the motorcade's route The queen's visit is to include trips to <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Escorial </LOCATION>, a palace built in the foothills of the <LOCATION> Guadarrama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> by King <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. The royal couple were also to spend two days on a private visit with <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Majorca </LOCATION>.

 An undercover policeman was shot and killed during a drug buy and a patrolman was slain while responding to a medical emergency in separate incidents Tuesday night, police said. The undercover officer was shot in the head and chest at 7:11 p.m. as he and another undercover officer tried to buy a gram of cocaine at an apartment just west of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. In a gunfight that followed, a drug suspect was killed, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> told a news conference. A second suspect was arrested as he fled the building and a third eluded police. The second officer was shot in the chest and stomach at 9:45 p.m. as he and his partner were getting out of their patrol car in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> while responding to a medical emergency, said Officer <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Conde </LOCATION>, a police spokeswoman. Both of the officers died at hospitals, said Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, a police spokesman. The dead policemen's identities were not released. In the first shooting, two men escorted the officers to the apartment to buy drugs from a third man, and one of the three accused the officers of being undercover police, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. One of the three pulled out a .357 - caliber handgun and shot the After the gunfight that ensued, the other officer ran into the street and alerted backup police. The officer slain in the drug case was 26 years old and had been a member of the force since 1984, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> at the news conference, called the shooting `` an enormous tragedy. The partner -LRB- is -RRB- terribly shaken. It's really overwhelming.'' The officers had been attempting to carry out a buy-and-bust raid, in which police purchase drugs from suspects, then arrest them.

<HEAD>APME President Urges Editors: Fight Campaign Attempts To Manage

<TEXT>
 Newspapers must fight attempts by presidential campaigns to orchestrate the news in hopes of getting good television coverage, says the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Managing Editors association. `` The most important journalism in this campaign is being delivered by the reporters who are going in after the candidates have been there and are talking to voters about impressions of the candidates and about the real problems of their regions,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giles </PERSON>, vice president and executive editor of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> APME </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, the first day of its annual convention. He told the newspaper editors: ` My premise is that newspaper editors are allowing television news directors and the campaign strategists for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to influence their Page 1 agendas.'' `` As a result,'' he added, `` we are the targets of criticism about biased or frivolous coverage that is more appropriately the fault of television.'' <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> suggested newspapers rely on wire services for much of the day-to-day campaign coverage, and concentrate on providing readers with `` issues stories.'' On the wide perception that the current campaign has been especially negative, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mears </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> vice president and executive editor, said contests in the 1960s, such as the Goldwater-Johnson race in 1964, were no less strident or less shaped by image-makers. `` We, meaning the people who report the campaign, have been telling the voters this is a campaign of sound bites, crafted by handlers and interpreted by spin-control specialists,'' he said. `` Those buzzwords make it sound as though these were all 1988 creations. I do n't think there's anything unique about it.'' More than 600 editors from around the country are attending the week-long annual convention. The AP, the largest newsgathering organization in the world, serves 1,467 daily newspapers. In his address to the editors, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> President and General Manager <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> said the wire service is in the midst of its most extensive modernization in its photography, financial and technical delivery services. `` As our periodic announcements may have suggested to you, we are in the midst of the most thorough and concentrated rebuilding and modernizing of AP services that has been attempted in modern times,'' <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> said. Editors also heard presentations from <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> editors on developments in news and photography distribution, and discussions of changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its press. <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON>, a Soviet economist who collaborated with <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> on a book about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, told the editors that economic change is meeting some resistance from the Soviet bureaucracy. `` They still control most of the economy and make economic change a fiction and not a fact,'' <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fears of communism and Soviet fears of capitalism have abated in recent years. `` We live in a time when both of those fears have evaporated, except on the paranoiac right,'' he said. At a session on the Soviet press, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalnev </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, said Soviet newspapers reacted to greater press freedom with more negative stories about their country and more positive ones on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He cited an `` upsurge in the inclination to write as many negative things as we could find out'' and said the boundaries on what is acceptable still are being defined. At a panel discussion on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyhan </PERSON>, political columnist for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, advised the visiting editors to `` watch where you walk and how you drive.'' `` Driving is the most dangerous thing you can do in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, even more than taking advice from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Judson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> magazine, said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s greatest export is its conscience `` The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> conscience never kept anyone from doing anything, but it does keep you from enjoying it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lashed at front-running <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a man with `` no convictions, no ideas and no plans'' Tuesday and blamed Republican policies for last year's stock market plunge. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to contain supporters' enthusiasm over polls showing him building a large lead. `` We're not going to lighten up,'' the Republican presidential nominee said while campaigning in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. `` No votes can be taken for granted and I'm not taking any votes for granted. I will continue to campaign as an underdog.'' There was no question who was the real underdog _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But he drew enthusiastic crowds as he campaigned through <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> with aides battling the growing perception that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had taken an insurmountable lead with just three weeks until the election. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> delivered a strongly worded response to the Republicans, accusing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of running `` one of the most outrageous displays of negative campaigning ever seen in the history of national politics.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor sharpened his language as he focused on economic issues and portrayed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the candidate of the wealthy. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cares about he people on Easy Street,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I care about the people on Main Street. He's on their side. I'm on your side.'' `` <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>,'' chanted the crowds. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also brought up the huge stock-market drop that occurred one year ago Wednesday. `` The trade deficit had soared,'' he said. `` Republican policies of borrow and spend and borrow and spend had done the damage.'' He pledged to eliminate the $ 150 billion trade deficit in four years by reducing the budget deficit, increasing foreign trade, investing in education and putting more emphasis on research. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would n't talk about his plans. `` He's got the flags and balloons, but no convictions, no ideas and no plans,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The Democrat's aides disputed an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a 17-point lead, his largest of the campaign. They pointed instead to other polls indicating about half that margin. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, trying to avoid overconfidence, campaigned in <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and invoked the memory of <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churchill </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> delivered his 1946 `` iron curtain'' speech warning of Soviet expansionism in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the demarcation between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is now `` a rusting curtain.'' He said that if elected he would be wary of Soviet intentions, despite what he called more enlightened leadership under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Now is not the time to abandon realism about what moves the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign began airing tough new television commercials that ridicule <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and say he has `` opposed virtually every defense system we developed.'' The ad uses videotape of the helmeted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the turret of an M-1 tank, a ride the Democrat took in September in an attempt to show toughness on defense issues _ but which critics said made him look silly. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Voles </PERSON> called the ad `` more distortions from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign dispatched dozens of workers from his national headquarters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> into the field, along with more than 1,300 new volunteers from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The campaign said 60 percent of the headquarters staff was being assigned to campaign duties in target states. Among the other volunteers are students, congressional aides and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorneys taking leaves for the final three weeks of the campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday without attribution that in addition the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has requested time from <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> for five 30-minute programs and hopes to air the shows at the same time on each network. The newspaper said the plan would cost about $ 5 million. Public polls ranged from bad to worse for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, though his aides pointed to what they said was a new <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll putting the gap at 9 points. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Winokur </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> would release a poll Wednesday but declined to comment on its results in advance. Two other surveys found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leads of about that size. One, of 1,002 registered voters polled Saturday through Monday, put the race at 49-39; another, of 1,201 likely voters Friday through Monday, put it at 49-40. Both were ongoing tracking polls _ in which the newest day's result is added to several days being covered and the oldest day's is dropped _ done by <ORGANIZATION> KRC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> @ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, They had three-point error margins. Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> traveled by bus caravan through small <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> towns, accompanied by Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he felt `` a special obligation ... to help <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> define the needs of a new generation of Americans, their challenges, their responses.'' `` With <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> you get experience,'' the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` With me you get the future, the future of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, denounced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` an utterly vicious onslaught of distortion and character assassination.'' He said the Democrats have `` been a little too flabbergasted sometimes to make a proper response.'' `` They do n't seem to mind if what they say is untrue,'' he said. `` They do n't seem to worry if it's misleading. They do n't seem to care that what they do is downright mean. If it sounds good, say it. If it sells, package it. If it looks good, nominate it.'' Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> discounted suggestions he has not worked hard enough for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his former rival for the Democratic nominamtion. `` No Democrat since <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has traveled more miles, spoken to more people and registered more Democrats for the ticket than I have,'' the Democratic runnerup said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> home.

 Insects believed to be African locusts have been discovered in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and are a threat to the island's agriculture, an agricultural official says. `` We are now making an intensive investigation as to the extent of the infestation,'' said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. `` We can not say anymore now but, if what we fear is true, there is a serious threat to the agricultural industry.'' The first sighting was made on Thursday. Since then there have been several reports of sightings of the insects on the island's east coast, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity A specimen of the insect at the Pest Control office of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> is about three inches long. The spokesman said it is not known how the insects came to <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, though he said they are believed to have been `` blown across from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' They have also been sighted on the neighboring island of <LOCATION> Carriacou </LOCATION>. Agricultural officials in <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> are studying the insects to determine their origin. The locusts appeared in large numbers on the island following heavy rains last week. The locusts have been seen flying around <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> but so far no swarm has been seen. There are unconfirmed reports of sightings also in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincent </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>.

 A gunman robbed a bank Tuesday, kidnapped the bank manager and drove off in the manager's car, only to be cornered by a police roadblock on an interstate, authorities said. The manager, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, 61, was freed about seven hours after police closed Interstate 176, a spur from Interstate 76 leading to Reading, said <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, a police communications operator. Negotiations with the gunmman continued late Tuesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said. A state police SWAT team and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> tactical team arrived at the scene six hours after the standoff began about 10 miles south of this southeast <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> city, said a <LOCATION> Berks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> dispatch supervisor who declined to give her name. A nearby access road was closed because traffic seemed to startle the gunman, the supervisor said. The suspect's brother was brought to the scene in an effort to persuade him to surrender, but the robber asked his brother to leave, said the supervisor. Police asked the suspect to exchange the bank manager for an officer, but he turned the offer down, authorities said. The man was armed with a 9mm pistol, said <ORGANIZATION> Amity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Eschbach </PERSON>, who questioned several witnesses to the robbery. The robber, identified by police only as a 29-year-old from the <LOCATION> Pottstown </LOCATION> area, took the manager hostage at 4 p.m. at the <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amity </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, according to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who spoke on condition of anonymity. Police believe less than $ 5,000 was taken, said the <LOCATION> Berks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> supervisor.

 <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>'s book is about a hippie-like New Age guru who allegedly killed his girlfriend and stuffed her in a trunk. <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>'s book is about a professor who battered his prostitute-mistress. When this husband and wife dine at night, does mayhem mingle with the meatloaf? Not necessarily, they say. `` It would be wrong to suggest -LRB- our conversations -RRB- were excessively morbid. They do n't tend to be morose,'' says <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> quickly adds, `` We could swap forensic stories and I could tell him who he should talk to in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.'' For three years, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, 37, and <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, 40, worked separately but simultaneously on these two accounts of similarly repulsive crimes. The experience of both writing at the same time turned out quite well, <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said during a recent interview at the couple's Fifth Avenue apartment, a well-lighted, book-filled home In his book _ `` The Unicorn's Secret: Murder in the Age of Aquarius,'' to be published this month by <ORGANIZATION> Prentice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> examined the bizarre case of <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Einhorn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s enigmatic peace-and-love freak and parapsychology crusader who was charged in 1979 with killing his girlfriend, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddux </PERSON> Eighteen months after <PERSON> Maddux </PERSON> was last seen alive, her decomposed, mummified body was found in a locked trunk in their apartment. <PERSON> Einhorn </PERSON>, known about town as `` The Unicorn,'' shrugged off the allegations and accused the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and others of planting evidence in his home, but he skipped bail before trial. He remains a fugitive, likely living in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>'s book, `` Missing Beauty,'' published in June by <PERSON> W.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, is the story of what led <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> medical researcher <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> in 1983 to smash the skull of <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>, the high-priced <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> prostitute with whom he'd fallen insanely in love. Even though the essentials of the stories are similar _ both victims were women trying to extract themselves from relationships with obsessively possessive men _ the two men could not be more unalike. The Unicorn was a brilliant and charismatic bear of a figure, a ladies' man extraordinaire and counterculture oddball given to such benign weirdness as answering his door stark naked. Though he dressed in a dashiki and dirty jeans, sported a full beard and shoulder-length hair and frequently smelled bad, <PERSON> Einhorn </PERSON> established an incredible global network of scientists, corporate sponsors and wealthy benefactors. `` Ira was the epitome of the guy who worked in fringe circles, was antiestablishment and still looked like a hippie when he was almost 40,'' says <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> was this traditional, respected man.'' Superficially, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> did appear to lead a normal life: He was a solidly middle-class family man with three children, an eminent medical school professor and acknowledged expert in cell culture. `` Everything about him was so normal, so stultifyingly normal. ... He was a man who one would never imagine could have gotten himself into a situation like this,'' <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said. But then there was that other side, sufficiently dark, private and perverse to fascinate the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for four years. Carpenter received the award in 1981 for her crime coverage for The Village Voice. Here was `` a scientist who had been embezzling research funds to support a mistress _ who happened to be a hooker. He was living a double life ... That's what hooked me,'' she said. Researching her book, <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> spent weeks walking the streets and hanging out in the bars and strip joints of the Combat Zone, the netherworld that is <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s red-light district, talking to bartenders, pimps, whores and strippers who knew <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' young victim. `` That was very difficult for me.

While <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> was exploring the gamy depths, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> was having anxieties of his own as he waited for her nightly call from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, assuring him that she was safe. `` I was n't happy about it, but this is what <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> does.

<HEAD>Portugal To Sink Grounded Ship and 5,400 Cars in Atlantic</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> will send a new but wrecked ship and its cargo of 5,400 Japanese cars to the bottom of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, whatever the outrage of ecologists, because `` no practical alternative is available.'' That was the comment of Adm. <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Horta </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Portuguese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION>, after returning last week from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where he reported on the case to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping. The 58,000-ton Reijin ran aground April 27 in shallow water off the northern city of <LOCATION> Oporto </LOCATION>, the first stop on its maiden voyage from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. One sailor was killed. <ORGANIZATION> Emerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipholding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese-owned Panamanian company to which the ship belongs, said July 13 the Reijin was not recoverable and assumed responsibility for the wreck's removal. The new cars must be scuttled because they could be unsafe to drive. <PERSON> Horta </PERSON> said the company insisted on sinking the ship and its $ 100-million cargo at sea and threatened to abandon the wreck if <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> refused to cooperate. That would leave the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> with disposal project costing millions of dollars. Environmentalists in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and elsewhere say the 173 tons of copper and lead, 115 tons of paint, 28 tons of oil and more than 1,000 tons of rubber, plastic and textiles could seriously damage marine life. Salvage workers are dismantling the Reijin's top decks and ferrying the scrap metal and some cars ashore. The rest of the ship will be refloated, towed out and sunk in at least 6,000 feet of water, <PERSON> Horta </PERSON> said in an interview. Cars now being unloaded will be dumped 40 miles off the coast, and the wreck, with the remaining cargo, will be scuttled 150 miles out by mid-November, the admiral said. The <ORGANIZATION> Robin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an ecology group based in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, has called the decision `` an ecological crime'' and further criticism has come from the <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> Convention, which monitors sea pollution. Portuguese environmentalists want action from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, of which <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> has been a member since Jan. 1, 1986. `` It is indeed a crime, dangerous to the whole world, not just to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a German lecturer at <LOCATION> Oporto </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biomedical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview. `` Any ecology schoolbook will tell you that one liter of oil pollutes one million liters of water.'' Marine authorities feel they have no choice. If the government tried to salvage the wreck, it not only would have to pay the estimated cost of $ 15 million but might also face claims from Japanese automakers contending that their images were tarnished by the sale of potentially unsafe cars to bargain-hunters. `` We could not take over the task of removing the ship ourselves because we did not have the technical, financial or even legal means to do so before the autumn bad weather,'' <PERSON> Horta </PERSON> said. Coast guard officials say the first storm of the winter season probably would destroy the grounded vessel and spread the wreckage in Portuguese coastal waters. So, the admiral said, `` we consider the plan to dump at sea the lesser evil.'' Removal of another ship _ the <LOCATION> Tollan </LOCATION>, grounded in the Tagus estuary off <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> in 1980 _ cost the government more than $ 1.4 million and officials want to avoid a far larger bill for the Reijin. Owners are required by <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> law to remove wrecks declared to be dangerous, but <PERSON> Horta </PERSON> said: `` It is, unfortunately, well-known that this obligation very often can not be enforced.'' Shipping companies that operate under the Panamanian flag of convenience often have little capital other than their vessels. <PERSON> Horta </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reijin </PERSON> apparently was the only valuable asset of <ORGANIZATION> Emerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipholding </ORGANIZATION>. Insurers are reluctant to talk about the case, but one based in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, speaking privately, said he was `` mystified that such a modern, well-equipped ship could sink in shallow waters after making a long, tough voyage from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' One theory is that the computerized self-leveling system overreacted when about 200 cars were unloaded in <LOCATION> Oporto </LOCATION> and the crew was unable to adjust it.

 New outbreaks of racial insults were reported at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> as the second anniversary neared of a post-World Series brawl at the state school that injured 10 people. At <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> sent a memo to the school's 2,722 undergraduates last week saying that notes with racial slurs had been slipped under a student's door and tacked onto a bulletin board. A separate memo from the Office of Student Affairs said other students had received four similar notes since mid-September. The school said an investigation was under way. A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> administrator said he was looking into reports of racial slurs made over walkie-talkies two weeks ago, on a frequency reserved for foremen and supervisors of the <ORGANIZATION> Physical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> campus of 26,650 students. `` I've been working as dispatcher here 13 years and I've never heard anything like that,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hmieleski </PERSON>, the radio dispatcher on duty at the time. `` You hear people joking around sometimes and you take it for that, but it was the tone of the voice. You could tell it was no joke.'' <PERSON> Hmieleski </PERSON> said he was n't certain who made the remarks. He said he and other workers reported them to their department's director, who said he expects to make his findings public later this week. There have been recent racial incidents at other schools in the nation. Six <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fraternities and sororities apologized for a `` ghetto party'' with decorations that included graffiti slurs against black and other minorities. Members of the six organizations at the <LOCATION> Greencastle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, campus staged a candlelight vigil Monday night and marched from the <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Omega </LOCATION> house, where the party was held Friday night, to the Association for Afro-American Students office. Members of the two groups conferred, shook hands and embraced. At <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, officials promised to look into two racist incidents in recent weeks. Last Friday, a poster at the predominantly black fraternity house <PERSON> Ujamaa </PERSON> was discovered emblazoned with the word `` niggers.'' Two weeks earlier a flier depicting <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> as brown-skinned, with wild, curly hair, big lips and red eyes was left outside the room of a black freshman from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The reports of incidents at the western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> schools came as the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> prepared for a weeklong commemoration of a fight between white <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> fans and black <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> fans after the <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> won the final game of the World Series on Oct. 27, 1986. Soon after the fight, racial epithets were found spray-painted on steps at <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. A year later, two black administrators and the first black woman to earn tenure at <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> resigned from their posts, saying the school had shut minorities out of decision making. Another fight between blacks and whites at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> last February sparked a six-day building takeover by more than 100 minority students protesting racial violence and what they said was a low minority enrollment. At least 8 percent of undergraduates at the school last year were minorities. The six students accused of fighting last winter are scheduled to appear in <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION> for a hearing Oct. 27. To mark the anniversary, the university plans a week of racism-awareness events beginning Friday. They include `` Hands Across UMass,'' a chain of students linking hands around the campus, and a lecture by civil rights activist and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> unveiled its plan to combat racism in a report released last week that, among other things, calls for a 20 percent minority faculty by mid-1999 and gives the college until 1995 to admit a first-year class with the same percentage of minority students as the population of high school graduates. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said 19 percent of this year's freshman class and 13.5 percent of the total student population are minorities A committee of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> faculty, trustees, administrators and students came up with the plan after 200 students marched on the president's house in April with a list of grievances, including demands to be included in the hiring of an affirmative action officer. `` It's a good plan, especially when one considers it's coming in to fill a complete vacuum,'' said <PERSON> Wambui </PERSON> <PERSON> Mwangi </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

<BYLINE>WASHINGTON TODAY: ``Sorry, Senator. Your Amendment Was Sent to
Purgatory.''

<TEXT>
 Is the amendment in purgatory? Only the category will tell. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, struggling to deal with hundreds of amendments to a bill providing new ammunition for the war on drugs, hammered together a system designed to speed its work and permit <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to adjourn for the year. At times it appeared that the labor-and-time-saving device might prove a tottering house of cards that would bring all progress to a halt. It worked this way: The amendments were assigned to categories. With some, the skids were greased. With others, the road ahead was rocky indeed. Still others faced a fate uncertain. Category 1 amendments were offered as a package containing scores of legislative initiatives and eventually all were approved on a single bloc vote. Category 2 amendments might stand a chance, but only if they were approved by a panel of senators from both parties. Decisions could be appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic leaders. `` Those are the purgatory amendments,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` They do not know where they are going. And they may not be going anywhere.'' Category 3 amendments could be offered individually and face their chances. Category 4 amendments did not make the cut and had no chance at all. It took unanimous consent of all 100 senators for the gears to mesh and the system to move forward. The spur to getting that consent was the desire of many senators facing re-election contests to leave the capital and get on with campaigning. Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, had a complaint. `` I had an amendment and I find it is not even on the purgatory list,'' he said. `` That raises the question to me whether my amendment went to heaven or hell,'' he said. `` How do I find that out?'' `` It went to hell,'' replied Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>: `` I know the senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> might want me to go there, but where did my amendment go? <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>: `` It is on list No. 4. `` What happens to list No. 4? <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> asked. `` Nothing,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> replied.

 Bean soup, that enduring congressional culinary tradition, has been on the menu of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Restaurant for most of the days of this century, every day for the last 85 years at least. But being on the menu does not necessarily mean being on the stove or on the table. And one day 45 years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> recalled, the bean soup pots stopped bubbling for the first time ever. `` Even though bean soup was on the menu that day at 10 cents a cup, 15 cents a bowl, it was n't cooking on the stove,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. The day was Sept. 14, 1943, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was beanless and therefore soupless. `` This was because war-time rationing had slashed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s supply of white <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> beans,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> explained `` Somehow, by the next day, more beans were found and bowls of bean soup have been ladled up without any interruption ever since,'' he said. Bean soup is on the menu in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> because it was ordered to be there. There is some question as to who gave the orders. Some attribute the decree to Sen. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Bean soup was his favorite and he presided over the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which in turn presided over the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> restaurant. Therefore, bean soup went on the menu. Others say the demand was made in 1903 by Sen. <PERSON> Knute </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The rage for bean soup soon spread to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and in 1904 Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, was outraged that the menu of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> restaurant did not list it. For years Cannon's words on the subject were also printed on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> menu, along with a recipe for the now famous soup: `` Thunderation, I had my mouth set for bean soup. From now on, hot or cold, rain, snow or shine, I want it on the menu every day.'' There are many differences in the operating styles of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said that the preparation of bean soup is one of them. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> recipe calls for adding onions braised in butter. The House recipe calls for beans, beans, beans _ nothing but beans.

<HEAD>IRS Failing To Collect Billions In Business Taxes, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> could collect billions of dollars more a year by using the same aggressive enforcement tactics against businesses that it uses against individual taxpayers, a congressional report says. The report by the Government Operations subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs comes amid a presidential campaign in which <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has made more aggressive collection of unpaid taxes a cornerstone of his economic proposals. The subcommittee report, released Monday, says the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> should develop a program to match `` information returns'' showing interest and dividend income paid to businesses with the actual tax returns filed by each company. The report estimated that between $ 3.2 billion and $ 8 billion a year in taxes on interest and dividends earned by businesses is never collected because the income is not reported to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> for years has been using its computers to compare information returns listing interest and dividend payments to individuals with the income tax returns filed by the individuals. The program produced $ 2.35 billion in additional tax revenue from individuals in fiscal 1985. Banks and corporations are not required to file such information returns, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> still received 26 million such returns in 1985, showing income payments to 5 million businesses totaling $ 987 billion. Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the subcommittee, has introduced legislation to mandate the filing of information returns by businesses He said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has n't even been using the corporate returns it has been receiving without such a requirement. `` By casting these information returns aside, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is not only missing the chance to assess many billions of dollars of unreported business tax liabilities but has created a double standard of enforcement that is more lenient by far toward businesses than individuals,'' <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said Monday the agency has not seen the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report and will not comment until agency officials review it. But at a hearing before Barnard's subcommittee last year, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said the additional tax revenue that would be generated by a document matching program for corporations would not justify the administrative costs. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said those costs would be much higher than for the document matching program for individuals because corporations use different fiscal years, varying accounting methods and different names. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report said the problems cited by <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> all `` pertain to the way income is reported'' to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> never considered the desirability of modifying the reporting requirements, nor assessed the feasibility of a partial document matching program encompassing those corporations to which the difficulties do not pertain,'' the report said. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> promised the subcommittee last year that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> would begin using document matching to verify income reported on tax returns from single-owner businesses and would start a multiyear study to determine the extent of business under-reporting of interest and dividend income. He also said the agency would begin a test program using information returns to detect corporations and partnerships that do not file any income tax returns. That test program in one district office was so successful, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report said, that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> now has expanded it to nine more districts and could have a document matching program ready by next spring to identify nonfilers among corporations and partnerships nationwide. Despite such efforts, <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> still `` has not been sufficiently diligent in attempting to extend its sophisticated computer matching capabilities to businesses.'' `` Individuals, and now sole proprietors, who know that each and every one of their returns will be scrutinized by <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> computers for unreported income deserve to know why corporate and partnership returns are being excused from this automatic examination process,'' he said.

 The government is investigating complaints that about 100,000 pickup trucks made by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> may have a tendency to go out of control because of a defective bolt that harms the vehicles' braking system. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it had opened an investigation into unconfirmed reports of brake problems involving 1988 Chevrolet and GMC half-ton pickup trucks. It also undertook six other probes involving major automakers. One person reportedly died when a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> pickup truck's rear-brake backing bolt broke off and fell into the brake assembly, the agency said. The agency said it had received two other unconfirmed reports of the brake problem. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudgens </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> headquarters, said the company would cooperate fully with the investigation. `` Just because there is an inquiry does n't mean there is a defect,'' he said. `` That would remain to be seen.'' The six other investigations started by the agency in September were in response to complaints of: _ Anti-lock braking failure in 43,000 1985-1987 <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Continentals </PERSON> The agency said it had received nine unconfirmed complaints, including one that involved an accident. _ Compartment fires in 1980-1988 Ford Crown Victorias equipped with the 5.8-liter V-8 engine The vehicles are used mainly by police departments. The agency reported eight complaints. _ Fires and loss of power steering caused by a power-steering hose in 90,000 1986-model Buick LeSabres The agency received two complaints, one of which involved a fire. _ Burned carpeting from overheated exhaust systems in 64,000 1987-1988 Chrysler Dodge Daytonas The agency received four complaints. _ Sudden separation of the steering wheel in 40,000 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> vehicles The agency received two complaints. _ Fuel expulsion in the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s P-30 chassis, used by other manufacturers as a base for motor homes Engineers at the traffic safety agency found no defect trend in preliminary evaluations of four defect complaints involving major manufacturers and closed the investigations. The complaints involved: _ Throttle control problems in the 1987-1988 Chrysler Jeep _ Halfshaft failure in the 1984-1986 Ford Tempo and <PERSON> Topaz </PERSON> _ Defogger fires in the 1987 Toyota Corolla _ Frame cracking in the 1982-1985 GM Camaro and Firebird No defect trends were found in two engineering analyses, the next highest level of investigation, involving major manufacturers. The investigations were into complaints of rear-brake lockup on the 1981-1982 Chevette diesel car and the 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerostar </ORGANIZATION>. The agency closed an engineering analysis into allegations of defective power steering in <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s 1980-1986 A-body, J-body and X-body cars, concluding that any defect posed no unreasonable risk to motorists.

<HEAD>Routine Painting Leads to Discovery of Airline Cracks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A routine repainting job led to the discovery of a foot-long crack in an aging <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, five months after the government had ordered special inspections to look for such flaws. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that the large crack as well as 29 smaller ones were discovered near a window of the first-class section after paint was stripped from the plane in preparation for repainting Oct. 5. The cracks stretched about 30 inches along a joint where sections of metal skin overlap, according to investigators of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, whose metallurgists are examining the section. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> called it a `` chilling discovery'' in a speech Monday to an aviation group in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and said it was `` frightening'' because the cracking was found `` in the same general area'' where an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane broke apart last April while in flight. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> has yet to issue a finding of the reason for the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> breakup, although it has been widely speculated that corrosion and a type of `` cold bonding'' used in older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s played a part. A 20-foot section of the Aloha jet tore away during flight, sweeping a flight attendant to her death. The plane miraculously landed safely despite the gaping hole. The Aloha and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> planes both were built in 1969 using the cold bonding method. While the Aloha plane had 89,000 takeoffs and landings at the time of the incident, the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> aircraft had only 55,446 such cycles, officials said. The Aloha plane was No. 152 off the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> assembly line, while the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> jet was No. 17O. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials cautioned against drawing too close a parallel between the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> incident and the cracks found on the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> jet. One <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition he not be further identified, said the cracks on the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> jet were located lower on the aircraft, near a window, where repair work apparently had been performed by a previous owner of the plane. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> last May issued an order that all older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s _ those with at least 30,000 cycles _ undergo a special visual inspection for cracking. Planes with at least 55,000 cycles had to undergo `` eddy current'' tests using high-frequency electronic equipment along the top of the aircraft. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, said the aircraft in question had been visually inspected, as required by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, last May and no cracks were found. He said the section where the foot-long crack was discovered Oct. 5 was not subject to the more sophisticated electronic `` eddy current'' test under the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive. An <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckhorn </PERSON>, said the agency expects to issue a new directive soon to airlines broadening the inspection requirements, including increased use of eddy current testing. The new rule also will require that the planes be stripped of paint when inspected, he said. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said after the cracking was discovered Oct. 5, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> inspected all 42 of its older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s within 72 hours and found no cracking problems with any of the planes. `` This appears to be an isolated incident,'' he said from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 is widely used for short-haul flights. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 212 older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s operated by 19 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines in domestic service were subject to the special <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspection requirements last May. A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the manufacturer was aware of the cracks discovered by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, but referred all questions to the airline.

<HEAD>Dairy Farmers To Benefit From New Government Computer System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers soon will be getting information from a new computer system devised by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to help them select only the best cows for their milking herds _ the cream of the crop, so to speak. The genetic evaluation system, called the Animal Model, takes into account more of a cow's relatives than does the older system, the Modified Contemporary Comparison, which has been used since 1974, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Under the new system, milk production of a cow's daughters will be considered when the mother is being evaluated. And the evaluation of bulls, based in part on the records of the male's offspring, also take into account the impact of the bull's mate on those offspring The new system will be used for the first time in dairy genetic evaluations to be prepared in July 1989, the report said. The information then will be reported to dairy farmers who can use it to decide which cows and their calves to keep in the herd. `` With this information in hand, the farmer can select with more accuracy the calves likely to be the most efficient milk producers,'' the report said. The new system, a revision of the older method, was developed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggans </PERSON>, a research geneticist at the agency's facility in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, Md. The older method was developed by <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>. Agency work in genetic evaluation for many years has been an important part of a nationwide effort to improve the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dairy herd. Milk output rose from 7,029 pounds per cow in 1960 to 13,293 pounds in 1986, the report said. The trend has continued, with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> figures showing the average milk production last year rose further to an average of 13,932 pounds. `` Approximately 60,000 farmers participate in the improvement program, which involves recording milk production of each cow for one day every month,'' the report said. `` Information on each animal is compiled and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improvement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, home to approximately 39 million milk production records on 15 million cows.'' The participating dairy farmers then receive reports on each of their animals, the report said. <PERSON> Wiggans </PERSON> began working on the new system two years ago and in May 1987 transferred the programs to computers at the <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supercomputer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, N.Y. The <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> supercomputer has a very large memory, which was necessary to handle all the additional details of the evaluations, including all the relatives of milk cows, he said.

 The financial worth of burley tobacco producers is far below the national average for other farmers, but they also have fewer debts, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study says. The study by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> involved 273 burley tobacco farms surveyed by questionnaire in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> for the 1984 crop, the most recent information available. It said the net worth of burley tobacco producers averaged $ 130,715, substantially below the $ 322,732 average for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm producers. The average farm debt for burley farms was about a third less than the average for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm producers. According to the report, which was distributed here on Monday, the farms produced an average of 2.3 acres of burley, a cigarette tobacco. The crop is labor intensive and required an average of 240 hours of family and hired labor per acre, or 13 hours per 100 pounds of leaf produced in 1984. An additional 11 hours of custom labor was used on each acre. The 2.3 acres of burley tobacco was grown on farms averaging a total of 122 acres of farmland. `` Most farms relied on non-farm sources to supplement their income,'' the report said. `` Small tobacco farms with less than 2.1 acres of burley generally averaged equal sales from crops and livestock. Large tobacco farms with 6 or more acres of burley tobacco depended less on livestock sales, receiving more than 70 percent of their gross cash farm income from crop sales.''

 A new labeling law in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> may restrict that country's imports of soybean oil in favor of other kinds of vegetable oil, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> trade report. The law requires that some labels for edible vegetable oil containers indicated `` oil for dressing and frying,'' while other labels indicate `` oil for dressing'' only, says the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Basis for the labeling is whether the vegetable oil contains 2 percent or less of linolenic acid, which would qualify as `` oil for dressing and frying.'' If the acid content is more than that, it would be restricted to dressings. Sunflowerseed oil, which is produced widely in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, has the lower acid content and would qualify as a dual-purpose oil. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. However, soybean oil, mostly from outside the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> _ including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ has 7 percent linolenic acid and would be restricted to dressings, the report said.

 Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Egyptian and Pakistani government agencies undercuts the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy of helping private business and discouraging government-owned enterprise, congressional investigators have concluded. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors government spending for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, cited as an example the fact that the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> had encouraged <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to end agricultural subsidies but also had financed $ 142 million in fertilizer and $ 123 million in wheat and cotton imports that the Pakistani government sells to farmers and consumers at subsidized prices. The largest of these `` commodity import programs'' benefit <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has had $ 3 billion worth of this kind of aid since 1975, the report said. Official AID policy holds that goods received by government-owned enterprises at subsidized prices hurt a country's development because they discourage sales at market prices The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also reported that the Egyptian government had piled up $ 325 million worth of Egyptian pounds _ representing more than half the proceeds from sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid goods _ instead of using the money for development projects. `` ... The cost of this large accumulation of local currencies remaining idle is high in terms of missed opportunities to support development,'' the report said. The report included a memo from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON>, the assistant AID administrator, saying that the Egyptian government has tentatively promised to release about $ 165 million worth of the local currency for development efforts this year and next. The congressional investigators said that when asked about the situation, AID officials in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> `` acknowledged the detrimental effects of subsidies, but said the political dimension of these programs limited their leverage in moving these programs to achieve greater impact.''

 Police arrested 214 of about 1,000 demonstrators who tried unsuccessfully to blockade the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> during a protest of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Authorities said most of the arrests Monday were on charges of obstructing passage. There were scattered episodes of fisticuffs between police and demonstrators, and three people were charged with assault, but the protesters failed to achieve their goal of stopping <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> workers from entering the building. The demonstration was sponsored by a coalition of a half-dozen peace groups. The protesters succeeded in forcing <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> workers to abandon the huge parking lot south of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> _ which normally accommodates 3,700 cars _ and to run a human gauntlet through selected entrances to get to their offices. `` But they did n't shut down the building; they just created a lot of inconvenience and long walks,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Flood </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Police, including one officer who was attacked by protesters, arrested several people when they sat in a road to block a military bus from entering the parking lot. One demonstrator sprayed red paint across the front of a bus. Protesters then pushed one <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officer to the ground when he tried to arrest the demonstrator and beat the officer before other officers rescued him. The demonstrators oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Salvadoran government, which has been engaged in a war against leftist guerrillas since 1980. An estimated 60,000 people have died in that conflict, which has produced continuing allegations of `` death squad'' killings by policemen and soldiers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> one of its closest allies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The protesters maintain the leftist guerrillas are willing to negotiate an end to the fighting but that the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> government _ backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ refuses to compromise in any way. On Monday, they offered loud chants of opposition to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies, yelling: `` No violence, no war, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' and `` Hey hey, ho ho, the Pentagon has got to go.''

 A dozen black operators of <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> restaurants have charged in a lawsuit that the fast-food company gave black franchise holders uprofitable locations and reserved more lucrative outlets for white operators. The discrimination and anti-trust lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday, charged that <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> also gave white operators more favorable financing terms. Blacks were charged as much as twice what white operators paid to purchase or lease stores and equipment, the lawsuit said. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, a Burger King spokeswoman, said Monday, `` We ca n't really respond until we have had an opportunity to see the suit and evaluate what the allegations are. The Miami-based company also was accused of discouraging black franchise holders from expanding to other locations by thwarting their attempts to obtain loans. The black operators also charged that the company did not give them the opportunity to obtain franchises for lucrative downtown locations, which subsequently were awarded to whites. Blacks who were awarded franchises in middle - and upper-income neighborhoods were leased stores that had `` deficient equipment, poor dining facilities, poor parking and drive-thru locations and inferior sales potential,'' the suit said The lawsuit, which seeks $ 500 million in punitive and compensatory damages, also accused company officials of trying to `` harass, threaten, coerce, intimidate and otherwise malign'' franchise holders after learning of their plans to file the suit. The lawsuit also charged that Burger King intentionally misrepresented the sales potential of locations sold to black operators. In addition to the 12 named plaintiffs, the lawsuit was brought on behalf of some 100 current and former black franchise holders by the <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Education Fund, a non-profit, public-interest law firm.

The 72-year-old is cast as a Progressive in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, an independent in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and a consumer candidate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. He entered the 1988 race, he says, because `` there is no real choice between Democrats and Republicans.'' This time around, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> proclaims, `` I do n't expect to lose.'' <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON>, the first black female presidential candidate to win a ballot slot in all 50 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, has a more modest goal in mind _ to see that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gets buried on Nov. 8. The standard-bearer of the New Alliance party, which originally supported the candidacy of Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON> says she hopes to draw enough votes away from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to make the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> take notice. Asked which candidate she prefers, <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON> says, `` That's like asking black people in slavery if they'd rather have a good master or a bad one. ... I do n't like their parties. They're plastic people.'' Another long shot presidential hopeful is <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, appearing on most ballots as a Libertarian. A former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, he quit the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 saying President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had presided over a government of massive budget deficits and too many bureaucrats. Given a choice, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> says, he would `` deregulate everything and you get rid of all the bums, all the bureaucrats who are running the bureaus.'' And there are lesser-known candidates as well, including Socialist <PERSON> Willa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenoyer </PERSON>, who will appear on seven state ballots. `` I learned my socialism on my daddy's knee back in the mid-1930s,'' said <PERSON> Kenoyer </PERSON>, a free-lance writer from <LOCATION> Shelby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. While she says her party is more interested in spreading its ideas than trying to put a socialist in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, she still has plans should she happen to make it that far. The first hour, <PERSON> Kenoyer </PERSON> says, would be spent dismantling the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. `` The second hour, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> goes.'' Political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, under indictment for fraud and conspiracy, is also listed in several states, often under the banner of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Historically, third-party candidates have a difficult time. In 1968, then-segregationist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> mounted the biggest vote-getting campaign for a third-party candidate in the nation's history _ and he attracted just 10 million votes. In 1984, Libertarian <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON> finished in third place behind <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, drawing only 227,204 votes.

<TEXT>
 The presidential campaign motorcade speeds down a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> freeway at about 75 mph but without <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents, a police escort and highway roadblocks. The motorcade consists of three cars _ the candidate in the front seat of a four-door <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> that has a radar detector perched on the dashboard and two reporters weaving their vehicles in and out of traffic, desperately trying to keep pace. This is no ordinary national political campaign. If a dark suit, light blue shirt and red striped tie make for the classic uniform of a presidential hopeful, then <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is playing the part correctly. But that's where the similarity to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democratic contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ends. The 53-year-old <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, a former four-term <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is the <ORGANIZATION> Libertarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> nominee for president. His campaign is low-key and its operating budget miniscule compared to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but he will share a ballot spot next month with his better-known rivals in 47 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` The odds are n't very good,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said of his presidential chances during a recent campaign stop in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` But the odds are very good that we are going to take hold in this country. We're realistic in knowing we're not going to be elected this year, but we're not a fly-by-night operation.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s campaign is not so much aimed at electing him but about promoting the philosophy of the Libertarians, who claim a membership of more than 200,000 nationwide. The party has fielded a presidential candidate in every election since 1972 and garnered about 250,000 votes in the 1984 contest. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, by profession an obstetrician and gynecologist, rarely refers to himself during campaign appearances, preferring instead to tout his party's goals of a completely free marketplace, unbridled civil liberties and a non-interventionist foreign policy. `` We're spoiling the comfort of the politicians who wo n't deal with the problems and are bankrupting the country,'' he said. `` That's a great role.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, a true opponent of government interference and bureaucracy, favors abolishing the personal income tax and the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, disbanding the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, pulling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops out of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and eliminating all drug laws, thus making illegal drugs legal. He would also let private firms handle Social Security, return the country to the gold standard and get the government out of public education. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who served in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from 1976 to 1984, says he quit the Republicans after becoming disenchanted with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` He told me he would get the government off my back,'' he said. `` But look what's happening. If you look at the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> or INS or whoever, they're not off our backs. They're into our wallets and into our bedrooms and into our private lives more so than ever before.'' His rather populist message draws a smattering of enthusiastic applause during campaign appearances. On the drug issue, however, some of the opposition can get hostile, especially when <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> suggests it should be left up to the individual whether to use narcotics. `` I was in favor of everything he says until he got to the drug issue,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Azmeh </PERSON>, 19, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> student, said after a recent <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> campaign appearance. `` I have a small brother and he watches TV and I know how advertising affects him.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> believes making drugs legal would reduce crime by 50 percent and eliminate the profit motive for drug dealers since the substances would be readily available. `` It's pretty hard to get a young person to work for $ 4 an hour when they can make $ 400 a day pushing drugs,'' he said. `` Those profits and high salaries would be gone if drugs were n't so artificially pumped up in price.'' He also draws disapproving murmurs when he suggests that the nation's space program should be left to private companies. `` Whether or not I ever run for another office again is irrelevant,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. `` I'm dealing in ideas that are important to me and my family. I know I will work for those ideas because they are so important and so valuable.'' After nearly 10 months full-time on the campaign trail, after appearances in nearly all of the states, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> says he has a feeling of `` tiredness but not futility.'' `` I see in the 1990s we could very well be a major party,'' he says.

 Black voters will be having less of a decisive impact in this year's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races than two years ago, even though two candidates are black, because few of the contests are being held in the South. `` There are n't as many races in which the black vote is a powerful bloc this time,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Two years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> elections were held in seven Southern states, four of which have blacks comprising more than 20 percent of their voting age population. In all seven states Democrats were elected or re-elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. That arithmetic was not lost on <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who tried to wring endorsements for his presidential campaign out of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> senators, saying they owed their jobs to black voters. This year, however, there are but three Southern races for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and in just one, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, is there a high concentration of black voters. More than 30 percent of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s voting age population is black. However, in that state neither Republican <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> nor Democrat <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowdy </PERSON>, both of whom are congressmen running to succeed retiring Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>, has tailored his campaign messages to make a special appeal to blacks, although both acknowledge the importance of such a large bloc of voters, their campaign spokesmen said. `` Our message is very simple: We are offering opportunity,'' <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, campaign manager for <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview. `` We want to bring more and better jobs to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>.'' `` If you look all over our advertising, it's pretty monotone,'' he said. <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>'s strategy to win black support is direct: `` We're asking,'' said <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> `` That sounds pretty simple, but we are.'' `` We're not giving up any vote to <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowdy </PERSON>,'' he said. `` He's spending a lot of money,'' said <PERSON> Dowdy </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON>. `` But basically what he's spending money on is disguising his abysmal record on civil rights.'' While polls show <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> leading overall in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race, they also indicate he has barely dented black support for Dowdy. An independent poll conducted in late September and early October by <ORGANIZATION> Mason-Dixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> leading Dowdy 49 percent to 41 percent with 10 percent undecided. Among black voters, though, the poll shows Dowdy with a 10-to-1 lead over <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>. The poll, which surveyed 812 likely voters, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Although there are two major-party black candidates running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this year, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, both are Republicans and are considered long shots in races against popular Democrats, former Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Both Republicans and Democrats say the two black <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates are not tokens nominated to water down traditional support for the Democrats. `` <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> ... was in no sense hand-picked,'' said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` In <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>' case, he has fought any attempt to make it look like he is a token black running.''

<TEXT>
 Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a 17-point lead in a new national poll, and nearly three quarters of the respondents said they expected him to win next month's election The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll Monday put the race at 55-38 percent, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s biggest lead over Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> since the campaign began. The margin was considerably greater than in surveys earlier this month. Told of the result, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said: `` I do n't believe it.'' He said the campaign's own polls indicated a smaller, unspecified deficit, with more undecided voters. It was the first full-sized poll after Thursday's debate, in which smaller overnight polls found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the winner. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 10 points in those polls, but they were conducted only among debate viewers, a more Republican group. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led by five or six points in most pre-debate polls. Said Brountas: `` If there has been an increase in the gap it may be attributable to some of the stories about the debate.'' The NBC-Journal poll was conducted Friday through Sunday among 1,378 likely voters and had a three-point margin of error. Almost three-quarters of the respondents said they expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to win the election, including half of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' own supporters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was rated favorably by 36 percent, down from 50 percent a month ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was favorably rated by 55 percent, up from 50 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led chiefly among men: They backed him by 64-30 percent, while the race among women was a nearly even, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead 48-44.

 A 76-year-old woman who had been in a coma since surgeons placed her in `` suspended animation'' six week ago to remove an egg-sized aneurysm near her brain has died. <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> died Monday, hours after she was transferred to D.T. <ORGANIZATION> Watson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for therapy.

 Lions stopped roaring Monday as flames threatened a shelter for abandoned exotic animals, as well as a home for disturbed children, and a second blaze headed toward ancient trees in <LOCATION> Sequoia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> as fires burned more than 5,900 acres in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` If the wind picks up it could flare up into a 40-foot sheet of fire and a fireball could roll over us without batting an eyelid,'' said <PERSON> Martine </PERSON> <PERSON> Colette </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Wildlife Waystation, the animal shelter in Angeles National Forest's <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tujunga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> area 30 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Several blazes, including a 1,500-acre fire burning near trees up to 2,700 years old in <LOCATION> Sequoia </LOCATION>, erupted during the weekend when <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was blasted with temperatures near 100 degrees in some areas and dry desert wind gusting to 30 mph. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> said southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will experience a cooling trend in the next couple of days but, with 25 mph mountain wind, conditions would n't change much for firefighters until Tuesday night or Wednesday morning <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> said the 3,100-acre Divide brush fire was 1 -LCB- miles from Wildlife Waystation, but <PERSON> Colette </PERSON> insisted flames pushed to within three-quarters of a mile. The shelter is home to more than 1,000 creatures, including tigers, giraffes and a wide variety of other abandoned exotic pets, plus wild animals that wandered into residential neighborhoods. `` We will have to make our stand here,'' <PERSON> Colette </PERSON> said. `` It would not be feasible to evacuate the animals. ... The animals are extremely quiet. The lions stopped roaring and the coyotes stopped howling. They can smell the fire.'' The refuge was expected to remain safe as long as winds did n't whip up during the night, <ORGANIZATION> Waystation </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said late Monday The fire, which was 20 percent contained, moved toward and then past about seven homes in the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tujunga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> area north of <LOCATION> Sylmar </LOCATION> and northeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. There was no damage but most of the families evacuated, said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Waystation </ORGANIZATION> and at <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Childrens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a home for 125 emotionally disturbed children in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tujunga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, also were told they might need to evacuate if the fire got closer, the sergeant said. Officials estimated that blaze will be surrounded by fire lines by Wednesday evening and extinguished two days later, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderhaar </PERSON> said. Two firefighters suffered minor injuries. More than 600 firefighters were aided by nine air tankers and three helicopters that began dropping water and fire-retardant chemicals at dawn Monday as the blaze burned dry brush in inaccessible mountainous terrain, said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> firefighter <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>. Three men were initially suspected of starting the fire with an illegal campfire, a felony punishable by up to six years in prison. But the men were released Monday, said Deputy <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, because, `` It appears a 10-year-old boy has admitted to it.'' In Sequoia National Park, 600 firefighters battled to protect the 3-square-mile <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, a grove of trees considered the largest living things on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON>. Flames `` are right now at the edge of the forest,'' but a successful backfire broadened a buffer zone around the grove, she said. The majestic trees can survive fires because their thick bark can withstand considerable heat and flame, but `` a sequoia tree is fire-resistant, not fireproof,'' Case said. Authorities also were concerned about a restaurant, hotel, cabins and gas station about three miles from the flames, she added. Case said the fire broke out Sunday morning at a camping area on the middle fork of the <LOCATION> Kaweah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, about 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Visalia </LOCATION> and 175 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. One hundred campers left so a fire camp could be established, she added. The fire was blamed on a careless camper or fisherman because there was no lightning in the area at the time, Case said. Firefighters contained a brush fire Monday that burned more than 800 acres in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hemet </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Cheri </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Division of Forestry. A 300-acre brush fire burned out of control near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 95 about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Blythe </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> border, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said. It threatened some homes Sunday but posed no danger to dwellings Monday, she added. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said 15 small brush fires that started Sunday throughout <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were extinguished. Some were arson, others were caused by campfires and one was ignited by a motorcycle's hot exhaust pipe, she said. Two more weekend fires erupted in the mountainous eastern section of the Angeles National Forest. One destroyed a house near the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baldy </LOCATION> ski resort.

The girl, the daughter of <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was taken to a fire station Friday by four adults connected with <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>'s group. She was already dead. <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorea </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> had been beaten and whipped severely, state <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> Dr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewman </PERSON> said. Some of the other children bore marks and scars, said <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> branch manager of the state Children's Service Division `` We're led to believe that abuse had occurred,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` It's our recommendation that these children remain in protective custody, at least for a period of time.'' <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilroy </PERSON> agreed, granting custody of the youngsters to the state Children's Services Division on grounds of neglect and improper care. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>'s 25-year-old brother, <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON>, posted $ 3,000 bail after he was booked Sunday for investigation of child endangerment, said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Police Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>. An arraignment was scheduled Nov. 10, <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said Monday. In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the children, ranging in age from 1 -LCB- months to 16 years, were sleeping on pillows on the floor of the sparsely furnished four-bedroom house, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. They were placed in state juvenile centers and foster homes over the weekend. `` They were quite hungry when they arrived. It seems that they only had a tomato apiece on Friday,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, acting director of client services for the state Children's Services Division. According to authorities, the children were subjected to systematic beatings with a paddle or electrical cord used to apply up to 800 strokes in front of other children, who were required to keep count. The trauma of receiving and witnessing such punishments has caused psychological damage to the youngsters, the <ORGANIZATION> Clackamas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told the court. The department's director, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, said the children `` had been unfed for an extended period of time and were in need of immediate nutrition.. They ate voluminously when afforded the opportunity.'' Representatives of 15 of the 18 families involved, from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, met with officials later in the day, and indicated they knew their children were in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. He said no visits would be allowed immediately. Another, unrelated religious boarding home, the <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> for Children outside <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, fell afoul of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> authorities in June because of alleged abuse of troubled or neglected youths. Law enforcement officials clashed with the school's founder, the Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, a former heroin addict turned independent Baptist minister. A grand jury next week will consider felony assault charges against Fountain, but no abuse or neglect charges were filed and the school is back in business. In another court hearing Monday, an attorney for <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, one of the four people charged in the death, asked that the <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> girl's body not be released pending an independent autopsy. A murder charge against <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, was reduced to first-degree manslaughter, and the other defendants, who had been held on murder charges, were charged with manslaughter. Bail was set at $ 250,000 apiece for Chambers, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON>, 30; <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Zipporah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 37; and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>, 28, all of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Clackamas County District Judge <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> set preliminary hearings for Oct. 21 for <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> and Oct. 24 for the other three. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a deputy <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney, said the charges were reduced because of difficulty in proving intent. A grand jury will begin hearing evidence in the case this week. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> attended the hearing, but declined to speak to reporters. The onetime college athlete, also leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was interviewed by <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's detectives Sunday, but declined to address a news conference. In a statement to a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> television reporter, he said the media had slanted stories about <PERSON> Ecclesia </PERSON> and portrayed him as a `` crackpot.'' `` Our whole group has been pressured into all manner of activities we would not have had to do had we been understood a little better,'' he told KATU-TV. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, 35, was a star basketball player at <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, in the 1970s. He founded the <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in 1975. Last year, Ecclesia officials claimed to have established a camp at the farm near <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> to train children for the Olympics. But it was unclear whether the children found Friday were in a similar training program. The organization brought an estimated 70 to 100 men, women and children from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to the Sandy area in April 1987. They returned to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in June 1987 after neighbors opposed Ecclesia's applications for zoning permits to allow 55 children and 45 adults to live in tents and use portable toilets and showers. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunt </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, said Ecclesia no longer exists in name but continues in spirit and concept. She said the group sometimes uses `` physical correction'' as a form of discipline, but denied the punishment was cruel. Two other members of <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>'s group were held pending $ 100,000 bail each on charges of hindering prosecution. They were identified as Sherion <PERSON> Melinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON> Josie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Faust </PERSON>, 50, both of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> was taken into custody at the <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after five children, believed to have been transported from <LOCATION> Ecclesia </LOCATION>, were found at the south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> center Sunday afternoon. `` One of the boys had evidence that he was physically assaulted while in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` One of the boys probably was physically abused here.'' The spokesman could not release the names of the minors, only saying that the boys were 10 and 15 and three girls ranged in age from 10 to 17. The children were placed with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Departent of Children's Services. It was not immediately determined whether the girls had been abused. The younger <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> and the children were the only ones at the Watts center at the time of the arrest, <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Ex President Galtieri Defends 1982 Decision To Invade Falklands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former President Gen. <PERSON> Leopoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>, on trial for mismanaging the 1982 war with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, says he would invade the territory again and does not regret starting a war. `` ` Would I do it again? Given the same circumstances and conditions, would I proceed in the same manner? The answer is yes. I, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>, would proceed the same way as I did,'' <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> said in <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. `` What was done, was done well.'' <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> and two other members of the former ruling junta _ Adm. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> and Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Basilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lami </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozo </PERSON> _ were convicted in May 1986 by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> of military mismanagement. All were sentenced to prison. On July 26, their appeal began in civilian court, along with three officers who had been acquitted by the military's highest tribunal: Vice Adm. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardo </PERSON>, Gen. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON>, and Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Parada </PERSON>. The issue is how the war was handled, including <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>'s decision to send about 12,000 troops to the islands, located 250 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fuego </LOCATION> off the southernmost tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> questioned the military's tactics and strategy, including <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>'s decision, as head of the navy, to virtually withdraw the fleet from combat after the cruiser General Belgrano was sunk in early May by a British nuclear submarine. Argentine conscripts were ill-trained, inadequately supplied and poorly led, witnesses said. The conflict began on April 2, 1982, and lasted 74 days. About 700 Argentines were killed along with 255 British troops. In his defense, <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> said the war for the islands that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> calls the <LOCATION> Malvinas </LOCATION> was narrowly lost, so charges of mismanagement are ill-founded. `` The battle for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, militarily, was lost by a narrow margin,'' he said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> claimed the islands in 1833. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> claims it inherited the islands from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> upon achieving independence in 1810. The underpopulated, windswept islands are home to about 1,900 people, mostly sheep ranchers and fishermen. Also at stake are the rights to potentially large deposits of oil and other natural resources. For <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, nationalism is a factor. Every map calls the islands the <LOCATION> Malvinas </LOCATION>. Every school child learns they were seized from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and should be returned. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison by the military tribunal and who faces a stiffer, 20-year sentence if he loses his appeal, was not repentant when he addressed the civilian court. `` In 1982, destiny knocked at the doors of the nation,'' he said. `` And the people, with dignity, decided to fulfill a historical obligation'' and reclaim the islands. The court's decision was expected by early next week.

<HEAD>New AIDS TV Spots Avoid The `C' Word</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top federal official says Americans should look to television networks and other news outlets if they think the government should be more forthright in calling for use of condoms to combat the spread of AIDS. A new wave of television spots unveiled Monday does not mention what one reporter called `` the C word'' but leaves little to the imagination of any viewer who has heard that condoms can help prevent spread of the deadly disease. The 1987 series of television ads distributed to national networks and thousands of individual stations contained direct references to condoms in some spots that got little airplay despite $ 18 million worth of free airtime devoted to less controversial messages. Nonetheless, one of the 1988 ads features a tantalizing episode in which a young man talks to the camera as he puts a sock on his foot. `` If I told you I could save my life just by putting on my socks, you would n't take me seriously,'' says the man, sitting in a chair. `` Because life is never that simple,'' he adds. `` But watch ...'' There are a few seconds of silence as he slips a sock onto his foot. `` Okay, you're right,'' the man says. `` That would n't really save my life. But there's something just as simple that could.'' Questioned at a news conference, Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, said there was a simple answer to why the government avoided specifically mentioning condoms in the new round of television spots. `` We had a great deal of difficulty getting the television stations to use that,'' he said, referring to 1987 spots that specifically mentioned condoms. `` That one was selectively avoided by the television stations.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said designers of the 1987 ad campaign tried to be careful to produce spots that would not be offensive to audiences even though some of them did discuss condoms. But he said experience showed `` there was another level of screening'' at networks and local TV stations that resulted in the condom spots rarely being seen by a general audience. With more than a dozen cameras rolling, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> was among several officials who declined to answer directly when asked whether television executives were engaging in irresponsible behavior in public health by declining to run condom spots. Eventually, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee-Miller </PERSON>, the administration's top public relations official in the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> who had been moderating the news conference, stepped forward. `` I'll answer it,'' she said. `` No, they're not engaging in responsible behavior.'' She asked reporters to `` challenge the networks'' rather than the health department. Indeed, the print ads and posters prepared for the new campaign deals with condom use in a direct way likely to draw criticism from conservatives. `` If He Wo n't Wear A Condom, Call For Help,'' says one suggested newspaper ad. One of numerous posters features a still photo from the TV spot where the man is putting a sock on his foot. `` Putting On A Condom Is Just As Simple,'' says the headline. Another series of six posters feature photos of three different men and three different women with the same headline on each: ` What Have You Got Against A Condom?'' The smaller print says, `` The simple act of putting on a condom can save your life, if they're used properly and every time you have sex For more information about AIDS and condoms, call 1-800-342-AIDS.'' Another series features three different women all saying, `` If he does n't have a condom, you just have to take a deep breath and tell him to go get one.'' Many critics have said federal officials and <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mather </ORGANIZATION>, the private advertising company hired to produce the campaign, went too far last year in trying to get sexually active Americans to use condoms. Others said the ads were not explicit enough. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said federal health officials have always said that abstinence or a monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner are the only two absolute ways to prevent sexual spread of AIDS. `` Condoms are third best,'' he said, adding it is nonetheless important for health officials to recommend their use for those who are not abstinent or in monogamous relationships with partners they are certain are uninfected.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, who won the coveted Edgar Award for mystery writers for `` In The Heat Of The Night,'' a groundbreaking novel about a black detective, has died. He was 77. The <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> resident whose approximately 30 books have bene translated into 17 languages, died Saturday after a two-year battle with cancer, said his wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>. A new murder mystery, titled `` The Van,'' will be published this spring, she said Monday. Ball worked as a music critic for the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>, music columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegram </ORGANIZATION> and assistant curator for the <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Planetarium </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Most of his books were mysteries, but he also wrote in the juvenile, aviation and military fields. It was as a mystery writer in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, following in the steps of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dashiell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON>, that Ball gained renown. Instead of hard-boiled world weary gumshoes like <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Spade </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlowe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> created a soft-spoken policeman, who happened to be black. It was a bold move that anticipated principal roles for black characters in popular fiction and film. `` They told him ` No, do n't make him black. Why not make him Chinese or something,''' said his wife. `` But <PERSON> John </PERSON> insisted. <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tibbs </PERSON> must be black.'' Thus was born the character played by <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> in the movie `` In The Heat Of The Night,'' which won four Oscars in 1967 for picture, actor -LRB- <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> -RRB-, director -LRB- <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewison </PERSON> -RRB- and screenplay -LRB- <PERSON> Stirling </PERSON> <PERSON> Silliphant </PERSON> -RRB-. `` Believe it or not, it took a long time to get it published,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said. `` He was going to let it go for almost nothing.'' The book was in the hands of a small publisher that went out of business, so it was picked up by another publisher, his wife said. For his own part, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> received the Edgar Award conferred by the Mystery Writers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the Golden Dagger by the British Crime Writers, his wife said. The Tibbs character usually faced prejudice in addition to problems of detection, but maintained his cool and went on to crack the case in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> while on a visit, using his intellect and forensic expertise. Another Ball book, `` The First Team'' about a war with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was published in 1971, more than a decade ahead of such currently popular works as `` The Hunt for Red October'' by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Clancy </PERSON> and `` Team Yankee'' by <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON>. `` The First Team'' sold to a movie studio, but got shelved in the early days of detente with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the 1970s. `` It was long before ` Red Dawn,''' she said of the recent movie about a Soviet invasion of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Services were set for Wednesday at <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION>. In addition to his wife, he was survived by his son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, and his granddaughter, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Four States Decide Whether To Gamble On Lotteries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBBIE NEWBY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Voters in four states will decide whether to take a chance on a lottery in ballot measures opposed by religious leaders and others who say state-sanctioned gambling exploits the poor. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> have lottery questions on Nov. 8's ballot. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> proposition also would clear the way for parimutuel and casino gambling, if the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> approves. Polls in the states indicate support for the issues. Proponents, who include Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and state Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Borst </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, say voting `` yes'' would bring millions of dollars into state coffers, including much-needed money for education and rural economic development. Twenty-eight states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> operate lotteries, which have grossed $ 14.8 billion in fiscal 1988, up 19.2 percent from 1987, according to Gambling and <ORGANIZATION> Wagering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Of that sum, $ 5.6 billion went to state governments and the balance to cover prizes and the cost of administration, according to lottery officials. Opponents argue lotteries encourage betting by the people who can least afford it. `` There are only 3.5 million people in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fugitte </PERSON> of Elizabethtown, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION>. `` A million of them are under 18 and 1 million are under the poverty level. ... We ca n't be for something where the more the citizens of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> bet and lose, the better off the state is.'' <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legalized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gambling </ORGANIZATION> hopes to spend $ 350,000 on advertisements and pamphlets arguing that gambling would attract organized crime to the state. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> held a `` Get Out the Vote Sunday'' to encourage congregations to vote no. Supporters such as <PERSON> Borst </PERSON> counter that such opponents `` are our best salesmen so far as making people aware of it.'' Church leaders in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> including all Lutheran and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops said they will spend the next few weeks urging congregations to vote no. Opposition in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> gained impetus when <PERSON> Morman </PERSON> leaders, usually apolitical in state affairs, began organizing against the lottery. A recent report by the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiscal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> predicts a lottery would produce about $ 134 million in annual net revenues for <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, which has 5.5 million people. Proponents in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> estimate the lottery could mean $ 70 million a year for the state, while supporters in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> say ticket sales would gross $ 40 million to $ 100 million. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, with just 1 million residents, pressure for the lottery has come from the western and northern parts of the state, where promoters say the state is losing millions of dollars to lotteries in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. They project the state could reap at least $ 2 million annually. But the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> institute's president, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, warns that forecasting lottery revenues is about as chancy as winning one, adding that it would be risky for any state to count on specific dollar amounts. `` From a fiscal standpoint, the biggest problem with lottery revenues is their unpredictability,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. `` This means that it would be unwise to dedicate those revenues to functions that require a stable resource of funding in order to operate.'' The four states stand to lose little if they opt for the game, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikesell </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> professor who has studied lotteries. `` They're basically guaranteed against losing money because we know enough about structuring prizes and operations of lottery,'' he said, adding that none should expect lotteries to be a `` booming success'' like those in more populous, urban states such as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. The four states voting `` either have substantially rural populations or small populations. Some are smack-dab in between existing lottery states that are doing pretty well or they do n't have a good tradition of gambling history,'' <PERSON> Mikesell </PERSON> said That argument is n't likely to hold water in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, said Fugitte: `` Most of the community either is neutral on the issue of gambling or they think it's all right. You've got to remember this is a horseracing state.''

 Flaky pastry puffs filled with chocolate mousse float on a tray near the swirl of whipped cream crowning a glazed bed of strawberries and a soft jelly roll oozing with a tart burst of red. For most people, this is sweet torture. To those attending the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bakery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Expo </LOCATION> this week, this is sweetly lucrative. Bakers wandered through the expo at <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, admiring stainless steel mixing bowls as big as Jacuzzis, ovens as big as dining rooms and a $ 14,000 machine that pops out 175 dozen bagels an hour. More than 10,000 buyers were expected to attend the three-day expo, which ends today. The retail baking industry generates about $ 6 billion nationwide each year, with 20,000 independent retail bakers and another 20,000 in-store bakeries across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to statistics compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Retail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bakers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We could say this show smells of opportunity and tastes of success,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bakers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The average sweet tooth might be surprised at the innovations for modern bakers displayed at the annual show. There are still frosting bags and traditional wedding cake toppers decorated with lace, but there are also gadgets such as high-tech spray guns that use food coloring to create detailed cake-top scenes. `` Business has been so good that we sold our bakery two years ago and now we sell our <ORGANIZATION> Stencil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aire </ORGANIZATION> products around the country,'' said <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, a co-partner in the young cake stenciling firm based in <LOCATION> Ripon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. At the expo, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, of the Hazelwood -LRB- Mo. Farms Bakeries, promoted a line of predecorated frozen cakes and cupcakes that stores can thaw and sell. `` It's hard to find skilled labor to decorate cakes nowadays,'' he said. `` You do n't find that many people want to be bakers anymore because of the crazy hours.'' Bakers traditionally get a predawn start on their day behind the stove. But bakers who still make their own cakes are turning to products that save time. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Alco </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Instantwhip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, pointed to a giant strawberry shortcake frosted with <PERSON> Instantwhip </PERSON> whipped cream that comes from a carton and does n't use heavy cream. `` Real heavy cream is primarily used in gourmet operations as long as people are willing to pay the high price,'' he said. But <PERSON> D'Alco </PERSON> did n't have to continue touting his product. A husband-wife baking team stopped at his booth to rave. `` Real whipped cream turns into water if you beat it too much,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, co-owner of the Bel Air -LRB- Md. -RRB- Bakery. `` Fresh whipped cream is the worst thing you could use,'' said her husband, <PERSON> James </PERSON>. Even the decorations on cakes can be premade. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Guttman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Bakery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crafts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION>, pointed to his variety of colorful plastic and hard sugar cake decorations. `` A lot of these decorations are labor-savers,'' he said. `` Someone who is a home cake decorator or hobbyist might be willing to spend two to three hours to decorate a cake, but a baker ca n't afford that time, unless it's a wedding cake that can cost up to $ 1,000. Of course, some people displaying their wares still practiced the old art of turning frosting into fantasy. August Riesterer, owner of the Riesterer Bakery in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, is a German native who said he has been baking for 57 years. <PERSON> Riesterer </PERSON> sat proudly behind a display of mind-boggling cakes _ including some wedding cakes that seemed to defy gravity. One featured three tiers atop pedestals, with bridges connecting six smaller layers on either side. The bride and groom stood on top, while nine bridesmaids and nine ushers climbed the tiny stairs. The cakes cost about $ 500 each, he said.

<TEXT>
 Labor and business leaders hailed President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s extension of an inflation-fighting program for one month after he takes office. Citing progress under the 10-month-old plan and other economic reforms, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> announced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday they were preparing as much as $ 3.5 billion in short-term `` bridge'' loans for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Under the Economic Solidarity Pact, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s business, farm and labor sectors and the government pledged last December to cooperate in holding down wages and prices. The latest extension to Dec. 31, published in newspapers on Monday, said recent measures taken by the government were helping hold down inflation. It mentioned a new cut in government spending, continued efforts to close or sell unprofitable and non-strategic state companies, and maintenance of monetary and credit policies that support price stability. `` We will not continue from crisis to crisis, but are going to achieve growth without inflation,'' said <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, in remarks quoted by the Excelsior news service. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivares </PERSON> <PERSON> Ventura </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campesinos </ORGANIZATION>, said the pact was not `` a straitjacket'' on workers' salaries but rather ensured that wages could be upwardly adjusted under the plan's freeze on official prices. Under the reform pact, labor has foregone wage increases since March, arguing that a small rise would give business a pretext for price hikes _ thus causing workers to lose ground. Prices of basic goods are controlled, but subsidies on many products have been gradually lifted to reduce the budget deficit. The monthly increase in consumer prices has been slashed from 15.5 percent in January to 0.6 percent in September under the plan. The rate for the first nine months of the year was 45.5 percent. When the accord was signed last December, inflation was rising to a rate of 159.2 percent for the year. `` The recent trend in prices has been satisfactory since it allowed the monthly rate of increase in September to reach the lowest level in 12 years,'' the statement said.

 A private group says the gap between the earnings of black and white families has widened in the 1980s. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says increasing poverty and economic stagnation among blacks has helped widen the gap for both married and single-parent black families. `` In 1987, the income of the typical black family _ at $ 18,098 _ equaled just 56.1 percent of the typical white family's income -LRB- $ 32,274 -RRB-, a lower percentage than any year in the late 1970s or late 1960s -LRB- 59.2 percent -RRB-,'' center Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said Monday in a statement. Median family income for black families decreased by $ 854 between 1978 and 1987, while the median income for white families increased $ 276, the study said.

<TEXT>
 Former `` Moonies'' can sue the <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> for alleged deception and brainwashing because freedom of religion does not protect fraudulent recruiting, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said in reinstating two suits. A lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> called Monday's 6-1 ruling `` a real blow'' to freedom of religion `` The challenge here ... is not to the church's teachings or to the validity of a religious conversion,'' said Justice <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosk </PERSON> in the decision. `` The challenge is to the church's practice of misrepresenting or concealing its identity in order to bring unsuspecting outsiders into its highly structured environment. That practice is not itself belief _ it is conduct subject to regulation for the protection of society.'' Reversing two lower court rulings, the high court decided that two former church members who brought their cases could seek to convince a jury that they had been brainwashed and were unable to exercise independent judgment when they joined the Rev. <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Myung </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s church after being told of its identity. In dissent, <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presiding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for the case, said religious conversion _ whether or not it involves `` brainwashing'' _ is constitutionally protected from court scrutiny. `` ` Brainwashing' and religious conversion are not really distinguishable,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, noting there were no claims of force or threatened violence in the case. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a lawyer for the church, said he would recommend an appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Lawyers for the plaintiffs, whose lawsuits had been rejected in <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and a state appellate court, hailed the ruling. The court recognized `` the rights of people who have been exploited by the dishonest and unethical practice of religion,'' said <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, lawyer for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Molko </PERSON>. `` Until this case was decided, cults had taken the position that they could do whatever they chose to do with respect to deception and fraud in their recruitment activities and claim that they were immune from responsibility by virtue of the First Amendment,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON>, attorney for his daughter, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, a lawyer for the American Baptist Churches in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> who filed written arguments supporting the <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, called the ruling `` a real blow to both free exercise of religion and the separation of church and state.'' She said it was the first ruling of its kind by any state's high court. Ms. <PERSON> Leal </PERSON>, now 28 and studying for a teaching credential at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was a 19-year-old college student when a recruiter approached her at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> bus station in 1979. A few months earlier, <PERSON> Molko </PERSON>, a 27-year-old <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lawyer newly arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, also was recruited at a bus stop. Both said the recruiters denied any church affiliation, instead claimed membership in the Creative Community Project, and invited them to dinner. Soon afterward, they said, they were taken to a retreat and subjected to intensive lectures, discussions and exercise. <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> said he was not told of the Moon affiliation for 12 days, and Ms. <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> for 22 days. Both remained church members for several months before they were abducted by `` deprogrammers'' hired by their parents, the court said. Their lawsuits sought damages from the church for emotional distress and punitive damages. <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> also sought return of his $ 6,000 he donated to the church.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> faces a hard road in selling the newly concluded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases agreement to the public and may be forced to harden her position on the thornier issue of the installations' status after 1991. First reaction to the agreement, signed Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, was at best mixed. Major newspapers accused the government of selling out by agreeing to allow the six bases to remain through 1991 in return for `` only'' $ 962 million in American aid. That was more than 2 -LCB- times the $ 180 million a year which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pledged in 1983 over a five-year period to now-ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. But the fact that the <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> won far more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance was all but lost on the public and press due to the government's having raised expectations which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats all along said were unrealistic Even before the talks began April 5, <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers quoted unidentified government sources as saying the Aquino administration would insist on $ 1.2 billion a year. Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> never explicitly confirmed the $ 1.2 billion demand but termed it `` reasonable.'' <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> aides privately told Filipino reporters that the government would hold fast to its demands. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> himself said repeatedly that compensation was not the only issue. But other issues he cited, such as confirmation of nuclear weapons at the bases and expanded criminal jurisdiction over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, were not addressed in the new agreement. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> told reporters he was optimistic that once the Filipino public understood the agreement, `` they will accept it.'' Indeed, one longtime bases opponent, Sen. <PERSON> Aquilino </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON>, said the results of the negotiations `` are certainly much better than before.'' But the absence of a detailed explanation by the government of the benefits of the agreement opened the door to criticism from the press and some lawmakers, who hope to make the bases an issue in the runup to the 1992 national elections. Under the new Constitution, any extension after 1991 must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to the bases is strong. Several senators are widely assumed to harbor presidential ambitions and are casting for an issue in the 1992 election, in which Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> says she will not be a candidate. The fact that the latest agreement was hammered out in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and not <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, raised charges that the government had indulged in the same kind of secret diplomacy for which the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> administration had been roundly criticized. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> has been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for nearly a month. When asked whether Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> herself was fully aware of all aspects of the final negotiations, her spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> replied `` I do n't think so.'' Instead, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> left details of the negotiations to <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, who has not entirely shaken off his longtime image as an `` Am-Boy,'' or `` American Boy,'' a derogatory term for Filipinos who support <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests. That strategy appeared designed in part to allow Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to escape personal political damage if the public found the agreement unsatisfactory. The results of the just concluded talks were expected to influence the government's decision on whether to negotiate a new pact extending the bases beyond 1991. Such negotiations _ assuming they are held _ will be difficult. Recent surveys show a majority of Filipinos favor retention of the bases but under favorable terms, including fixed rent. But Communist rebels and a significant portion of the urban middle class, including journalists and intellectuals, are strongly opposed to the bases, regardless of the financial impact if they were closed. `` We seem to have hung out a price tag on our sovereignty and national dignity,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Letty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez-Magsanoc </PERSON> in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. `` We are now selling out even when the price is n't right.'' In such a climate, issues which are viewed here as basic to national sovereignty are likely to be raised. These include formal notification of the presence of nuclear weapons as well as military operations launched from <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> soil. Filipino military officers are routinely barred from some sensitive areas such as code rooms, even though the six bases are nominally under Philippine command.

 Heroin smuggling charges have been dismissed against a key Mafia informant who testified against his associates at the `` maxi-trial'' in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> and the `` pizza connection'' drug case here. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officially dropped the six-count indictment Monday, saying <PERSON> Tommaso </PERSON> <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> had `` fulfilled the terms'' of his cooperation agreement with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Italian governments. `` <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> has provided, and continues to provide, exhaustive information concerning the activities of the Mafia here and in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> in court papers. `` Moreover, largely as a result of <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON>'s testimony at trials in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, hundreds of defendants have been convicted of heroin trafficking and associated organized crime activity.'' The drug indictment against <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> was filed in 1973 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. The order to dismiss the indictment, which contained the only outstanding charges against <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON>, was signed by Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. Its dismissal was included in a cooperation agreement <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> entered with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Italian governments in 1985. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> had been a soldier `` of great respect'' in the Sicilian Mafia, where his duties included settling disputes and acting as an emissary between families. His testimony at the `` pizza connection'' trial helped convict 18 defendants of participating in a Mafia-backed drug racket, operated in part through pizza parlors, that imported an estimated $ 1.6 billion worth of heroin into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He was the prosecution's first witness at the 17-month trial that ended in March 1986, and he identified certain defendants as members of the Sicilian Mafia. <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> also was among a dozen admitted Mafia members who testified at the Italian trial, described as the largest Mafia trial ever conducted. More than 300 defendants were convicted in that case last year. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> would remain in a witness protection program administered by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. He has been given a new identity and is living in this country.

 <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> has suffered another blow to its sense of separate identity: The English have overrun its cultural establishment. Ever since 1707, when <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> were united under one crown and parliament, Scots have worried about being swamped by their English neighbors, who outnumber them 11-1. Comes now `` The Englishing of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>,'' broadcast Aug. 29 on the independent Scottish television channel, which shows the command posts of Scottish culture firmly in the hands of Sassenachs from south of the border. Not the artists, mind. Native Scottish creativity has never looked healthier. What worries guardians of Scottish identity is the preponderance of Englishmen in a cultural bureaucracy supposed to be separate. `` The Englishing of Scottish life is a process that has gone on for many years, but many Scots ... feel it is beginning to undermine the very notion of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON>, the writer and host, said in introducing the program. <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> presented impressive of evidence of `` non-Scot'' infiltration, the non-Scots being almost invariably from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.

They run five of the eight universities, 10 of the 15 government-funded colleges and three of the six leading theaters. `` We are assimilating ourselves toward an English ideal and gradually I think we will assimilate ourselves out of existence,'' <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, a playwright, historian and Scottish nationalist, said on the program. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a retired diplomat, said: `` I think we're at very grave risk of ceasing to exist as a recognizable nation, as a recognizable culture and identity. The species is under threat.'' While everyone saw a problem, there was little agreement on the cause. Newspaper columnist <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ascherson </PERSON> said most of the institutions mentioned were recent creations copied from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` The idea of cultural bureaucracies is entirely alien to <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This is not a country which has traditionally been kind to the arts.'' Some said Scots were reluctant to protest `` Englishing'' for fear of sounding racist. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, editor of the left-wing journal `` Radical <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>,'' said this fear had deprived Scots of `` the confidence to stand up and argue that there is a problem.'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Massie </PERSON>, a conservative writer, offered simple arithmetic: `` Because of the population ratio, if you have a job that is publicly advertised and you have 10 applicants, you're quite likely to find that seven of them come from outside <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, an Englishman who heads the National Gallery of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, called the program `` absolute arrant nonsense.'' He said just as many Scots run English institutions, but <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> reported no Scots among 34 university heads in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, and said only two of the 21 state-funded museums, art galleries and libraries south of the border were run by <ORGANIZATION> Scots </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> argued that `` An Englishman sometimes understands more and can better identify the Scottishness of something than a Scot can.'' The program, too, paid tribute to the many non-Scots who have fostered Scottish art forms the Scots themselves had neglected. Overall, however, <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON>'s presentation painted a gloomy portrait of a culture hijacked by outsiders. It inspired a deluge of commentary and letters that complained of `` Englishing'' in everything from soccer through architecture to the Englishisms creeping into everyday speech in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The Advisory Council for the Arts in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> weighed in with worry about `` the survival of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> as anything more than a geographical expression.'' <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> said the letters ran 8-2 in support of his conclusions, which are that `` certain jobs should be reserved for people who are educated and brought up in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and understand the nuances of Scottish culture.'' He acknowledges the impossibility of barring Englishmen from jobs in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> since both are part of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, but added in an interview: `` It's similarly daft that so many such jobs are being taken by non-Scots. That's the ambivalence of our whole constitutional situation.'' The broadcast coincides with a broadly based campaign for limited independence that is gathering support in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` There does seem to be a fairly stronger feeling of nationalism again,'' <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> said. `` I think Scots have a pendulum consciousness that swings from feeling British to feeling Scottish, and in my opinion it's swinging toward Scottishness now.''

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> lost a large amount of blood early today but was in stable condition after being given emergency blood transfusions, palace officials said. Doctors gave the frail 87-year-old monarch a total of 1.3 pints of blood overnight to compensate for the bleeding, the officials said. It was the largest amount of blood the emperor has lost since he discharged close to 2.1 pints from his bowels on Oct. 1, news reports said. <PERSON> Iwao </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyao </PERSON>, vice grand steward of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said there had been no new discharge as of this afternoon, but doctors were ready to administer more blood at any time. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has been in serious condition since Sept. 19 when his internal bleeding, thought to be coming from his upper intestine, caused him to vomit a large amount of blood. Doctors believe the discharge this morning came from blood that had accumulated over time from his internal hemorrhaging, palace officials said. Palace spokesman <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> told reporters the world's oldest living monarch was `` in stable condition and fully conscious.'' He said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> had eaten small amounts of porridge during the past four days, the first food he has had since Oct. 1. Doctors have been concerned about the emperor's declining nutritional status caused by his intraveneous feeding, which is unable to provide enough nutrients. Today's transfusions brought the total amount of blood <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has received since his condition worsened to 19.8 pints, reportedly about twice the total amount of blood in his body. The emperor underwent an intestinal bypass operation a year ago after an enlarged pancreas put pressure on his intestine, blocking the passage of food. Imperial Household officials said then he was suffering from chronic pancreatitis and no signs of pancreatic cancer were found.

 Gunmen wearing military-style uniforms shot and stabbed six people to death in eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, an army spokesman said today. The official, who can not be identified under briefing rules, said four Tamil and two Sinhalese men were shot and stabbed late Monday in the village of <LOCATION> Seyiliyamadu </LOCATION>, about 175 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the island's capital. The official said the slayings could have been done by either militant Tamils fighting for a separate nation in the northeastern province or extremist Sinhalese opposed to the government's peace overtures to the Tamil rebels. Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, comprise 18 percent of the island's 16 million people. Militant Tamils have been fighting since 1983 for an independent homeland in the northeast. A peace accord aimed at ending the 5-year-old insurgency offered Tamils limited automony in the region, and election of a provincial council is scheduled for Nov. 19. In exchange, Tamil rebels must surrender their weapons and end the fighting that has claimed at least 8,500 lives. The most militant group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ealam </ORGANIZATION>, accepted the agreement after it was signed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in July 1987. They reneged three months later, saying it did not meet enough demands, and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent an estimated 47,000 troops to the island to put down the rebellion. Radicals in the Sinhalese community, which makes up 75 percent of the island's population and controls the government, also oppose the peace accord. They claim it grants too many concessions to the Tamils. They have vowed to kill anyone who supports the agreement and have been blamed for more than 500 deaths in the past year, including members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

The index lost 28.41 points in its early trading and continued falling at a slower pace. Monday's closing Nikkei was 27,268.74 points. News that the emperor received an emergency blood transfusion today caused many buyers to wait on the sidelines, traders said. `` Obviously, it's because of the emperor's ... blood transfusion,'' said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage, speaking anonymously `` Participants were less motivated in investing, which resulted in thin trading,'' he said, adding the news affected the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market more than any economic factor. Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 400 million shares. Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, 87, received the transfusion after he passed a large amount of blood overnight and Monday morning.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, likely heading to trial next week on federal perjury charges, said he will resign from office if he is convicted but expressed confidence he would be exonerated. A federal grand jury on Monday indicted the two-term Republican on 10 counts of perjury, saying he lied during a money laundering investigation. He pleaded innocent and was freed on his recognizance. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who will represent himself, moved quickly to schedule his trial next week so the case could be resolved before the Nov. 8 election. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> said he would reschedule another trial to hear the <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> case Monday if the congressman filed the appropriate motion. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is seeking his third term representing a suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> district, and he vowed to clear himself before the election. But he said he would resign if convicted `` because under the circumstances, I do n't think it would be fair to the voters of the 4th District'' to remain in office. His Democratic opponent, former `` Dukes of Hazzard'' television actor <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, said, `` I feel concern for the congressman and for his family at this point. ... It is a matter for the courts to decide.'' The indictment accused <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> of lying to the grand jury Feb. 2 during its investigation of a proposed $ 850,000 home mortgage loan the congressman had discussed with businessman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and an undercover agent posing as a financier. <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and four others have been charged with money laundering. The indictment charged that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> lied when he told the panel he did not go to authorities to report the loan negotiations because, `` I never satisfied myself of anything with respect to criminality.'' It also said he lied when he said there had never been discussions about trying to conceal the trail of the money, and when he denied having been specifically informed by the undercover agent that the source of the loan could be illicit drug money. If convicted, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> could be sentenced to five years in prison and fined $ 10,000 on each count, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> has acknowledged an error in judgment in dealing with <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, but denied criminal wrongdoing and characterized any questionable statements to the jury as a memory lapse. The congressman, who is an attorney, decried what he claimed were political overtones to the case. `` This is a political lunch, this is a political case, it will be a political trial, it'll be a political exoneration,'' he said. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, also a Republican, said the case was n't politically motivated. <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> had been scheduled to hear the trial of <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and another defendant Monday, and his willingness to delay that case to speed up <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s trial was criticized by <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kish </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kish </PERSON> said he may consider ending negotiations on a plea agreement under which LeChasney would cooperate with prosecutors. `` There was no hurry in this case when my client sat in the Douglas County Jail for three weeks,'' the lawyer said. `` All of a sudden, everyone's falling all over themselves to get a defendant to trial, as long as it's a congressman of the same political party as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, especially right before an election.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who defeated <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> in 1986, this year has made an issue of <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' arrest record, including a conviction for assaulting his wife. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> has said the incidents occurred during a bout with alcoholism that ended in 1977. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who starred as `` Cooter'' in the long-running series, `` The Dukes of Hazzard,'' once suggested that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> submit to drug tests, insinuating the congressman's behavior was unstable.

 A tractor-trailer carrying 200 beehives ran off a busy highway and flipped over, releasing up to 250,000 honeybees into rush-hour traffic, authorities said. The spill snarled traffic Monday afternoon as drivers nearing the intersection of Interstates 75 and 285 northwest of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> were warned in radio newscasts to roll up windows to avoid being stung. A thick cloud of bees swarmed over the highways as they were unable to return to their demolished hives. Wooden cartons containing the hives were strewn over a 250-yard stretch near the accident on I-75. Private beekeepers were called in to coax the bees back into what few intact hives remained. `` I was on my way home and heard this on the radio and went home to suit up,'' <LOCATION> Cherokee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> beekeeper <PERSON> Mace </PERSON> <PERSON> McGill </PERSON> said as bees crawled over his netted helmet. Most of the swarm had dissipated by late Monday and there were no reports of serious sting injuries. The driver of the truck, <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, was listed in stable condition in a hospital for accident injuries and a passenger, <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosley </PERSON>, was treated and released, officials said. `` We were on the ground and we started to run and we got the bees in our hair but they did n't sting us,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bosley </PERSON> said.

But he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today that the academy had sent him a letter reversing its decision. The letter said `` relevant leaders were dissatisfied'' with comments <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> made during a recent trip to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, he said. He spent three weeks in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in August and September on an academic visit and spent a week in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> on his way back. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, said the letter also accused <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> of spreading rumors and said he should have gotten academy approval for the stop in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said he wrote to the academy denying its accusations and reapplying to go. `` Whether leaders are happy or not should not affect normal scientific exchanges,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> quoted him as saying in the letter. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> confirmed that in an informal meeting with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> he mentioned rumors that many Chinese leaders and their children maintain foreign bank accounts. The official <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> challenged <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> to defend his comments when he arrived in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said the rumors are `` very common, even among the students I talked to in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' and that he made no public accusations against officials.

However, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said he stands by his comments both in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and abroad criticizing Marxism and one-party rule. `` Everything has a beginning and an end.

 A woman has been jailed for refusing to testify against her husband in a family molestation investigation a week after one of their daughters was ordered jailed for not testifying.

A 1987 amendment to the law prohibits couples from invoking the privilege when a child is the victim of a crime and a parent is accused, said prosecutor <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Johstono </PERSON>. When the judge asked the woman if she understood the consequences of not cooperating, she replied, `` I understand that there is an abuse of power going on here.'' <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> ordered the woman jailed on $ 100,000 bond. Last week, <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> ordered the couple's 18-year-old daughter to jail for refusing to testify. She remained jailed Monday. The 16-year-old daughter has been allowed not testify because she is emotionally unable to, authorities said. The couple, who has two other daughters and two sons, has criticized authorities for prosecuting the case, saying officials are trying to tear their family apart. The woman said her Mormon faith, which is committed to maintaining the family unit, prevents her from testifying. Her husband is charged with multiple counts of child molestation, aggravated child molestation and sodomy, and one count of aggravated sodomy. He is free on $ 25,000 bond. Defense attorney <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Leipold </PERSON> has repeatedly objected to <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>'s attempts to compel testimony in the case <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> has been attempting to take testimony to determine if allegations made four years ago by the two daughters are admissible.

 Leaders of three mainstream Jewish groups have charged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s chief lobbying organization in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is out of step with `` the consensus of the organized Jewish community,'' a newspaper reported today. The leaders of the three organizations made the charge in a letter addressed to <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said.

The letter, according to the Times, said <PERSON> Aipac </PERSON> did not represent `` the consensus of the organized Jewish community'' on important <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> issues. The six said they disagreed with <ORGANIZATION> Aipac </ORGANIZATION>'s opposition to arms sales to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>; its efforts to shut down the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> mission; and its effort to deny <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper reported. The letter says that the three organizations have established, `` a joint political committee for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' to arrange for the presentation of their testimony before congressional committees and government agencies, the Times said. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON>, national director of the <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION>, said late Monday, `` I think the letter is a desire on our part to better the relationship between <ORGANIZATION> Aipac </ORGANIZATION> and the three agencies.

He noted that the three organizations, which have headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, already maintain offices in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> so it was not as if they were `` setting up anything new.'' It is not their intention, he added, `` to set up as a competing group or to duplicate what'' <ORGANIZATION> Aipac </ORGANIZATION> does. The three groups already are represented on <ORGANIZATION> Aipac </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee, a policy-making body of about 150 people that meets four times a year. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Aipac </ORGANIZATION> officer quoted anonymously told the Times: `` More consultation is always desirable, but the establishment of a second lobbying entity would undermine the effectiveness of the pro-Israel community in presenting its case to public officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and elsewhere.''

 This community was in shock over the suicides of two 15-year-old boys who police said shared a hunting rifle to kill themselves out of despondency at being separated when one of their families moved away. <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principal </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> tried to prepare teachers and staff members to deal with student suicide threats and attempts, staging a `` simulation suicide exercise'' two weeks ago to rehearse a proper response. `` Even though we were prepared, it was a shock,'' said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 53, a principal 12 years. The bodies of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruczkowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollis </PERSON>, who recently moved with his family 70 miles north to <LOCATION> Malone </LOCATION>, were found by <PERSON> Kruczkowski </PERSON>'s mother in the attic of their home Sunday evening. `` They were best of friends and they had been separated,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slamka </PERSON> said. `` The kid from up north had come down to visit for the weekend, and it was when the father came to pick him up that the bodies were discovered.'' Evidence showed both boys died from a single shot to the head, and the wounds appeared to be self-inflicted, <PERSON> Slamka </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kruczkowski </PERSON> shot himself first, police said. According to the medical examiner's report, the boys left two printed notes addressed to their parents. One note said they decided to end their lives because they could no longer be separated from their friends and each other, the report said. The second note instructed the parents to listen to a tape recording that explained the decision, it said. Police declined to release the words of the notes or tape, which <PERSON> Slamka </PERSON> said ran no more than a minute. `` This was n't spontaneous,'' <PERSON> Slamka </PERSON> said. `` It was planned, though I'm not sure how long it was pre-planned.'' The bodies were discovered after <PERSON> Bollis </PERSON>' father came to the home and met <PERSON> Kruczkowski </PERSON>'s mother. She went to the attic of the wood-frame house, where her son lived with his father, and found the bodies, <PERSON> Slamka </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kruczkowski </PERSON>'s parents are divorced. The .30 -06 - caliber rifle was owned by the <PERSON> Kruczkowski </PERSON>'s father, who also had other rifles in There was no evidence that the boys had used drugs or alcohol, the chief said. `` In fact, I'm not aware of any problems with the two of them.'' <PERSON> Slamka </PERSON> said he could not recall another case of a multiple suicide in his 25 years on the force. `` From time to time we have gunshot suicides and young people are involved,'' he said. `` Each time it's especially tragic, and in the event of a double suicide, it multiplies the loss and the concern you have for these people.'' Early Monday, <PERSON> Slamka </PERSON> sent his school liaison officer to the high school to meet with the principal. The deaths were announced over the public address system and students were told counselors were available to help them. Similar steps were taken at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 70 miles north of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bollis </PERSON> was a student, officials said. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwaller </PERSON>, a social worker for the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, said the guidance counselor office was `` hopping all morning'' with students wishing to talk about the deaths. Teachers were told about the shootings and were urged to be open with students should they ask what happened, he said. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> also had to inform students Monday of the death of a math teacher, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, 44, from a heart attack Saturday. Funeral services were scheduled for <PERSON> Kruczkowski </PERSON> on Wednesday evening and for <PERSON> Bollis </PERSON> on Thursday.

<TEXT>
 Three escaped detainees encamped in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate for more than a month plan to leave their sanctuary Wednesday, an anti-apartheid labor federation said today. The three prominent activists, who escaped detention Sept. 13, have been living in the consulate on the 11th floor of a downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> office building. The South African government has said the trio is free to leave and it will not redetain or restrict the men in any way. The decision for the men to leave `` is a major test of the government's undertaking and will once again bring the spotlight on the detention and persecution of anti-apartheid activists,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions said in a staement. The congress is the country's largest black labor organization and is a militant opponent of apartheid. The anti-apartheid leaders are <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohanned </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, leaders of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Vusi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khanyile </PERSON>, chairman of the banned <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Khanyile </PERSON> are black, <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> is of Indian descent. All had been held more than a year without charge when they slipped away from guards while undergoing physiotherapy at a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> hospital. `` The three have called the state's bluff and intend to leave,'' the congress statement said. `` We do not for a moment believe that the government intended releasing them and that they somehow pre-empted this by their escape,'' it added. `` This government line was meant to appease the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration and dilute public and international concern over detentions.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they would not force the three to leave despite a worldwide <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of not allowing diplomatic offices to be used by those seeking asylum. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have maintained a low profile during the episode and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavis </PERSON> said he had no immediate comment on the matter. Earlier the activists had said they do not trust the government and repeated their call for the release of other political detainees. An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without trial for varying lengths of time under the 28-month-old state of emergency. About 1,000 people currently are believed to be in detention. Most are being held for political activism. An activist who escaped Sept. 21 to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON>, left the refuge earlier to obtain medical treatment, his law firm said. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 A crowd of people seeking jobs trampled seven people to death today in the East Java capital of <LOCATION> Surabaya </LOCATION>, police said. A Surabaya police officer said hundreds of young men and women suddenly started pushing and shoving after lining up since early in the morning to present their applications for jobs offered by the governor's office. `` Apparently some of them became impatient. Two men and five women were killed in the melee,'' said an officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said a number of other people were injured but gave no figure. No arrests were made and police were investigating the causes of the incident, he said. No further details were immediately available.

<HEAD>Customers May Find Fewer Big Jack-O'-Lanterns After Drought</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Vana </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCost </PERSON> says her customers can get the great pumpkin _ but they'll have to shop early. Drought has reduced the number of jumbo jack-o'lanterns in her eight-acre patch as in other areas of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` The decorative pumpkin crop is short and people -LRB- in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> -RRB- will be paying more than usual for large pumpkins,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>, a pumpkin specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. `` The problem area is as wide as the drought.'' Pumpkin growers in the East have a good crop, but shipping them to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> is expensive and adds to the price, <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> said. Decorative pumpkins are grown on smaller plots, usually near urban areas. And because farmers often can not afford to irrigate, the drought can cause significant damage. This year, seed failed to germinate in the sun-baked Midwestern soil, and vines that did grow either failed to produce as many pumpkins, or produced smaller fruit than in previous years. <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> said many growers in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> realized their crop would be smaller when the vines started dying and uncovering the fruit. `` It will be the late shopper who has problems. The last week before Halloween could be tight,'' Mrs. <PERSON> LaCost </PERSON>, whose farm is near <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>, predicted Monday. She said she has kept pace with demand so far and the quality of her pumpkins is good, but the drought cut her volume in half. She would not specify her prices, but said they are a little higher than last year. Consumers wo n't have to worry about a shortage of canned pumpkins for holiday pies, say officials in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, which leads the country with about 5,000 acres of the commercially canned product. `` We had a super year,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrs </PERSON>, plant manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Libby </ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> Carnation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Libby </PERSON> processes about 100,000 tons of pumpkins a year at its Morton plant <PERSON> Rohrs </PERSON> said the size of the pumpkins was smaller than usual, but the amount of fruit available was excellent. He said <PERSON> Libby </PERSON>'s variety was deep-rooted and survived the summer drought well. However, about 40 percent of <PERSON> Libby </PERSON>'s growers use irrigation. `` Our pumpkins were the best they ever were,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tazewell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> farmer who raises 180 acres of pumpkins for <LOCATION> Libby </LOCATION> on irrigated land. He said his yields ranged from 33 tons per acre to nearly 41 tons per acre, and <PERSON> Libby </PERSON> paid $ 17 a ton for the crop.

<HEAD>Chairman, Chavez Quit U.S. English Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of a group that wants English to be the nation's official language says he resigned to let voters focus on the issue instead of on allegations about his ties to advocates of forced sterilization. The controversy has `` come to center more around me in the last week or 10 days,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON> said Monday. He said his resignation from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English, which he co-founded, would give him time to fight accusations. His decision followed announcements by former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> newsman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> that they were severing their ties with the organization. Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said Monday she was quitting because she had been told that some major contributors to <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON>'s other interests advocated unusual views on population and immigration control, including advocacy of forced sterilization. `` To me it is just not consistent with the views I hold,'' she said. <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> resigned from the advisory board to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English on Oct. 6 after learning of a 2-year-old <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON> memo. That memo, distributed at a 1986 immigration conference, posed a series of questions and depicted an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> possibly doomed to conflict between a minority of educated well-off English speakers and a majority of uneducated poor people of other ethnic and racial groups with faster population growth. <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON> on Monday described the memo as `` a compilation of questions and views of many observers on complex and controversial issues.'' `` Our opponents have falsely charged that it reflects the views of myself or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English and its positions on these initiatives,'' he added. `` There is no connection between a memo I wrote in 1986 and the initiatives for the ballot in November 1988.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English backs measures in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> next month. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s Proposition 106, if approved, would change the state constitution to designate English as the state's official language and limit government use of foreign languages in courts, meetings and schools. Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said at least one major contributor to U.S. English helped reprint `` an awful, awful book'' called `` Camp of the Saints,'' which she described as `` a paranoid fantasy'' about `` undesirables of the Third World'' taking over developed nations. She said she had been told that <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON>'s activities with immigration and population-control groups involved some who may have given money to `` groups that may be involved in eugenics research.'' She said one person favored forced sterilization but she did not elaborate. <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON> said he did not know who the people <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> was talking about. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English gets most of its funds from <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> corporation run by <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON>'s wife and two <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> men. Records show <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> gets most of its funds from direct-mail solicitation but do not identify the contributors. `` We have never had any sort of a litmus test when somebody has wanted to contribute,'' <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON> said in an interview, adding that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> had 168,000 donors this year and 379,000 since it was founded. He said he would continue to head <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as an `` incubator for new ideas,'' and that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English had been given mailing lists and would be able to operate independently. Supporters of Proposition 106 say it would unify the state and help minorities join the mainstream more quickly. Critics say it would disrupt the operation of civil courts, English-proficiency classes, and tourism and commerce with other countries. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English, through its campaign-finance arm, has contributed $ 160,603, or about 97 percent of total contributions in support of Prop 106, according to the latest available records. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Meek </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> opponents of Prop 106, said he viewed the <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON> resignation as `` largely cosmetic'' because <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON> retained control of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and because he was being replaced as chairman of U.S. English by board member <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION>, `` one of his strongest supporters.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English was founded in 1983 by <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON> and former Sen. S.I. <PERSON> Hayakawa </PERSON>, R-Calif.

 Federal investigators are looking into the affairs of 40 banks across the country and expect to turn up `` a couple'' more that have engaged in money laundering for drug dealers, Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said today. `` It's just amazing what happens when you turn over a rock as big as this,'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. `` We've got our agents in 40 banks around the country, as well as this bank in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. There are British agents in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> agents in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, and there's just voluminous material, all of which is more or less bearing out what we expected to find,'' he said. `` We expect to see a lot of indictments coming out of this,'' he said. The indictment last week of a bank holding company has not halted such money handling, <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. `` We're looking at as much as $ 50 billion a year that is laundered overseas. So this bank, at best, could have laundered only a hundredth of that.'' `` We have n't put a stop to it yet,'' he said. But the indictment of the Florida-based <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> is `` a very important part of a cure.'' `` No doubt there are other banks like this,'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> went on. `` There is $ 50 billion that someone has to launder, one bank ca n't do the job As to whether there are other banks that know they're doing this and are doing it intentionally, I really ca n't give you that answer `` We've got a lot of investigations; we'll probably turn up a couple.'' The charge in this case is that the bank knew what it was doing, that it knew it was dealing with drug money and that it was intentionally laundering the proceeds, he explained. Why would a bank do that, he was asked. `` Banks want the money,'' he observed. Altogether, 85 defendants have been indicted in the investigation. Indictments were returned in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. In addition, arrest warrants were issued in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in the case involving the laundering of money for the powerful Colombian drug cartel. Money laundering is the process of transferring money obtained illegally between businesses or banks in order to obscure its origin and to make it appear to have been earned in a legal manner.

 When the gray-haired, aristocratic Texan stood before the black political activists in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state capitol, they could not have been prepared for what followed. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, was funny. `` I'm one of only two folks in this crowd who knows where <LOCATION> Mineola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is,'' he said, referring to the native town of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who had given him a warm introduction at the session last week. `` <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> is one of my few friends who has an office larger than his home town.'' He joked about the flashy <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s penchant for Ferraris and fast driving. Then, in another joke, he neatly summed up his predicament. `` <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> think's I'm a little ... -LRB- pause -RRB- ... dull,'' he said. `` The problem I've got with <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ he thinks I'm too flamboyant.'' `` That's the way it is when you're running for vice president,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, at age 67, seems to have found stride. Even as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign appears to sink, he campaigns with increasing confidence and humor. In the nearly two weeks since he bested Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in their debate, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has acquired a smoother delivery and, it seems, new respect from the electorate. Everywhere he goes, people ask him: How would he like to be the head of the ticket. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who once failed miserably in seeking the presidency himself 12 years ago, now just chuckles. `` We've got a very able man at the head of that ticket and I'm delighted to be on it with him,'' he said in an interview Monday `` He's tough, he's intelligent, he has complete integrity and he's a proven product with the fine job he's done in the state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has any doubts about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he keeps them under wraps. But he has learned the frustration of being the second half of a presidential ticket. He sees it every day in the polls _ polls that show his own popularity superb but the Democrats losing his native <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by a double-digit margin. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> stubbornly insists he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will manage to carry the Lone Star state. `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is still a major priority, I'm going to spend a great deal of time down there. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is scheduled back into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It stays a high priority,'' he said. But in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and elsewhere, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is like a .300 hitter on a team with a pitcher who ca n't throw strikes. As his career winds down, political fans speak well of his candidacy, but he ca n't bring home the pennant <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> often points to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as an example of his leadership, comparing his choice to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s campaign schedule, concocted by the governor's aides in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, seems like an afterthought, with many hastily-thrown-together and poorly executed events. Last Friday, he spent nine hours in the air so he could introduce <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at a rally in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. He saw the biggest crowds of the campaign when he rode in a parade at a <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> reservation in northwest <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Tens of thousands of people lined the route near <LOCATION> Shiprock </LOCATION>, but reporters walking alongside him heard the same question all along the route `` Who is he?'' The campaign had neglected to hand out leaflets to the crowd before he came. Last Saturday night, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> visited an ethnic area of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and spoke to supporters, mostly <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> fans of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a church hall. Even his own staff was puzzled by the stop. `` Out of those 600 people, there were probably two undecideds,'' quipped one top aide. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> himself refrains from criticizing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> directly. He has grumbled about the governor being too slow to respond to the attacks from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, and hints he would have answered key questions in the last Dukakis-Bush debate differently. `` I'm not going to try to second guess him,'' he said, emphasizing that the campaign had to focus on the three weeks ahead. He wo n't say what advice he's given <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, only that some has been taken and some has been rejected. Clearly, his stance is an aggressive one. `` Down in my country, politics is a contact sport,'' he's fond of saying. But as <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was leaving that black political meeting in the statehouse in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, he was almost wistful as he wished them well and bid them adieu. `` I'm going back on the road,'' he told <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` And I'll write if I find work.

<TEXT>
 Laborers working round-the-clock today finished piecing together a statue of Gen. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> four days after vandals blasted it with dynamite. World War II veterans have arrived in this coastal village on <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION> island for a ceremony Thursday marking the day when the American general led <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in liberating the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Oct. 20, 1944. The Americans landed on <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION>, about 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The island is among the poorest in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and communist guerrillas have been active in the region for years. Police said today they believe the blast may have been the work of vandals under the influence of alcohol or narcotics. But they added that they were not ruling out communist rebels as suspects. Damage was so extensive that the reconstructed concrete figure of the general has an disproportionately large left shoulder, giving it the appearance of tipping over. The quick repair job also eliminated the imperial air of the late American four-star general depicted by the original sculpture. Workers reinforced the steel frame of the 10-foot statue to minimize damage in case of a second attack. The statue shows <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION>, flanked by Filipinos and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers, wading ashore on <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION>. `` I think -LRB- the vandalism was -RRB- immoral,'' said <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mescallado </PERSON>, 75, a naturalized American of Filipino descent. `` Maybe -LRB- the vandals -RRB- did n't know that <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> liberated the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> ... They do n't know their history.'' <PERSON> Mescallado </PERSON>, a doctor from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, served under <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> during World War II. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Valerio </PERSON>, 64, an Italian-born American from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas may have attacked the statue to protest the American military presence in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` I do n't feel anything bad about -LRB- the blasting -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Valerio </PERSON> added. `` Everybody has his own ideology.'' Dozens of former Japanese soldiers visited the site today, most of them posing for photographs in front of MacArthur's statue.

<HEAD>Firefighters Confident Wildlife Station Will Be Saved</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Firefighters battling blazes that charred nearly 6,000 acres of brush said they were confident the flames would not burn a shelter for exotic animals or burn the area around giant trees in Sequoia National Park. Barring sudden gusts, the 3,300-acre fire northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> did not present a threat to the Wildlife Way Station or a home for 125 emotionally disturbed children, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderhaar </PERSON>. The flames were 1 -LCB- miles away from the animal shelter and about 3 miles beyond the home for children in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tujunga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, she said. Officials at the wild animal shelter were cautious but confident. `` All the animals are confined, because we ca n't guard a free-roaming animal very well,'' said <PERSON> Martine </PERSON> <PERSON> Colette </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the animal shelter about 30 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The shelter houses alligators, tigers, bears, horses, giraffes and a variety of other abandoned exotic pets and wild animals that wandered into neighborhoods. The fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, which was 30 percent contained as of early today, forced evacuations of seven homes. Two firefighters suffered minor injuries while battling the blaze, which officials estimated will be surrounded at 6 p.m. Wednesday and extinguished 24 hours later. More than 800 firefighters were aided by nine air tankers and three helicopters that began dropping water and fire-retardant chemicals at dawn Monday as the blaze burned dry brush in inaccessible mountainous terrain. Three <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> men were booked on $ 2,500 bail for investigation of starting a forest fire with an illegal campfire, but they were released Monday and no charges were to be filed, said Deputy <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> of the Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` It appears a 10-year-old boy has admitted to it,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. `` He told arson investigators he started a campfire that got out of control.'' The fire was one of several _ including a 1,500-acre fire near trees up to 2,700 years old in <LOCATION> Sequoia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> _ that erupted during the weekend as an autumn heat wave blasted <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with temperatures near 100 degrees in some areas and sent dry desert winds gusting to 30 mph. In Sequoia, 600 firefighters worked to make sure the fires kept away from the 3-square-mile <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, a grove of trees considered the largest living things on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON>. The fire was burning away from the trees as of today, she said. The trees can generally survive forest fires because their soft bark can withstand considerable heat and flame, although `` a sequoia tree is fire-resistant, not fireproof,'' Case said. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, other blazes consumed about 1,300 acres of brush.

 World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> today indicated <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will pay reparations to Holocaust victims and their families. He also said he hoped for improved contacts between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The two countries never have had diplomatic relations. `` I have been given the understanding that serious consideration is being given to some renewal of relationship between the two countries and I hope that will happen in the not-too-distant future,'' <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> said. Before his meeting Tuesday with East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> said he expected his three-day visit to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> would lead to a reparations agreement for Jewish victims. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had said it would provide unspecified humanitarian aid to Holocaust victims. At a news conference in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> at the end of his trip, <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> declined to be specific on exactly what compensation he expects. `` I have had very good, clear meetings here,'' <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> said. `` I am totally satisfied on two counts. The first is the one that concerns me the most. That is the moral position that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is taking on its responsibilities on the Holocaust. The second point is payment to the sufferers and survivors.'' <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> also referred to an international claims conference backed by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that has handled reparations issues for Holocaust victims. `` I understand that the negotiations that took place between the government and claims conference have been completed,'' he said. `` They will be lived up to and the details and communications will be worked out and reported.'' `` I am completely satisifed with the results,'' <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> added. `` I have nothing further to say on the payments question. It is not my responsibility to discuss the details.'' Toward the end of the news conference, a reporter called out a question about West German Jewish leaders' statements that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would pay up to $ 100 million to Holocaust victims. `` The 100 million was not part of my mission,'' <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> responded. There was no immediate statement on the reparations issue from the official East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>. The news agency has been providing extensive coverage of <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>'s visit. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the talks were `` open and constructive'' and added that <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s efforts to educate its young people about the Holocaust. `` The struggle against racism and anti-Semitism belongs to the anti-fascist tradition of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> said Monday. `` We will never forget that many Jews, together with communists and Social Democrats ... were active in the struggle against the Nazi dictatorship,'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> said, according to ADN. <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> has said that an admission of shared responsibility for the Holocaust was as important as financial contributions to victims, and that the money was a `` token thing.'' `` What is at stake here is moral culpability,'' he said. More than 6 million Jews were killed during <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich. However, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has argued that it bears no reponsibility for <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> atrocities because the nation was created after World War II ended. In 1952, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> signed an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to compensate Holocaust victims and families. Since then, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has paid more than $ 48 billion to Holocaust survivors.

<HEAD>Ford Estate Settlement Falls Through; Heirs May Fight It Out At
Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Last-minute objections scuttled a proposed settlement on how to distribute <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> II's $ 350 million estate, meaning heirs may have to go to trial. The settlement had appeared a certainty when opposing parties arrived at <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. But attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s grandchildren, who wo n't benefit from the trust until after the death of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 48-year-old widow, raised objections. `` I've heard enough,'' Judge <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudnick </PERSON> said after listening to several of the more than a dozen attorneys unravel the deal. `` I can not approve an agreement at this date.'' Unless a new agreement is reached, there will have to be more hearings and possibly a trial that the privacy-conscious family has been trying to avoid. `` We're back to square A,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, one of four attorneys representing the widow, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> DuRoss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. She is to receive at least $ 1.5 million a year under the terms of her husband's vast trust, which is at the center of the squabbling. Only minutes before the settlement breakdown, <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> had been holding an impromptu news conference in which he said the bitter disagreements aired in the court file and at a hearing in August had been resolved. Everyone is happy now, everyone has signed the settlement agreement, attirbetls said. By settling, the workings of the trust could once again become a private matter, as <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION> had wished it would be. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> died at age 70 on Sept. 29, 1987, in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. He filed his will, which contained little information, in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which was his legal residence. The attorneys would reveal little of the settlement agreement beyond saying that Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s third wife, would withdraw her objections to investor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>'s becoming a trustee. The dispute erupted when Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> objected to the selection of <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, a former undersecretary of state, as a trustee to help manage the vast estate. She had argued that his proposed $ 1 million a year fee for management expertise was excessive. Attorneys would not say how much he would be paid if the settlement is approved.

<TEXT>
 The president today warned of `` great danger'' for the country if <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders do not stop arguing over ethnic and social unrest that have stirred up <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s worst postwar crisis. Leaders from the country's two largest republics, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, clashed openly as the party's 162-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> met today for a second day to discuss personnel and policy changes. `` The way out of the crisis is not in extraordinary measures but in a change of behavior,'' President <PERSON> Raif </PERSON> <PERSON> Dizdarevic </PERSON> told the session, referring to unspecified actions he threatened to take last week if workers continued to stage mass rallies fueled by economic and ethnic problems. `` The lack of unity in the leadership, multiplying of late, is a great danger for the country,'' he added. `` <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is front-page news all around the world, unfortunately in a negative way.'' <PERSON> Dizdarevic </PERSON> spoke to the country's top leaders, including <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, who planned to end the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> session today with a vote of confidence in 10 members of the 23-member ruling Politburo. <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrhovec </PERSON>, one of nine members of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s federal presidency, attacked <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, whose supporters have dominated the rallies. Using a statement <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> allegedly made to an Austrian weekly, Vrhovec _ who is from the republic of <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> _ demanded that <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> use his influence to stop the denunciations of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders in the media and at the protests. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> countered that he had never made the statement or given any interview to foreign media. Vrhovec apologized. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Katjusa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasari </PERSON>, told the meeting the only way to solve the problems of her backward southern province was for the ethnic Albanian majority to unite with the Slav minority in confronting economic problems. The Slavs claim they are harassed by the ethnic Albanians. During Monday's session, <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> backed a market-oriented economic reform program being considered by Parliament to fight the 217 percent annual inflation rate and $ 21 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> on Monday launched an impassioned defense of the mass rallies that have fanned ethnic unrest and party disunity. <PERSON> Marko </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlandic </PERSON>, the party chief of the southern republic of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, said 10 members of the Politburo are expected to face today's vote of confidence, including party chief <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Orlandic </PERSON> said the 10 will need at least two-thirds of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> votes to retain their seats on the ruling body. The confidence vote will be conducted by secret ballot, he said. It will not apply to the four Presidium members who announced prior to the current <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that they would resign, he said. It also does not apply to nine members of the 23-man ruling body who hold their seats as party leaders of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>' a six republics and two provinces, and the armed forces. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who has antagonized non-Serbs, is among those exempt from the vote of confidence. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> is trying to extend Serbian control over his republic's two autonomous provinces of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> insisted Monday that `` <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> has no claims to the territory of other republics. It does have claim to territory in its own republic.'' <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s drive has brought him into unprecedented open conflict with <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of the northern republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON>. The three men are <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most important communist leaders On Monday, <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> lent unreserved support to <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>'s appeal for unity and economic reform to ease social tensions. The economic reform program has been worked out by the government under Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>, who survived a vote of confidence in May but came under severe criticism Monday for failing to control the economic crisis.

 A state judge dismissed a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> that sought $ 1 billion in damages for victims of the 1984 toxic gas leak in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, that killed more than 2,000 people.

The lawsuit claimed that a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> statute allows lawsuits over incidents that happened in foreign countries to be filed in state district courts. Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON>, who represented <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> in the case, had argued that the case clearly should be tried in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. `` The accident happened in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>; it was an Indian subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>; all of the evidence is in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>,'' he said. Several federal lawsuits involving the accident, which occurred when a cloud of toxic gas escaped from the Union Carbide chemical plant in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, have been consolidated and sent to an Indian court. Others are pending in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s home state, <PERSON> Musslewhite </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Musslewhite </PERSON> said he filed the lawsuit in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has statutes allowing for punitive damages in such cases and has many potential jurors acquainted with the hazards of living near chemical plants.

<HEAD>Du Pont Admits Underreporting Waste Amount</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Officials at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plutonium plant said an `` oversight'' was responsible for underreporting of the amount of radioactive contaminant released into a creek, according to reports published today. According to a Sept. 21 report by <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the plant, a 375,000-gallon release on July 8 was contaminated by 17 millicuries of Cesium-137, a waste byproduct known to cause cancer. However, officials continued to collect data through mid-September, and those updated numbers were n't in the report, The <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> -RRB- Chronicle and The <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions The Sept. 21 report, obtained by the newspapers last week, said the 17-millicuries figure was based on data collected only through July 22. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> officials increased the figure to 26 millicuries of Cesium-137. A millicurie is one-thousandth of a curie, the unit used to measure radioactivity. The report of an unusual occurrence at the plant was prepared July 25 and revised Sept. 16. `` The revisions should, or could, have included the change,'' said plant spokesman <PERSON> Clif </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. `` It was an oversight. The data was available but it was not used.'' The change, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said, did not make any difference in terms of public safety or health. The report had to be completed within three weeks of the accident, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said, adding it was later revised as additional information became available. Poorly trained personnel and inadequate procedures were blamed for the water being released into Four Mile Creek, which flows into the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. No abnormal levels of the waste byproduct were detected in the river, according to <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> environmental officials. The shutdown since April of all three reactors at the plant for maintenance and testing has raised safety questions about the plant, which <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> operates for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. In another incident, about 100 plant employees were evacuated Monday afternoon when a fan malfunctioned in the plutonium-processing area, but officials said the workers were not endangered. The fan was restarted about 30 minutes later, said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. The cause of the equipment failure was under investigation. A backup fan normally would have been activated, but the second unit was out of service for routine maintenance, he said. The exhaust fan is used to circulate fresh air through the building and to remove any releases of contamination from the building. The amount of contamination would depend on how much plutonium was being processed when such an accident occurred. Officials will not discuss specifics on plutonium production.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> today ordered a youth to be tried as an adult on charges that he murdered four members of his family with an ax last February when he was 16. The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel reverses the decision last spring of District Court Judge <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ring </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> should be tried as a juvenile. Brom, who turned 17 on Oct. 3, faces four counts of first-degree murder for the slayings of his parents, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, both 41; sister <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, 13; and brother <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>, 11. The family members were found slain in their home north of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> on Feb. 18. An older son who had moved out of the home earlier was not there when the slayings occurred. Brom, a high school sophomore at the time of the slayings, has been undergoing treatment at the <ORGANIZATION> Oaks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a facility for severely disturbed children and adolescents. Psychiatrists at hearings earlier this year described him as severely depresssed. If he had been tried as a juvenile and convicted, he would be released on his 19th birthday. If convicted in adult court, he faces an automatic life sentence, with eligibility for parole after 17 -LCB- years. `` The brutal murders of these four family members has had a major impact on society,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> wrote. `` Retention of the alleged murderer within the criminal justice system for less than three years would constitute an excessively minimal response.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> disagreed with the trial court's contention that the state had failed to show that <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> was not amenable to treatment or that the public safety was not served by retaining him in the juvenile court system.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has the support of black voters and can beat Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the Nov. 8 election if other Democrats work as hard for the ticket as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has. In an interview on `` CBS This Morning,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> disputed any suggestion that he has not worked hard enough for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the man who beat him for the Democratic nomination at the party's <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention in July. `` The fact is, since <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> I've traveled more miles, spoken to more people and registered more voters for this ticket than any Democrat has,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` What ought to happen now is that the other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> team that made commitments in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> ought to pull their weight and together we can win,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he has campaigned more widely for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket than any governor or member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I now appeal to other Democratic leaders in their congressional sphere, in their state sphere, to match that record,'' he said. `` We can win this campaign.'' In the campaign in general, he said, `` my concern is that we're missing issues of substance. When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> proposed a national health care plan for the 37 million Americans who do not have medical insurance, `` that needs more projecting,'' he said. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacks <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over his membership in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and on health insurance and civil rights issues, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` we have both a challenge in Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and an opportunity in Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' As for black support, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` should be able to count on blacks because our civil rights are threatened. ...

 <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>, described as the man who shaped thinking about economics and the state in postwar <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said today he had given up hoping he would win the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economic Science. `` I've been mentioned so many times before I just did n't think I would get it,'' <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>, 77, said at his apartment in the suburb of St. Cloud. Colleagues said <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>, trained as an engineer, changed fields to economics after a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the Depression, when he saw factories idled and men out of work. `` My motivation when I was young was an idea of being able to improve the conditions of life, to try to find a remedy to many of the problems facing the world,'' <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> told a group of reporters. `` That's what led me into economics. I saw it as a way of helping people.'' <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> was working at his home when he received the news he had won. `` It was completely unexpected. It was just mindboggling,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, which awards the prize, said <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> was chosen `` for his pioneering contributions to the theory of markets and efficient utilization of resources.'' Although little-known outside <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> was extremely influential at home, where senior officials in key government ministries and state-owned industries have enormous economic power. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> _ from which <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> officially retired nine years ago, while continuing his research and writing _ said the new laureate had a decisive effect on economic thinking for more than two decades. `` He was the mentor for everyone involved in the economy in postwar <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> between 1945 and 1968, all the people who were in charge of the biggest enterprises and of the state planning apparatus,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. Within the world of French economic thought after World War II _ in which leftists and rightists agreed the state should play a major role in the economy _ <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> established a place for reliance on market forces. He worked on `` a system of definition of prices which would permit the economy to function at its best,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>'s work provided `` a very strong base for those opposed to government direction of the economy,'' said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautman </PERSON>, scientific director for human sciences at <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> said he hoped the Nobel Prize would allow him to continue his work, even though he is past the official retirement age. `` I'm happy to have the Nobel Prize to show how absurd this situation is,'' he said. `` It's amazing that politicians think it's normal that they should not retire, while they think it's normal to push scholars into retirement.

<HEAD>Court to Consider If Flag-Burning a Crime</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts graf 7, The Supreme Court agreed.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will determine whether states may make it a crime to burn the American flag as a symbolic protest, with a potentially far-reaching ruling on freedom of expression expected in 1989. The justices announced Monday that they will review a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> statute that bans desecration of the flag. The case involves a demonstrator who was sentenced to prison for burning a flag in a protest during the 1984 Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> urged the justices not to review a ruling that permitted the flag burning. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> said state officials were trying to `` create a sense of legal uncertainty'' where none exists. While flag-burning generally has not been a hot issue since the days of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War protests, the case may attract considerable attention because of the emphasis on patriotic values during the current presidential campaign. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican nominee, has attacked his Democratic opponent, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, for vetoing a law requiring teachers to lead the Pledge of Allegiance in that state's public schools. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed the bill after receiving an advisory opinion from the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> saying the measure was unconstitutional. In the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> case, a state appeals court last April threw out the flag-burning conviction of <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who had been sentenced to one year in jail and fined $ 2,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed to consider reinstating <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s conviction <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was arrested on Aug. 22, 1984, while participating in a demonstration against the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the Republicans. The protest culminated with a rally in front of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> that included political chants and the flag burning. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was convicted by a jury of violating a state law banning the desecration of a veneraed object. The state appeals court said, `` The act for which -LRB- <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> -RRB- was convicted was clearly ` speech' contemplated by the First Amendment.'' The state court said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law against flag desecration is too broad because it seeks to curb expression likely to cause `` serious offense.'' Seriously offending someone is not the same as inciting to riot _ an activity that permits restraints on free speech, the state court said. It also rejected arguments by law enforcement officials that the anti-desecration statute legitimately preserves the flag `` as a symbol of unity.'' `` Recognizing that the right to differ is the centerpiece of our First Amendment freedoms, a government can not mandate by fiat a feeling of unity in its citizens,'' the state court said. In other action, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>: _ Agreed in a potentially important libel case to review a $ 200,000 award won against an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> newspaper The justices will examine how closely appeals courts must scrutinize jury findings of `` actual malice'' when a public figure sues for libel. _ Said it will hear a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appeal aimed at making it easier for the government to conduct tax-fraud investigations The court will use a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case involving the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientology </ORGANIZATION> to settle a dispute over <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> powers. _ Let stand the espionage and theft convictions of former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence analyst <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Loring </PERSON> <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> for giving secret satellite photographs to a British magzine _ Agreed in a case from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to decide whether states may give larger retirement benefits to public employees based on the age when they are forced to quit work

<TEXT>
 A priest who tried to negotiate an end to the two-week standoff between five conservative nuns and their reform-minded diocese has returned home with his mission unfulfilled. One of the nuns, Sister <PERSON> John </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, who has acted as a spokeswoman for the group, said the nuns would not budge from their Roman Catholic monastery, where they have locked themselves in the infirmary, until they hear directly from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` We are all united here. There's no division among the five,'' she said in a telephone interview Monday from the Monastery of the Most Blessed <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>, located about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Culligan </PERSON>, dispatched by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to try to persuade the nuns and the Diocese of <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION> to resolve their differences, returned home to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> on Monday night. The Carmelite friar said he will submit a report to Cardinal <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamer </PERSON>, an official of the Congregation for Religious and <ORGANIZATION> Secular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` After receiving my report within the next several days, the congregation in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> will make whatever decisions it judges appropriate,'' <ORGANIZATION> Culligan </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The nuns, members of the Order of Discalced Carmelites, oppose what they say are efforts by the monastery's new prioress, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, to modernize the order with the introduction of television, candy and newspapers. The order traditionally has stressed prayer and seclusion. The prioress spoke briefly Monday evening to reporters, saying the protesting nuns would not cooperate with <ORGANIZATION> Culligan </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts even though `` we are all very impressed at -LRB- his -RRB- fairness and sensitivity in handling the situation.'' The sisters, who received official dismissal warnings in June, say they retreated to the infirmary fearing they would be evicted for their dissident views. Four locked themselves in the infirmary Oct. 4 and a fifth joined them a day later. Eight other nuns live at the monastery. <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION> officials say the nuns had earlier agreed to leave. They also say the dispute amounts to a lack of obedience by the nuns and that they could be relieved of their vows. The group broke off talks with <ORGANIZATION> Culligan </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday when <ORGANIZATION> Culligan </ORGANIZATION> refused to discuss whether <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION> officials were working to oust the nuns, Sister <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. But two of the nuns met with him again on Monday, she said.

With <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, it would displace <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, the British-Dutch company, as the world's largest maker of consumer goods. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> revenues for the year that ended June 30 were $ 29 billion, and when added to <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s $ 10.5 billion for the period, the revenues would far outstrip <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 30 billion, according to <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, an analyst who follows consumer producers for <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. In an interview late Monday, <PERSON> Hamish </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive, said, `` Being in the food business, we feel that we understand it. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> are roughly the same size and together would have roughly $ 20 billion in annual revenue. That would make <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> the biggest food company after <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, which had revenue last year of $ 28 billion. The cigarette business generates enormous amounts of cash for <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, but its growth is slowing even though the company has been successful in increasing sales abroad, particularly in developing countries. Tobacco will account for about 78 percent of its earnings this year, compared with 16 percent for General Foods and smaller amounts for <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and other units, said <PERSON> Bierbusse </PERSON>. The dependence on cigarettes has frightened some investors from the stock, analysts said. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said the cigarette business continues to grow in profit, revenue, physical volume and market share and has <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>'s strong support But, he conceded, `` I do n't think most people would pick it as a big growth industry for the future. ... `` We're trying to build our business, and we're also trying to position it for the future and not just for the present or the past.'' Despite the $ 11 billion price, the cigarette and food giant `` can well afford it,'' said <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` Their cash flow is $ 1.3 billion -LRB- a year -RRB-. That's $ 150,000 an hour, 24 hours a day, 366 days a year.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> chairman and chief executive, said its board will meet in `` due course'' to consider the offer. He said the board `` previously concluded that the best long-term interest of our shareholders is that <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> continue to operate as an independent company.'' <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s directors will make a recommendation on the tender offer by Oct. 31, <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> said, urging shareholders to hold onto their stock until then. The offer took the stock market by surprise. In consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Monday, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> stock rose 62 -LCB- cents a share to $ 60.12 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 1.37 -LCB- a share to $ 100. Trading volume in both stocks was roughly average. Complicating the takeover bid is a `` poison pill'' defense that <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> has erected to make unwanted takeovers difficult. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> to dismantle the shareholder rights plan and, to back its request, filed suit in federal district court in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> seeking to force <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> to drop the defense. Last year <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had $ 3.74 billion in operating profit on $ 25.41 billion in operating revenue. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> had a profit of $ 489 million on revenue of $ 9.88 billion. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said the companies would fit well together and would not face antitrust problems because they operate in different segments of the food industry. In a letter to <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> wrote: `` We respect and admire your organization, product line and commitment to quality.''

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, striving to regain the initiative in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, pledged today that during his first four years as president `` we'll turn that trade deficit back into a trade surplus.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reminded his audience at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> that Wednesday is the first anniversary of Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash. `` And remember why it happened?'' he asked. `` The trade deficit had soared. Republican policies of borrow and spend and borrow and spend had done the damage. `` Interest rates were going up to attract the foreign bankers we needed to buy our massive federal debt and the speculative bubble burst _ as it always does.'' Campaigning in the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was fighting to overcome the impression that Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was surging to an insurmountable lead and that their race was virtually over. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his top aides disputed a new national poll which said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a 17-point lead over the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. Campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> called reporters' attention to another poll published in the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> which showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trailing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by seven points. In his <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stressed the differences he perceived between the vice president and himself. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to help the people who already have it made,'' he said. `` I want to make every American a full shareholder in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream ... `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cares about the people on Easy Street. I care about the people on Main Street. He's on their side. I'm on your side.'' The Democratic nominee said that in the year since the stock market fell by 500 points, neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had done anything to correct the underlying causes. `` We've got to end the Republican rainbow coalition of red ink for our children, pink slips for our workers, greenmail for sharp operators on Wall Street and golden parachutes for top corporate executives,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that in its first four years, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` turned two generations of trade surpluses into the world's largest trade deficit _ and cost our workers 5 million jobs. `` In the first four years of the <LOCATION> Dukakis-Bentsen </LOCATION> administration we'll turn that trade deficit back into a trade surplus and reclaim those jobs for American workers,'' he said. `` That's our goal _ to eliminate the trade deficit in four years. It'll take hard work. We have to reduce the budget deficit. We'll do it.'' Monday night in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a predominantly black audience that the Democrats have just three weeks to 21 days to `` mobilize our forces ... to reach out to our neighborhoods'' before the Nov. 8 election showdown. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> learned of the new <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> survey giving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a 17-point lead, and said `` this business of polls is really having a terrible effect'' on the campaign. `` I can only tell you that there are other polls that say very different things about where we are and where the race is,'' the Democratic nominee said. Conceding that he is the underdog, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was campaigning in the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, telling voters that he would fight to create new jobs and describing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as indifferent to the region's problems <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` sat on his hands while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s industrial heartland has been fighting for its life.'' With only 21 days left in the long presidential campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up the pace of his activity. He was in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> all day Monday, touring a plant on the edge of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and then addressing workers; visiting a bowling alley in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> and meeting with local residents to discuss their problems with housing, education and drugs; then flying to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> for another community meeting and then a speech at a rally. At rallies, he implored supporters to get out and do the precinct work he hopes will result in an upset on Nov. 8. `` Those phone calls you make, the doors you knock on'' can make the difference he told them. There was obvious concern among <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his aides that his precinct workers will become discouraged by polls and by reports that he is trimming his efforts to the bare minimum of states that would provide the 270 electoral votes needed for election. Aides vehemently denied a report on Sunday that he was concentrating on 18 states with 272 electoral votes. But long gone was the memory of those days when national polls said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was 17 points ahead of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The new <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll said 55 percent of the 1,378 likely voters surveyed favored the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president and 38 percent backed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The survey also said that 36 percent had a favorable opinion of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, down from 50 percent a month ago, while 55 percent had a favorable opinion of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, up from 50 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s held a commanding lead among men, 64-30 percent, and a slight edge among women, 48-44 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the poll numbers had `` absolutely no relationship to anything that we have or other people have.'' He said polling `` really drives the process to a degree ... and everybody is doing them.''

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said today he is asking President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to shut down a federally owned uranium porcessing plant until the government takes steps to ensure it no longer threatens the environment with radioactive pollution. He said he is sending <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a letter today demanding that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the plant, provide for an independent evaluation of plant employees and area residents to assess the impact of its operation on their health. Referring to testimony last week about problems at the plant, <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said in the letter to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that `` This admission of deceit and mismanagement confirms and emphasizes what we have known in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> for a long time: This facility is an environmental disaster threatening the health and safety of thousands of Ohioans.'' Appearing at an airport news conference, <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> also demanded that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> treat and stabilize radioactive thorium to reduce the threat of fire that could spew the material into the atmosphere, and begin a final cleanup of radioactive waste stored in two deteroirating concrete silos. He also wants the department to start identifying the contents of 200,000 containers of waste that has accumulated as a result of what the governor said is the department's negligent management of the 1,050-acre site about 18 miles northwest of here in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> noted testimony Friday at a congressional committee hearing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which he said made it clear that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has known of dangerous environmental problems at the Feed Materials Production Center since the plant opened they said they are concerned about more than three decades of radioactive emissions into the atmosphere around the plant, and into thade progress at the plant with a decade-long cleanup costing more than $ 500 million. The plant processes uranium for the nation's production of nuclear weapons. Neighbors of the area around the plant fear that the plant already has polluted their land, water and air. In <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today met with two families who live near the plant and heard their concerns about the plant's safety.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Authorities foiled a military coup attempt, but several soldiers were wounded, officials said. The government said Monday it averted the planned coup Sunday by a group of army officers against Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, who came to power in a military takeover a month ago. Government spokesman <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON> said the plot against <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> was led by Sgt. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochard </PERSON>, who headed a government lottery, and former Col. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeremie </PERSON>, a convicted murderer who had escaped from prison. Radio <PERSON> Soliel </PERSON> said `` several soldiers were wounded'' and 30 were arrested in the attempted takeover. <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON> said some soldiers were arrested, but he gave no figure and said he could not confirm the radio report indicating there might have been shooting. `` Certain other officers have been discharged,'' <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON> said. `` They had maneuvered to stage a coup'' against <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. He said he had no further information. <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Roncery </PERSON>, a conservative politician, called <PERSON> Jeremie </PERSON> `` a pillar'' of the Duvalier dictatorship and said there could be `` an alliance in the works between the soldiers and the Tonton Macoutes.'' The Tonton Macoutes were tcceeded his father. The dictatorship ended when the younger <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1986 during anti-government violence. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> headed a three-man junta until general elections in January. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> staged a coup in June, ousted President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> and took power. A month ago, the 50-year-old <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> deposed <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and declared himself president. About 6,000 people demonstrated Monday near the National Palace to protest a directive by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> that would transfer the Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> out of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. Among the causes of last month's coup was an attack on <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s church in the capital. Men armed with guns, machetes and clubs burst into the church during Mass, killing 12 people, wounding 70 and setting the building on fire. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> was not injured. The Haitian priest said Oct. 10 that he was told by his superiors in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to leave <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and that they set Monday as the deadline for his departure. He did not elaborate, but a friend said <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> had been told to report to a parish in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. Another friend said <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> was still in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> is an advocate of liberation theology and has said the church must take an active role against social justices. Some church leaders have criticized <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> for his stand. Catholic-run Radio <PERSON> Soleil </PERSON> said the situation was too `` explosive'' for <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> to leave now and his transfer could create more unrest.

 Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said today that the Nov. 8 election will mark `` an American turning point'' that only a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration can navigate. `` Every one of these changes I have projected is going to happen,'' said the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator. `` The question is not whether they happen, but whether we will shape the world through them.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spoke at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> as he embarked on a day-long bus tour of downstate <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. He also crossed paths and spoke briefly with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was headed for campaign appearances in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> aides said the two discussed foreign policy and scheduling for a few months, and that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> expressed the hope they could campaign together sometime. Demonstrators favoring and opposing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s youthful running mate paraded noisily around the floor of the gymnasium where <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spoke. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> forces cheered lustily when police officers formed a line in front of anti-Quayle protesters. The day was described by campaign aides as full of `` controlled spontaneity,'' with plans for folksy, colorful stops at farms and schools as the bus caravan, nicknamed `` the <ORGANIZATION> Illini </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>,'' made its way toward <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on a cool and blustery fall day. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was joined by Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who himself was mentioned as a potential vice presidential running mate before the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> last August. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> toured <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> all day Monday, telling audiences that `` us Midwesterners have to stick together'' against `` that man from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' While lambasting Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> painted the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket as a perfectly balanced one. `` With <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, you get experience,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` With me you get the future, the future of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' That was a theme he returned to throughout a day of campaigning in increasingly soggy weather, and he expanded on it speaking with reporters on his campaign plane. `` Hopefully, I have a few years left, I'm only 41,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` That's something they -LRB- voters -RRB- will think about, but I do n't believe it will be a decisive factor. They vote for the top of the ticket.'' Most polls have shown the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket with a small but persistent lead in the polls, and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Republicans need to guard against overconfidence. `` We're not the least bit overconfident because there are still three weeks left in this campaign,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> wrapped up his campaign day Monday with outdoor events in a steady and cold drizzle, and tried to turn that to his advantage. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his favorite colors are gray and dark gray,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` What we're having today is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> weather.'' Along the way, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> shrugged off a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union to endorse <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> while at the same time pointedly declining to back the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> insisted the endorsement is `` good news for me'' because the union is again backing a Republican. `` I hope that all the Teamsters, people who follow their endorsement, rush out and vote,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` It's going to be important to have their votes. The fact is, I'm delighted they endorsed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Other than hitting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s focus of the day was economics. He said Republicans have solved a series of pressing economic woes, falling short only on budget deficits. `` We have, on every one of those issues, except for the budget deficit, solved them in a very positive manner,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` We will also meet the challenges of the budget deficit in the next administration.''

<TEXT>
 A federal panel recommended today that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> get serious about ensuring the health of its newborn citizens _ if for no better reason than to save money. Noting that more than $ 3 is saved for every dollar spent on prenatal care, the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> said government health officials _ federal and local _ should seek out pregnant women to make sure they get care they and their babies need early on rather than wait for frail and diseased infants to be born. The committee to study outreach for prenatal care referred to a 1985 institute study that calculated `` that each dollar spent on providing more adequate prenatal care to low-income, poorly educated women could reduce total expenditures for direct medical care of their low birthweight infants by $ 3.38 during the first year of life.'' <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON>, chairman of the committee, said at a news conference today that expanding Medicaid to cover all poor, pregnant women would cost an additional $ 875 million by 1993. `` But the most important fact is we would be saving $ 3 for every dollar spent, so what we really need to be doing is calculating the net savings,'' she said. Using that formula, the Medicaid expansion `` should result in net savings of $ 2.5 billion,'' she said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a committee member, said he is very optimistic that improvements will be made in prenatal care programs because `` if anything gets attention, it's dollars and cents.'' `` I just do n't think this nation is going to go on taking care of handicapped infants when we can prevent the handicaps with proper prenatal care,'' said <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON> is on the faculty of the school of public health at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> is an obstetrics and gynecology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> medical school in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. The survey said the health problems encountered by a significant portion of newborns includes `` a set of financial barriers ranging from problems in private insurance and Medicaid to the complete absence of health insurance.'' Among its recommendations, the committee called for the nation to `` adopt as a new social norm the principle that all pregnant women _ not only the affluent _ should be provided access to prenatal, labor and delivery, and postpartum services appropriate to their need.'' Recent federal legislation authorizes states to provide prenatal care under Medicaid for families whose income is up to 185 percent of the federal poverty line _ or more than $ 15,000 a year for a family of four. However, it is left to the states to decide whether to implement the option, which would result in a one-for-one match in federal dollars. Without referring to that new state option directly, the <ORGANIZATION> IOM </ORGANIZATION> survey said, `` Too often, communities organize outreach to help women over and around major obstacles to care rather than removing the obstacles themselves. To fund outreach in isolation and hope that it alone will accomplish major improvements in the use or prenatal services is naive and wasteful.'' The panel concluded that the solution is action rather than more study. `` The committee specifically urges that no more research be conducted to demonstrate the importance of financial and other institutional barriers to care,'' the report said. `` The committee ... recommends that the current practice of securing funds for services under the guise of research cease.'' It said the president, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other national leaders must `` commit themselves openly and unequivocally to designing a new maternity care system _ or systems _ dedicated to drawing all women into prenatal care and providing them with an appropriate array of health and social services throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period.''

 <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s lawyer hammered at the star witness against the former <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, pointing out inconsistencies in her testimony and getting her to admit that she had received electroshock treatments that may have affected her memory. The cross-examination of <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, the daughter of the judge <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> is charged with trying to bribe, began gently Monday with the defense lawyer drawing a picture of Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> as a brilliant college student. But the lawyer, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON>, soon had the witness visibly shaken, and she did not disagree when he told her that electroshock treatments `` made your memory selective, like a Swiss cheese with holes in it.'' Repeatedly, <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON> gave the jury examples of discrepancies that have appeared during the numerous times Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> has given testimony _ during an appearance before a grand jury, during depositions to the prosecution and during the trial. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, 64, her boyfriend <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, 43, and former state judge <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> are charged with a bribery conspiracy in which the younger Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> was given a city job in return for her mother's decision to slash <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s alimony and child-support payments in a divorce case before her. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> was the commissioner of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs. Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> was hired in 1983 as her $ 19,000-a-year special assistant. At one point during Monday's cross-examination in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court, Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> said she could not remember what she had told a reporter on Sunday or what she had testified during the previous week. `` My memory for events that took place in 1983 is better than for some events that took place yesterday,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> said, looking around the courtroom nervously. Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> said she always testified to the `` best of my recollection.'' Earlier Monday, under questioning by one of the prosecutors, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> testified that during the time a grand jury was investigating the alleged dealings in 1986, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> ordered her to keep quiet. `` What <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> said to me was, ` Listen, I'm worried. You know <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>'s been before a grand jury,''' she said. `` She said, ` We've got to get our stories straight. The trouble with you is you remember too much. You've got to learn to forget more. I've forgotten more than you'll ever know,''' Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> testified. However, under cross-examination, Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> admitted she was uncertain of the year she had had that alleged conversation with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> and also said that she had a series of 15 electroshock treatments, quite likely during one month in the spring of 1986. Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, who now takes antidepressant drugs, agreed with <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON> when he told the jury she had earlier testified that the shock treatments adversely affected her memory.

 A former member of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors said today that <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> deserved every bonus he received while at the helm of the television ministry and religious theme park. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, testifying in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 52 million lawsuit against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, and former top aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, said she and other board members consistently voted unanimously in favor of bonuses for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. `` If a bonus came up, I voted for it,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> figures presented in court today, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> received $ 278,000 in salary in the fiscal year ending in May 1987, plus $ 1,167,000 in bonuses. Under cross-examination, Ms. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> could not recall the precise salary of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> while she was on the board from November 1985 to March 1987. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was expected to testify later today. The trial began in bankruptcy court in September and was adjourned for about a month before resuming Monday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. In his opening statement Monday, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> told the court the case against the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> boiled down to allegations they mismanaged the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> television ministry, which went into bankruptcy three months after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in March 1987 amid a sex-and-money scandal. But <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said he would show that the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' salaries were authorized by the ministry's board, the benefits they enjoyed properly donated by the ministry, and the cash advances they were given reimbursed. Salaries and benefits received by the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founders, he said, were not only legal and properly approved but also earned. But because the ministry's records are now dispersed among other legal actions, including bankruptcy court, <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said he may be unable to provide precise documentation. `` A lot of the records are simply not available,'' he said. In a separate hearing Monday morning on <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy case, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said he wants to see how the proposed sale of the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry shapes up before considering whether to liquidate the troubled television ministry and its <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> postponed until Nov. 16 consideration of several motions by creditors to move the ministry from Chapter 11 bankruptcy to Chapter 7. If those motions are granted, it would mean <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and other ministry assets would be sold by an immediate auction rather than by an arranged sale. The judge said at a hearing last month he would hear the motions to convert to Chapter 7 if no buyer were found for <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. Canadian businessman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> has since signed a contract with <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M.C </ORGANIZATION>. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> to buy <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> for $ 115 million.

<TEXT>
 A 40-year-old man and his five sons were rescued after drifting helplessly in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> for more than a month, and he says he'd like to go back and retrieve their 33-foot sailboat. `` We put everything we had into that boat, sold everything, even our furniture, to buy it,'' said <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleishour </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, who along with his sons was rescued late Thursday by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tugboat. `` We've been on the water a lot. My older boys have experience sailing,'' <PERSON> Fleishour </PERSON> said. `` I'd like to go back and get it.'' But <PERSON> Fleishour </PERSON> said he knew the family's safety was more important than their boat. He said he had feared he would see his five sons die of starvation before they were rescued. <PERSON> Fleishour </PERSON> said he and his sons _ <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON>, 17; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 15; <PERSON> Kazan </PERSON>, 13; <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 11; and <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON>, 8 _ spent 33 days adrift in their sailboat Paloma before being rescued by the <ORGANIZATION> Narragansett </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tugboat operated by civilians, 550 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Thursday night. They survived eight days without food and five without water, he said. `` My estimation is the kids would have lasted _ with no water, no food _ approximately 10 days,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, second officer aboard the tugboat. `` In my opinion, the 8-year-old should have passed away.'' `` The youngest boy was not very responsive,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON>, who doubles as a medical officer. `` Two of the five kids were spitting up blood and had some form of a perforated ulcer.'' But none of the boys was hospitalized Sunday after they reached <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, where they stayed at a shelter, <PERSON> Fleishour </PERSON> said. `` The rescue was beautiful, like a dream,'' the father said. `` But the worst, the worst, was watching my kids starve to death right before my eyes, watching my little baby wander around that boat looking for something _ anything _ to eat.'' <PERSON> Fleishour </PERSON> said he and his family left <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> on Sept. 12 for what should have been about a two-week sail to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, bringing enough food and water _ 40 gallons _ to last 16 days. But the boat hit a squall and drifted for about 700 miles. They got the boat back on course, but its sails broke and rations ran low, he said. `` It got rough. A lot of times we lost hope, but I tried to be tough for the kids,'' <PERSON> Fleishour </PERSON> said. `` We caught five fish in 17 days and caught rainwater and licked the dew off in the morning.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spotted us Thursday night, but it was Friday before we were all on board,'' he said. `` They gave us soup and ham sandwiches. I do n't know how much longer we could have lasted.'' A construction worker who was born in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> but lived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for 31 years, <PERSON> Fleishour </PERSON> said he would stay in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and look for a job.

 Chinese forces killed eight Vietnamese while continuing their heavy shelling of Vietnamese territory in recent weeks, the official <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. Chinese troops armed with machine guns and rifles fired on a group of border guards who were making bricks in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chau </LOCATION> province bordering <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, it said. Four guards were killed and two wounded in the Oct. 10 attack, said the dispatch dated Monday and seen in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Tuesday. It said one border guard and three local militiamen were killed Sept. 15, when Chinese forces fired 300 mortar rounds into another border province, <LOCATION> Ha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tuyen </LOCATION>. Eleven others including six civilians were injured. The Chinese made 13 intrusions into Vietnamese territory from Sept. 15 to Oct. 16, and rained more than 4,000 artillery and mortar rounds on <PERSON> Vi </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuyen </PERSON> district of <LOCATION> Ha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tuyen </LOCATION>, the agency claimed. The communist adversaries have traded such accusations since they split after the Vietnam War and fought a frontier war in 1979.

 A weapons manufacturer Tuesday unveiled the first South African-made pistol, a result of the government's campaign to negate the effects of an international arms boycott. The 9mm pistol, called the Z88, was developed for the South African police by a subsidiary of the state arms corporation. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had been able to import pistols despite the arms embargo implemented by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1977, but officials said prices were excessive and delivery times often slow.

Since the embargo was imposed, the weapons industry has developed into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most lucrative manufacturing sector, despite attempts by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to discourage members from buying South African arms. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Defense Weekly, the respected British military publication, estimated that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> earned $ 900 million last year exporting arms to 23 countries.

<HEAD>Top U.S. Commander Says U.S. Gained Credibility in Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has gained unprecedented credibility with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders as a result of its large-scale naval commitment in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, according to the general who runs <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operations in the strategic waterway. `` This may be the first successful military application of a political objective that we've pulled off, perhaps, since <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' said Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>. The four-star <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> officer, who retires next month as commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command, said in an interview aboard the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s gulf flagship <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salle </LOCATION>: _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has its strongest-ever relations with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states, who originally expected <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to `` cut and run'' rather than become deeply involved in trying to stop Iranian military moves in the gulf. _ The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, whose effort to establish a presence in the gulf helped spur the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision, recently has bolstered its fleet and is `` not showing any signs of withdrawal.'' _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to reduce its naval force if the Aug. 20 Iraq-Iran cease-fire holds, but <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> will decide when to remove the Stars and Stripes from 11 oil tankers reflagged by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration 17 months ago as protection from Iranian attack. _ A major mine threat still exists and as allied navies pull out, `` the big question'' is who will wind up with the task of clearing them. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, 57, has been both diplomat and military officer during his three-year tenure at the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, Fla.-based Central Command, which began as a one-time `` ready reaction force'' and now administers <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military affairs in 19 countries. This encompasses the gulf, where danger to shipping from the eight-year Iraq-Iran war prompted last year's massive naval buildup by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and five <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said that commitment has enabled <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to establish better diplomatic ties and `` closer cooperation and coordination'' militarily with gulf <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments than ever before. `` We've moved mountains,'' he said. `` They were absolutely convinced we were going to cut and run. We did n't.'' He added, in a parting comment without elaboration: `` It was a near thing, though.'' Most Arab states are cool toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of its pro-Israel stance, and rarely praise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. But <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has managed to win new friends in the gulf. `` They do n't want the Russians in. They like the Americans. We're not colonial, we're not overbearing,'' he said. In working with Americans, he added, `` they've gained a lot more confidence in their own capabilities that they did n't have before.'' Although refusing to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases on their territory, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> quietly have provided limited support facilities for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said he could not have done without. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said the mine threat is serious in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gulf </LOCATION>, where both belligerents sowed mines. Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers have said there may be as many as 200 left. Six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mine sweepers were `` probably the last capability'' he would remove, <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said. Some European navies already are withdrawing theirs, and it's unclear whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will wind up with the mine-clearing task, he said. That decision may fall to <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Gen. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON>, scheduled to succeed <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> at Central Command on Nov. 23. When the reflagged convoys began, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s gulf-based <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> included only the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salle </LOCATION> and four combatants. As the `` tanker war'' escalated, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regional fleet grew to as many as 40 ships. There currently are 26, including 10 in the gulf. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would `` ratchet this thing down'' to around the original level as circumstances permit, but will never leave the gulf entirely. `` We've been here since 1949, and as long as the Russians stay around, I do n't think we're going to turn the keys to the storeroom over,'' he said. He said the Soviets keep seven to nine ships in the area and `` are not showing any signs of withdrawal.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> recently deployed the 11,000-ton hospital ship Ob, fitted as a floating rest center for <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> sailors, he said. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recently ended close escort of the Kuwaiti tankers, <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said the ships will have `` traditional protection'' as long as <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> complies with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> maritime and tax laws.

<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts from the citation by the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> awarding the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science to <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>: One of the principal tasks of basic research in economics is to formulate a rigorous model of equilibrium in markets and examine the efficiency of this equilibrium. The problem dates back to <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and his theory of the `` invisible hand'' which coordinates a _ to all appearances _ chaotic structure comprised of a multitude of independent and individual decisions based on self-interest. Paradoxically, this chaos gives rise to coordinated equilibria based on market prices. Firms' production decisions will correspond to consumers' planned consumption ... The foremost contribution of <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> was made in the 1940s when he continued to develop <PERSON> Walras </PERSON>' and <PERSON> Pareto </PERSON>'s work by providing increasingly rigorous mathematical formulations of market equilibrium and the efficiency properties of markets. On the basis of mathematical models of households' and firms' planning and choice, he introduced a very general formulation of the conditions for market equilibrium ... <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>' outstanding achievements may be characterized as basic research in economics. By his links to an older French tradition in economic research, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> is the most prominent figure in modern economic research in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> as regards basic theory and applications to public-sector planning. Even though his fundamental research has been relatively little known beyond the French-speaking sphere, <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> has had a far-reaching indirect impact through younger French economists who have been strongly influenced by his work ... The sum of <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>' productive achievements in economic theory is considerable. Moreover, he has carried out various applied studies in e.g. operations research and has participated extensively in debates in the French press. Alongside his accomplishments as an economist, <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> has published studies in history and physics, particularly geophysics.

 The disappearances and mutilations of up to 30 cats have distressed residents in a city neighborhood, but police suspect that `` crazy kids'' rather than a cult are responsible. `` It really has bothered us,'' said <PERSON> Vicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusk </PERSON>. `` We do n't want children finding mutilated animals.'' Twenty-five to 30 cats have disappeared since late spring, said <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusk </PERSON>, one of about 300 residents of the <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> neighborhood who attended a special town meeting Monday night. `` My cat has been missing since July and my sister has one missing.'' Police department Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said 12 cat carcasses have been found. Parts of dismembered cats appear to have been left in places where they will be spotted easily, Mrs. <PERSON> Lusk </PERSON> said. Residents are `` finding parts of them on open land, in the park, on the golf course,'' she said. `` It definitely is not a coyote or other animal ... the heads have been cut off or they have been cut in half,'' she said. `` Somebody has been doing this.'' <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>, said she has received several calls from pet owners in <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> who reported their cats missing. Her organization has posted a $ 500 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible, she said. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Police Det. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smart </PERSON> told the residents at the meeting there was no evidence to link the disappearances and dismemberings to any cult or to suggest that the culprits could attack people. `` We have n't seen ... -LRB- or -RRB- heard of children being approached,'' <PERSON> Smart </PERSON> said. But Mrs. <PERSON> Lusk </PERSON> remained unconvinced. `` We ca n't prove any rituals are involved,'' she said. `` Everybody knows there are cults that do use cats. The parts of the bodies have been placed in different ways. They were n't just thrown out of a car.'' Police spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said authorities `` did n't know about it until about three this afternoon.'' `` It happening in the warm months makes me think it's a bunch of crazy kids going around doing some weird stuff,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON>, who landed his small plane on Red Square last year, wants to return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, `` but this time with a ticket,'' a Soviet official said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> made it clear, however, that the West German will find the welcome in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> no warmer than it was the first time around, when he was sentenced to four years in prison for malicious hooliganism, violating international flight rules and illegally entering the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Rust was freed in August by a special act of the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, and expelled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after more than a year in prison. But <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> noted the criminal case remains, `` and he can expect some difficulties if he wants to come back.''

He was driven directly from the prison to <LOCATION> Sheremetyevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> when he was expelled. The young pilot evaded Soviet air defenses before buzzing the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and landing on before a startled crowd on Red Square on May 28, 1987. The flight also prompted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to fire its defense minister and the air defense chief, and to treat Rust as a criminal rather than the peace advocate he claimed to be at his trial.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has agreed to the exchange of prisoners of war taken in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, but maintains the move is not related to its peace talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, according to a document released today. <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter to Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will begin the POW exchange if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reciprocates. In the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> letter to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, dated Monday, <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> separated the move to release prisoners from the talks over <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan to end the 8-year war. `` Since the exchange of prisoners is a humanitarian matter'' in response to a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> request, `` our agreement on this step is unrelated to the other issues referred to in'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan. Security Council Resolution 598 called for an immediate cease-fire, withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized boundries and the exchange of prisoners. The two nations accepted a U.N.-mediated cease-fire that began Aug. 20, but peace talks have been deadlocked since just after they began Aug. 25. <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON>'s letter said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to begin registering all prisoners of war who are not yet on official POW lists, and asked for detailed medical examinations of all POWs in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Each nation is to receive a copy of each POW's medical report before their exchange, <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> said. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has 50,182 prisoners and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> 19,284 prisoners. But <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials and diplomats in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> believe <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has 60,000-70 ,000 prisoners and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> 30,000-50 ,000 In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, a senior <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> official today rejected a condition offered by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for a permanent settlement of the war. Foreign Undersecretary <PERSON> Nizzar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdoun </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was setting unacceptable conditions by insisting that both countries maintain a 1975 treaty setting the border in the middle of the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the treaty, which draws the border in the middle of the waterway instead of along the Iranian shoreline, is no longer valid. `` The Iranian position ... is an attempt to pressurize <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to relinquish its political and legal rights while the two sides are discussing purely technical issues,'' <PERSON> Hamdoun </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali-Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, said Monday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan but only on condition that the 1975 treaty is upheld. Peace talks stalled over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistance the waterway be cleared of silt and ships that were sunk early in the war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had rejected the demand saying it was a secondary issue that could be settled later. Both sides have blamed each other for the stalemate in negotiations, which resume next week in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today Republican policies caused last year's stock market plunge, and he promised big economic changes to avoid another. Rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared the Iron Curtain `` a rusting curtain'' but said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vigilence is still necessary. Both men said the presidential race is not over, despite a new poll showing a big <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead with just three weeks till Election Day. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in remarks prepared for delivery in <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> 46 years ago used the term `` Iron Curtain'' in a speech, said: `` The iron curtain still stretches from <LOCATION> Stettin </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Trieste </LOCATION>. But it's a rusting curtain.'' `` The Soviets are restrained by their own troubles, But they are also restrained by our strength, our ability to deter aggression, the unity of the democracies,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined to celebrate his lead in public opinion surveys, saying, `` There are undecided voters out there. The race is close in many states. No votes can be taken for granted and I'm not taking any votes for granted. I will continue to campaign as an underdog.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, speaking in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, to a <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> audience, said, `` We've got to end the Republican rainbow coalition of red ink for our children, pink slips for our workers, greenmail for sharp operators on Wall Street and golden parachutes for top corporate executives.'' Turning to the stock market drop, which occurred one year ago Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` And remember why it happened? The trade deficit had soared; Republican policies of borrow and spend and borrow and spend had done the damage. `` Interest rates were going up to attract the foreign bankers we needed to buy our massive federal debt and the speculative bubble burst _ as it always does.'' He pledged that during the first four years of a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration, `` we'll turn that trade deficit back into a trade surplus.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent much of Monday trying to reinvigorate his campaign, even as a new poll showed him falling farther behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The Democrat also took a swipe at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during a rally with black voters in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, saying, `` Something is very wrong when a presidential candidate calls <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> a hero and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a hustler.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself, in an interview today on `` CBS This Morning,'' disputed any suggestion that he has not worked hard enough for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the man who beat him for the Democratic nomination at the party's <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention in July. `` The fact is, since <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> I've traveled more miles, spoken to more people and registered more voters for this ticket than any Democrat has,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has the support of black voters and can beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if other Democrats work as hard for the ticket as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used a tour of a <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> defense plant in <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, on Monday to talk of a military role in securing world peace and to ridicule <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' defense stand. The vice president is not letting up on his attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> despite a 17-point lead in the latest nationwide poll. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is releasing three new television ads today, including one incorporating news footage of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> driving a tank, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has saved more than half of its $ 30 million advertising budget and will target the airwaves in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The newspaper said the information was based on an internal campaign document obtained by the Post. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign had no comment on the report, said Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. Another Bush ad, which aired this past weekend, suggests that only the vice president is experienced enough to negotiate with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` This is no time to train somebody in how to meet with the Russians,'' the commercial says. `` This is the time for strength and experience. This is the time for somebody who's ready on Day One to be president.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said today at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, at the beginning of a bus tour of small and medium-size <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> towns, that this year's election marks `` an American turning point'' that only the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> can properly handle. Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the biggest <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> prize with 47 votes. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Monday, invoked the image of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s come-from-behind victory in decrying <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> distortions of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record. `` It was <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> who said that you have to appeal to the best instincts of people, not to their worst,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` Sometimes you can win a few elections that way, but you really hurt your country.'' Meanwhile, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 55-38 percent, among 1,378 likely voters surveyed Friday through Sunday. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. Almost three-quarters of those polled said they expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to win the election, including half of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' own supporters. But the Democratic nominee and his running mate disputed the survey's results. `` This business of polls is really having a terrible effect,'' on the process, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I can only tell you that there are other polls that say very different things about where we are and where the race is.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he did n't believe the poll was accurate, and said, `` You see wide fluctuations among those polls. That's what's happening. For his part, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said only, `` Run like you're 17 points behind.''

 Americans are increasingly reluctant to tolerate landfills near their homes but have n't really faced the problem of what to do about all that garbage, according to a poll commissioned by waste-handling companies. The poll results, released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, were taken from telephone interviews with 1,500 randomly selected adults in February, telephone interviews with 500 `` opinion leaders'' in March and face-to-face interviews with another 1,500 people in July and August. The February survey found that 30 percent of respondents would favor building new landfills in their communities to handle garbage and trash, while 62 percent were opposed. The remainder were undecided. Opposition was about the same _ 65 percent, in the summer poll, but those in favor had dropped to 20 percent. <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserstrom </PERSON>, public affairs director of the association, said that even if half the nation's garbage were recycled in five years, `` the remaining garbage would exceed our landfill capacity'' without new landfills or incincerators. The July-August survey found that 33 percent favored state or federal boards that could override local opposition to new facilities, and 46 percent opposed. `` I was surprised'' that support was as high as a third, <PERSON> Wasserstrom </PERSON> said. Among opinion leaders, 57 percent favored such boards and 40 percent opposed. When incinerators that can sell energy to hold down costs are matched against landfills, incinerators win _ but people still do n't want incinerators, according to the poll. Forty-seven percent of the sample opposed such `` waste-to-energy'' plants in the community, and 36 percent were in favor. `` People's attitudes about garbage disposal are highly contradictory,'' <PERSON> Wasserstrom </PERSON> said. `` A large majority of the population would like to believe recycling is the answer.'' Yet many respondents `` correctly indentified 25 to 50 percent as a realistic range'' that could be recycled. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON>, director of resource recovery programs for the association, said he had discovered a `` NIMEY'' _ `` Not in my election year'' _ to go along with the well-known `` NIMBY'' response _ `` Not in my back yard.'' `` What we need in this country is the political will to deal with these problems,'' <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> said. Seventy percent of the February sample and 84 percent of the summer group said recycling could `` solve much of the solid waste disposal problem.'' When those polled were asked how much could be recycled, the median answer was 44 percent _ half named a percentage above 44 percent and half named one below. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that 10 percent of the annual stream of 230 million tons of garbage and trash is recycled currently, with another 5 percent incinerated. The agency hopes to cajole and persuade state and local governments into making that 25 percent in 1992. The waste association represents 2,500 companies that handle half the nation's household waste and 95 percent of its industrial waste. It has conducted polls on garbage questions for several years. For a poll of 1,500 people, the margin of error is about 3 percentage points either way; for a poll of 500, the margin is a little less than 4.5 points.

<HEAD>No Fifth Superpower Summit, Fitzwater Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman on Tuesday dismissed speculation of a fifth superpower summit in the waning days of the administration, saying the idea is `` completely ruled out.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the White House generally hesitates to make flat statements about future plans, but in the case of another summit, `` We have to say no possiblity.'' No plans are under way for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to meet with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> before the president quits office in mid-January, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Yes, I think it is completely ruled out,'' he said in response to a reporter's question. The superpower leaders have held four summit since they first met in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, in November 1985. Other summits were conducted in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> in October 1986, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December 1987 and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last May. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the two men signed a treaty eliminating their countries' intermediate-range nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said that comments made over the weekend by Deputy <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> were `` totally consistent'' with the administration's views on what is happening inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, in speeches Friday and Saturday, gave a gloomy assessment of current events in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has stepped up its spying activities against Americans since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power. He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms have not brought about economic improvements and, `` I would even say it is doubtful that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can rejuvenate the Soviet system.'' Moreover, the Soviet system is threatened by ethnic disturbances, he said. While the administration might not agree with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> on every point, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>' comments `` quite correctly point out the things that we need to be very concerned about in dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> have pointed out that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to see the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reduce its defense budget to underscore a commitment to world peace. `` We feel we do have better relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the president has good relations with Secretary General <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` But the system is the same, the country is the same and the threat is the same and we need to be quite aware of that,'' he said.

 Two construction workers, left dangling 140 feet above a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> street when their scaffolding collapsed, were rescued unharmed Tuesday after 45 minutes in midair, the Fire Department said. The men were working on a building at the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia-Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> when a motor on the scaffold gave out, dumping both men from the platform on the 15th floor, said Fire Chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Loghran </PERSON>. `` When we arrived, the scaffold was hanging straight down and the workers were about 140 feet above the ground,'' said <PERSON> Loghran </PERSON>. The men were both suspended from safety ropes attached to the top of the building, he said. Firefighters moved a construction shed to allow a 100-foot rescue ladder in at the workers, <PERSON> Loghran </PERSON> said. Because the building is on a slope, the 100-foot ladder was able to reach the men, <PERSON> Loghran </PERSON> said. Firefighters loaded the men into the ladder bucket and brought them down uninjured, said <PERSON> Loghran </PERSON>.

 Plagued by high winds in the <LOCATION> Shinnecock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION>, officials on Tuesday postponed plans to tow a stranded whale from <LOCATION> Peconic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to the open ocean. They said they may try Thursday.

He said the whale is emaciated from lack of food and disoriented, but is behaving normally. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, an administrative assistant at the foundation, said winds in the inlet forced researchers to cancel the towing attempt and will likely force a postponement until Thursday. When conditions improve, divers from the foundation will attach a rope to the whale's tail and then put the animal in a harness and remove the tail rope, according to <PERSON> Sadove </PERSON>. The whale will then be attached to two <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boats and towed into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The whale was first discovered by boaters in <LOCATION> Sag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> two weeks ago, and then moved into shallow waters of peconic bay. <PERSON> Sadove </PERSON> says the whale is 17 feet long and weighs five tons. This is the first whale sighted in <LOCATION> Peconic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Okeanos </ORGANIZATION>'s records, which go back to 1880

<HEAD>Report: City Economy Survived Crash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The city's economy fared much better than expected in the year after last October's stock market crash, according to a report released Tuesday by state Comptroller <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. `` While the securities industry clearly was hurt by the crash, the impact has been far less severe than originally forecast,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. `` Furthermore, the rest of the city's economy has been little affected.'' The report predicted that the city will gain 35,000 jobs this year, despite post-crash predictions of job losses ranging from 10,000 to 47,000. The projected 1988 loss of 7,000 security industry jobs will be more than offset by an increase of 30,000 service jobs, according to the report. Even businesses closely tied to finance, such as law and printing, have shrugged off the impact of the crash. The report listed these signs of economic vitality: _ The city unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent in the second quarter of the year, the lowest since 1970 _ The `` gross city product,'' a measure of economic output, posted its strongest annual growth in 20 years: 3.4 percent for the 12 months ending with June _ Retail sales and tourism are up, and the welfare caseload is down But the report warns that the city faces problems. The securities industry could lose an another 7,000 jobs next year, and there also may be a slowdown in employment in the real estate and banking industries. The report also noted that the 35,000-job increase for 1988 is smaller than the figure for each of the four previous years, and that many of those still employed in the security industry have taken pay cuts.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking where <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> gave his famed `` iron curtain'' speech 42 years ago, declared today the barriers surrounding the Soviet bloc are rusting but that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must still stand tough against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invoked the British statesman's memory in remarks prepared for delivery at <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> popularized the phrase `` iron curtain'' in 1946 to describe the barrier of self-imposed isolation and secrecy that enclosed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after World War II. Noting his widening lead over Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in pre-election polls, the Republican nominee said both <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> knew that `` no election was over until it was really over. ` `` There are undecided voters out there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` The race is close in many states. No votes can be taken for granted, and I'm not taking any votes for granted I will continue to campaign as an underdog.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not include any attack or mention of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in his speech today, which quoted at length from Churchill's speech at <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION>. `` The iron curtain still stretches from <LOCATION> Stettin </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Trieste </LOCATION>. But it's a rusting curtain,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president said `` there is a new hope of change'' in Eastern bloc countries, but it would be wrong to conclude that the Soviets were deterred from aggression by their preoccupation with economic troubles. `` The Soviets are restrained by their own troubles, But they are also restrained by our strength, our ability to deter aggression, the unity of the democracies,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strength made possible the signing last year of the treaty calling for destruction of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet medium-range nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said similar reductions aimed at balancing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet convention arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` will be a high priority for me.'' On Monday in <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, the vice president stumped for Jewish votes in the heavily Jewish suburb of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that was wrenched a decade ago by a battle over a neo-Nazi march. Speaking in a driving rain at an outdoor memorial to Holocaust victims, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews in world War II was `` an evil far more vast than any in human history.'' But he said the memorial offers `` hope for the persistence of Jewish dreams and for the promise of Jewish lives yet unlived.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later had time to comment on his surge in the polls, including a new <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll showing him ahead of his Democratic opponent by 55 percent to 38 percent. `` We have three weeks to go from this very minute,'' he told a rally at the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Page </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellyn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` And I am running as if I were 10 points behind. I'm not going to let up.'' In <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, where he spent the night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` Run like you're 17 points behind.'' Today <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was traveling to <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, for a foreign policy speech. <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> is where the late <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> introduced the phrase `` iron curtain'' to refer to the Soviet bloc countries in 1946. Continuing attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as weak on foreign affairs and defense, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign was planning to air a new ad using footage from a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign appearance that backfired on the Democrat: his test ride in a tank. An ad that was released over the weekend suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be best able to deal with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` This is no time to train somebody in how to meet with the Russians,'' the ad says. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> had no information on a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> report today that the campaign was tentatively planning to spend more than $ 15 million of its $ 30 million-plus advertising budget in three states. The three states are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. While in <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention the turmoil that occurred 10 years ago when a neo-Nazi group planned a march in the community. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> successfully fought efforts by the community to block the march, but the white supremacists decided to hold it in a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> park instead. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign gave reporters no chance to get close enough to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to ask him his views on that case or the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> involvement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been relentless in attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, a group <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faults for far-left positions. Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said that in a longer speech that was cut short because of the rain, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had intended to mention the controversy, in which he agreed with the <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION> government. But she said he had not intended to mention the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. In remarks pared down to just a few minutes, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` committed to the survival of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' `` We must keep that strategic partnership, and then we must maintain that deterrent that comes of military and diplomatic resolve,'' he said. In his earlier defense speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged to reform the Pentagon procurement system to cut waste.

 Three escaped anti-apartheid activists holed up in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate for five weeks plan to `` call the state's bluff'' and emerge from their refuge Wednesday. The activists disclosed their decision Tuesday after advice was relayed to them from jailed black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The three previously had said they mistrusted the government's pledge to let them leave the consulate without being redetained. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, said Monday she discussed the activists when she met Saturday with her husband, who is recovering from tuberculosis at a hospital in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> said she passed on unspecified suggestions from her husband to the escapees' lawyers The three activists _ prominent leaders of banned opposition groups _ have been living in a meeting room at the consulate on the 11th floor of a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> office building since their escape Sept. 13. The government has said the men are free to leave and will not be detained again or restricted. `` The three have called the state's bluff and intend to leave ... to claim their freedom,'' said a statement issued on their behalf by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the largest anti-apartheid group not banned from functioning. The activists' decision `` is a major test of the government's undertaking and will once again bring the spotlight on the detention and persecution of anti-apartheid activists,'' said the congress, the main black labor federation The three activists are <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, senior leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Vusi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khanyile </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. All had been held more than a year without charge when they slipped away from guards while undergoing physiotherapy at a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> hospital. <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Khanyile </PERSON> are black, <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> is Indian. `` If the state detains or restricts them, it will deepen the credibility problems of the apartheid regime,'' the congress' statement said `` Government repression has not, and will not, succeed in destroying the strength and mass support of the democratic movement.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they would not force the three to leave despite a policy of not allowing diplomatic premises to be used by asylum seekers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have maintained a low profile during the episode and the embassy issued no statement Tuesday. The South African government also had no immediate comment. An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for varying periods during the 28-month-old state of emergency. About 1,000 people are in detention, according to anti-apartheid groups. The three escapees have demanded the release of all detainees and protesting the policy of indefinite detention without trial, which they described as a form of torture. Colleagues of the three criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials for barring the men from direct contact with the news media. An activist who escaped to the consulate Sept. 21, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON>, left the refuge earlier to obtain medical treatment. His lawyers had allege he was tortured while in custody.

<TEXT>
 Three prominent American Jewish groups are charging that hard-line lobbying for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is out of step with `` the consensus of the organized Jewish community.'' The attack on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, an influential <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbying group, surfaced in a letter published Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and verified as accurate. A senior official of the committee told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> `` this whole episode is bound to confuse members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The committee is the principal pro-Israel lobbying group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and concentrates its efforts on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The attack came from leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. They disagreed in the letter with <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s opposition to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile sale to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, an oil-rich Arab country; the lobbying group's attempt to force the closing of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>; and the committee's campaign to deny a visa to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in the event he tried to appear before the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> An <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where the group was holding a board meeting Tuesday, said `` more consultation is always desirable'' among Jewish groups. He said leaders of the committee would meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with the critics on Nov. 3. The Kuwaiti arms sale was modified but was not blocked by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, agreeing with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, ruled the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office should stay open despite a congressional vote to close it. So far, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has not indicated he wanted to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> is one of the most effective lobbying groups in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and organizes support for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members it finds friendly to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The committee has nurtured <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the strategic cooperation agreement with the Jewish state. At the same time, the committee has played a leading role in persuading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to block or trim a number of arms sales to Arab countries not at peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The letter called for closer consultation with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Defamation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which already are represented on <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee The letter said in part: `` We believe such consultation and coordination will help avoid situations in which <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> pursues policies that are at variance with the consensus of the organized Jewish community, as occurred most recently with respect to the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> arms deal and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and threatens to occur again with respect to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s possible forthcoming visit to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.''

<HEAD>Peyote Use OK in Indian Ceremonies, Oregon High Court Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The use of the hallucinogenic drug peyote in Indian religious ceremonies is protected by the federal constitution's guarantee of religious freedom, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. The decision involves two former <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> drug counselors who were fired and denied jobless benefits for using peyote during Native American Church religious ceremonies. In today's ruling, the high court expanded its 1986 decision in which it said denying jobless benefits to the two men violated their constitutional rights to freely practice their religion. The state had appealed the earlier ruling to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which sent it back to the state court for a definitive ruling on whether peyote could be legally used in religious ceremonies in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> under state criminal law. Peyote is a cactus that contains mescaline, a hallucinogenic drug that's illegal in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Possession of the drug is a felony. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, in oral arguments before the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, said the state has constitutional authority to impose a ban on all uses of peyote. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> also argued that to permit religious use of that drug would open the door to all kinds of religious drug exemptions to be claimed in criminal trials. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in today's decision, noted that <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> laws against the possession of controlled substances, including peyote, `` make no exception for the sacramental use of peyote.'' At the same time, the court said that the `` outright prohibition of good faith religious use of peyote by adult members of the <ORGANIZATION> Native </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> would violate the First Amendment directly and as interpreted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The ruling involved <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Galen </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who were fired from their jobs with the Roseburg-based <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> and Treatment for using peyote at religious ceremonies. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Black </PERSON> were denied unemployment benefits on grounds that they lost their jobs because of misconduct. The council's rules forbid the use of alcohol or illegal drugs <PERSON> Sueanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovendahl </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Roseburg </LOCATION> lawyer representing the two men, argued that the use of peyote in the Indian church is tightly controlled and that its use outside the church is a sacrilege.

<HEAD>Giant Shrimp Found In Waters From S.C. To Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists and shrimpers are closely watching to see how some giant shrimp that escaped from a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> research facility will affect the native crop. The shrimp, scientifically called the Penaeus monodon but carrying nicknames such as the giant tiger, have been found in commercial nets from <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augustine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` This will be very interesting to watch,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobkin </PERSON>, a professor of biological sciences at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` But certainly it is not desirable for exotics to be loosed on nature, even though this is a nice shrimp.'' The exotic shrimp, native to the waters of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and southeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, weigh up to one-quarter pound each and reportedly taste good. But some shrimpers are concerned that they might eat native shrimp and carry contagious diseses. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>, a commercial shrimper who manages the <ORGANIZATION> Bryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisherman </ORGANIZATION>'s Coop on the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> coast, said boats docking at his facility have landed about 15 of the giant tigers since August. <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> said he notified researchers with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> because he wanted more information about the alien shrimp. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Waddell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mariculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bluffton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, from which the shrimp escaped, said the giant tigers were certified disease-free by the Hawaiian hatchery that supplied them. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, a biologist with the Marine Extension Center who began documenting catches and doing research on the giant tigers in August, said the imported shrimp are not as inclined to eat their own kind as native white shrimp. Manager <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON> center imported more than 700,000 quarter-inch tiger shrimp this spring and used them to stock three artificial ponds on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast, including a pond at the <LOCATION> Bluffton </LOCATION> facility, where researchers conduct mariculture experiments. Although the center and private mariculture operations have successfully raised imported <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> ocean shrimp in their ponds in past years, this was the first year any of the giant tiger shrimp were brought to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast, he said. At the <LOCATION> Bluffton </LOCATION> center, fine-mesh screens were installed in the floodgates of dikes surrounding the pond to prevent the shrimp from migrating to tidal waters, <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said. `` But the shrimp apparently went around the screens,'' he said. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said he has no idea how many of the 100,000 shrimp initially stocked in the center's pond found their way to open waters. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> first realized that some of the giant shrimp had escaped when a few showed up in a drainage canal leading from the pond to a tidal waterway, he said. `` Then we got a call in late July from a shrimp boat captain who said he had an odd-looking shrimp,'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Voters in Washington State To Decide Rival Toxic Waste Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAL SPENCER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Environmentalists are dueling with business and the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state over rival ballot measures that each side claims is the best way to clean up toxic waste sites. Environmental groups back Initiative 97 which would give the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> unilateral authority to order a site cleaned up, impose stiff fines and pursue criminal sanctions against polluters who balked. But rival ballot measure 97B, backed by the business community and most state legislators, would allow polluters time to negotiate a clean-up plan. Supporters say 97B's strength is it permits the state and industry to clean up sites together, with industry bearing most of the expense. If 97B passes, it will affirm a toxic waste cleanup statute enacted a year ago. Initiative 97 would raise an estimated $ 63.4 million to $ 68 million through a seven-tenths of 1 percent tax on toxic substances, including gasoline and other refined oil products. Measure 97B would raise an estimated $ 51 million to $ 56 million by means of a eight-tenths of 1 percent tax on hazardous substances. This tax also would apply to refined oil products, but unlike Initiative 97, would exempt refined products exported to other states. The bulk of revenues generated by either measure would go towards pay overhead, administration and enforcement of the law, state officials said. Backers of each measure, which will be on Nov. 8 ballots, claim that theirs is tougher on polluters. `` The 97B proposal creates a set of bureaucratic hoops through which liable persons can make DOE jump before it can get a site cleaned up,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a Boston-based specialist on toxic waste clean-up laws. `` No other state -LRB- with toxic waste clean-up laws -RRB- has such a convoluted response as that of the 97B proposal.'' But supporters of 97B argue that the law's cooperative approach is its strength and the reason that, ultimately, it is tougher than 97. Sen. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreidler </PERSON>, D-Olympia, who helped draft the measure before it became law at a special legislative session a year ago, said 97B envisions that polluters themselves will pay more than 70 percent of negotiated clean-up costs, while only a small part of the cost will come from the law's special tax on possessors of hazardous substances. Initiative 97, meanwhile, would rely on a similar tax as its primary source of clean-up funding, <PERSON> Kreidler </PERSON> contended, even though expected revenues would not begin to cover the estimated $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion needed to cleanse as many as 400 waste sites in the state. Initiative 97, <PERSON> Kreidler </PERSON> said, assumes that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> will `` use the -LRB- tax -RRB- fund for clean up, and then litigate to recover the costs.'' He said litigation to recover the balance would mean costly delays at best and possibly no money at the end. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON>, a main spokesman for the Initiative 97 campaign and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, countered that Initiative 97 `` also relies heavily on voluntary clean-ups. It is just that ours has a significant stick attached to it to ensure that responsible parties step forward to clean up the sites without forcing the state to go to court.'' Supporters of 97B, led by aerospace, oil and timber interests, have raised $ 800,000 for their highly visible campaign featuring billboards, mass mailings and TV advertising. Initiative 97 backers, meanwhile, have raised only $ 196,000, and campaigners acknowledge that 97B's greater financial resources put their initiative at a disadvantage. Despite the heated debate, some here believe that either measure would leave the state with a sound toxic waste policy. `` We are not at a crossroads in state environmental policy,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Goltz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> lawyer and former head of the state Ecology Division of the attorney general's office. `` What is left for voters to decide this November are relatively minimal modifications of the approach the legislature already adopted,'' he said. `` Either the initiative or the alternative would establish a sound, pro-environment toxic waste policy for the state, without undue burden on industry.''

 An emaciated five-ton whale was stuck in a shallow bay off <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> today, and adverse weather forced conservationists to postpone plans to pull the 17-foot mammal into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and foundation researchers had hoped to harness the whale to two boats today and tow it through <LOCATION> Shinnecock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shinnecock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, an administrative assistant at the foundation, said winds in the inlet forced researchers to cancel the towing attempt for today and will likely force a postponement until Thursday. Earlier plans to rescue the animal were suspended Monday when whale-watchers said they had n't seen the mammal since dusk Sunday night and there was no signal from a radio transmitter that was placed on it Saturday, <PERSON> Sadove </PERSON> said. But a plane sent up by the foundation sighted the whale around 3:30 p.m. Monday, he said. The whale was discovered by boaters in <LOCATION> Sag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> two weeks ago and moved into the shallow waters of <LOCATION> Peconic </LOCATION> last week. This is the first whale sighted in the bay, according to <ORGANIZATION> Okeanos </ORGANIZATION>' records, which go back to 1880. About the time the whale was spotted in <LOCATION> Sag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, three <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales became trapped near <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> hopes to launch major new economic initiatives in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to cash in on ambitious plans to overhaul its economy, officials said Tuesday. A $ 1.6 billion West German credit to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> signed this week has buoyed optimism among businesses in this staunch <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ally. `` We believe that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can play a leading role in making modernization possible in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Reinhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Krause </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has long enjoyed good economic relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and remains its biggest Western trading partner despite declines in recent years. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms have fueled interest in establishing closer economic and political ties, <PERSON> Krause </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Officials in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> see broadening opportunities for more joint ventures and for increased West German participation in the consumer and supply sectors. West German firms are involved in 13 joint ventures in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and 35 more are under negotiation. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is clearly interested in quickly improving the quality of consumer services to its citizens,'' Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said. `` This is a political opportunity that could lead to many new contracts with West German firms,'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said after meeting with industrialists in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The West German enthusiasm in the economic sphere is matched by a growing positive public perception of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his reforms. According to a poll released by the Munich-based <ORGANIZATION> Sinus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, 84 percent of West Germans think positively about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, 41 percent said they like the Soviets, and 51 percent judged his reforms positively. Important groundwork for expanding West German trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was laid Monday with the signing of the $ 1.6 billion credit agreement, the biggest foreign credit ever extended by West German banks. <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, which heads the consortium of banks, signed the agreement with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. The credit line was set up to finance West German exports primarily in the food, leather, textile and clothing sectors. West German economic officials hope to expand well beyond those areas. An <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> report said that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> holds the potential for a `` wide field of economic cooperation and export opportunities'' in the areas of agriculture, energy, environmental techonology, medical equipment and light and heavy machinery. The report said the Soviets have drawn up a list of German firms they are interested in dealing with. `` There is enormous potential here,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietsch </PERSON>, a finance and trade expert at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commerzbank </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has tremendous market potential for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other Western nations,'' <PERSON> Pietsch </PERSON> said. `` By helping the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> modernize now, we can create the climate and conditions for an even larger trade market in future.'' Economic ties will top the agenda in talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next week between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. In addition to negotiations for more joint ventures, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> hopes to reach agreements in projects ranging from developing the mineral-rich <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in the northwestern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to the construction of factories. <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials also say 12 West German companies will sign agreements with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The companies specialize in producing packaging machines, furniture processing equipment and truck products. The news weekly <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said an agreement would be signed for West German companies to set up a trade center in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Trade between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> dropped from $ 10.30 billion in 1986 to $ 8.30 billion in 1987, but the <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said total trade volume is expected to stabilize at that level this year.

The wounded American was identified by doctors at <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, a 37-year-old free-lance photographer from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Doctors said he was hit in the right knee by a plastic bullet <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> was the first foreign journalist to be wounded in the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Hospital officials identified the dead teen-ager as <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Tbaileh </PERSON>, 14, of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said he was shot in the chest. The 5-year-old boy died at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after being shot in the chest, stomach and left arm as he played in a schoolyard, hospital officials said. The boy, identified as <PERSON> Deyaa </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON>, was shot when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers opened fire on youths who threw stones at their patrol car from the schoolyard, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. Doctors said both Palestinians were killed by plastic bullets. The deaths brought to 301 the number of Palestinians killed in the 10-month-old uprising in the territories seized by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Six Israelis also have died. An army spokesman confirmed the two deaths. The army also confirmed that <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> was wounded. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' central market area has been the site of repeated clashes between Palestinians and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. An Arab journalist said the troops opened fire today after Palestinians threw stones. <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> was on assignment in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the biweekly Oakland-based newspaper Frontline, said <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennis </PERSON>, a writer for the publication. He also works for Impact Visuals, a photo agency in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Bennis </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> was standing near the entrance to the central market `` near a group of young men chanting and banging on doors.'' She said a group of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers was about 150 yards away. Ms. <PERSON> Bennis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> told her: `` Suddenly, without warning, the soldiers began firing.'' She said she did not see the shooting. Ms. <PERSON> Bennis </PERSON> said doctors told <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> that because the bullet was imbedded in soft tissue above the knee, removing it would cause more damage. `` So they will clean the entrance wound and keep him on antibiotics in the hospital for three days to prevent infection,'' she said. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consul said, `` The consulate will seek to contact Mr. <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> as promptly as possible. We are concerned about the safety and welfare of Americans.'' The Israeli army introduced plastic bullets last August to supplement rubber bullets, tear gas and lead bullets in quelling riots. Injuries have soared, and the use of the new ammunition has drawn criticism from the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as well as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Plastic bullets are not usually lethal if fired from a distance of more than 70 yards. The government says they were issued to give soldiers an alternative to firing lead bullets. Ms. <PERSON> Bennis </PERSON> said she and <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> have been in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for three weeks working on a story about Palestinian life. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said they had no record of <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> being accredited to work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

Mrs. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> claimed that both the university and the fraternity failed to curb the consumption of alcohol and the smoking of marijuana by students at the party that preceded her daughter's death. After a non-jury trial before Common Pleas Court Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dauer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastright </PERSON>, 19, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the Feb. 8, 1987, killing of <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, 20, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastright </PERSON> is serving a life sentence at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>.

The stabbing would not have occurred, the suit contended, if <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastright </PERSON> `` had not been crazed by the large amount of alcohol, combined with the quantity of marijuana.''

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today barred the anti-Arab Kach movement of American-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> from running in the Nov. 1 election, saying it was racist and undemocratic. But the high court permitted an Arab-Jewish party that calls for an independent Palestinian state to remain in the race. Police ordered silence among 50 singing supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Kach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Judge <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Eilon </PERSON> then read out the terse decision, saying `` the appeal is rejected.'' The panel of five judges later released a 27-page judgment on the appeal in which they wrote that `` the aims of Kach and its actions are racist and that it seeks to violently deny the rights ... of segments of the population.'' The high court ruled 3-2 that the Progressive List for Peace could remain in the race. The Arab-Jewish party calls for direct talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and an independent Palestinian alongside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The appeal to the court from the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the <LOCATION> Tehiya </LOCATION> party came after it had been rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The rightist parties argued the Progressive List for Peace should be ousted on grounds that it sought the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a Jewish state. Polls say Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> are in a close race in the Nov. 1 election. The Brooklyn-born <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, 56, told a news conference that the unanimous court decision to bar his party was undemocratic. `` In Judaism, there is no democracy,'' said <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, who was thronged by dozens of supporters, some wearing yellow T-shirts with the party emblem, a clenched fist inside a Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> urged his supporters to boycott the elections. His ouster was expected to strengthen right-wing parties and might give <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> the election advantage. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> had said it would not form a coalition with <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> because of its racist policies. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> has called for the expulsion of the 1.5 million Arabs living in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, as well as the 700,000 Arabs residing within <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s borders. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the demand was racist, and banned the party Oct. 5 under a new law barring racist parties from running for office. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> appealed that ruling. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> immigrated to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1971 after founding the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, a militant organization blamed for attacks on Arabs and other opponents of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Also today, Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian teen-ager and a 5-year-old boy and wounded an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> photographer in clashes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The army confirmed the deaths and the wounding of American <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Doctors at <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> was hit in the right knee by a plastic bullet The deaths brings to 301 the number of Arabs killed since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied lands began Dec. 8.

 Coverage of the presidential election by sound bite is n't serving the public, but what the news media is dishing out appears to be what the public wants, new CBS News President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, appearing before television critics for the first time since he moved over from <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in July, said he did not know how to steer the public's attention, and thus the news media's, away from glib quotes and flashy images and onto important issues. `` I sort of sense an unwanting to know among the public. I mean, the public is buying the flag factories and Pledge of Allegiance and card-carrying this and card-carrying that,'' said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>. `` I suppose we have n't done our job well if we do n't keep beating on them that they should n't be paying attention to that, they should be paying attention to other things. `` I fault us, I expect, for being members of this same public and not being willing to put on the hair shirt and say, ` Sit down, we're going to talk to you about the federal deficit.''' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, 52, is the first outsider to head <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. He had been at <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> for 11 years and had served as executive vice president since 1986. Before entering the news business, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> worked in Democratic politics, as secretary to former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> in the 1970s, and in the 1960s as administrative assistant to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said he supported `` CBS Evening News'' anchor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>'s decision not to serve as a panelist on the second presidential debate, calling the forum `` contrived. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> was a panelist on the first presidential debate in September and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> was one of the questioners for the vice presidential debate earlier this month. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said the League of Women Voters was right to withdraw its sponsorship of the second presidential debate because of the numerous restrictions insisted upon by each candidate. `` Those debates were a contrivance,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` ... He -LRB- Rather -RRB- was uncomfortable with it, I was terribly uncomfortable with it. ... I think it was the right decision, absolutely the right decision.'' As far as <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>' regular programming, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> indicated strong devotion to `` CBS This Morning,'' the 11-month-old morning talk show, and to `` 48 Hours,'' a prime-time documentary series that premiered last season. He hedged on the future of `` West 57th,'' the on-again, off-again newsmagazine that has languished in a Saturday night time period since last season. But the news division has no alternative time period to suggest, and the network is not anxious to replace it with more expensive entertainment programming, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` It's not in stone,'' he said. `` ` 48 Hours' is in stone. The morning is in stone.''

But <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` would be extremely concerned if any donation were accepted in return for the release or lenient sentencing of suspected terrorists. `` Such arrangements would be likely to encourage further terrorist attacks,'' he said.

 White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> today said `` there is no legal problem'' with <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s practice of borrowing expensive gowns and jewels over the last five years. At the same time, the No. 2 man at the Office of Government Ethics said his agency sees no need at this time to reassess its 1982 opinion concluding that such reporting was not required under the Ethics in Government Act. At his daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news briefing, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` There are a lot of questions and we believe all the questions have been answered satisfactorily.'' `` As far as we're concerned, there is no consequence'' for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s financial disclosure forms and tax forms, the spokesman said. `` There is no legal problem. There is no ethical problem,'' he added. On Monday, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, deputy director of the Office of Government Ethics, said that office in 1982 had concurred with an opinion by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legal counsel Fred Fielding that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was not technically required to list the gowns as loans on her husband's financial disclosure form. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said today that `` at this time, there is no belief here in the office that the decision was not the correct one.'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> also said, however, that `` if there's any indication of any error that we made in the past, we clearly would take another look at it.'' <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, the first lady's press secretary, denied that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has kept any of the expensive items she obtained from designers and jewelers. She said in a statement late Monday that `` Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regrets that she failed to heed'' the advice of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel in 1982 to report such transactions, but that this was not technically required under the Ethics in Government Act. Today Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said of the first lady: `` Basically, she set her own little rule. She made a promise not to do this again and she broke her little promise because she just did n't feel she had to do it -LRB- disclose the transactions -RRB-.'' The spokeswoman noted Monday that the Office of Government Ethics had ruled in 1982 that `` loans of apparel to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> need not be reported on the president's financial disclosure forms. No paid-for apparel need be reported on any forms,'' the spokeswoman's statement said. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said the issue was first raised in 1982, when then-White House counsel <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Fielding </PERSON> sent a letter to the ethics office detailing the situation at the time. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> said Fielding concluded that this `` was not something that needed to be reported'' on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s financial disclosure form. The forms are required under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, then-director of the ethics office, agreed with Fielding's conclusion at the time, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been operating under that guidance since then. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did report such transactions anyway on her husband's form in 1982, about six months after the question arose. She said the first lady decided at the time `` to err on the side'' of compliance but acknowledged that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stopped reporting the loans thereafter. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokeswoman said the first lady has not kept any of the numerous dresses and outfits loaned to her by designers. `` To a typical woman, there are some gowns that are so spectacular that you would only wear it once,'' she said. `` The apparel Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> received was either paid for, given to her personally as gifts by old friends, and not subject to reporting, or loaned to her and returned,'' she said. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said, however, that any time a question is raised about a decision by the ethics office, a review process is triggered, and that such a reassessment will take place in this instance. The matter of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s use of expensive, borrowed clothes was raised in the current edition of Time magazine. It said she continued to accept and wear expensive evening gowns and other outfits furnished by leading couturiers such as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Galanos </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> after saying she would discontinue the practice. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Blazakis </PERSON>, a former business associate of <PERSON> Galanos </PERSON>, said he has identified more than 300 photographs of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> since 1982 in which she is wearing outfits worth more than $ 1 million total. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> designer <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> told Time that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has kept some of the 60 to 80 made-to-order outfits she borrowed during the past eight years. `` We think of it as loans. It's wonderful,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. `` She has been a sensation for my business.'' The Time article included pictures of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wearing expensive gowns while posing with, among others, French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. The article said she borrowed gowns ranging in value to as high as $ 22,000 for one such outfit. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said that `` for any first lady, there have been mounds of things that you have to go to, and you have to borrow, and it's not illegal.'' `` I think she has made Americans so proud'' of the way she has represented them at official events, the press secretary said. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> described <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as `` upset over these attacks'' on the first lady. He said that no internal review had been commenced in the wake of the Time report, saying `` I do n't know that there needs to be one.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidential salary is $ 200,000 a year, and his 1987 tax form disclosed modest income that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had received in talent fees and residuals from appearances on network television shows, but no information about her clothing.

<HEAD>Police Employee Suspended After Tow Truck Hits 17 Cars</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A police department driver was jailed awaiting arraignment Tuesday on charges he went on a 60 mph rampage with his tow truck, ramming 17 cars, pushing them into rowhouses and injuring at least five people. <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatten </PERSON>, 36, a six-year civilian employee, was suspended from the department with intent to dismiss after the Monday night incident, said police spokeswoman Cpl. <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hatten </PERSON> was charged with being an intoxicated chauffeur, four counts of reckless endangerment and three counts of simple assault, Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hatten </PERSON> was on duty but had no assignments in the area, and police had no motive, she said. `` I'm not giving out any information,'' a woman who answered the phone at <PERSON> Hatten </PERSON>'s house said Tuesday before hanging up. A number of residents tried to stop the truck before a man turned off the ignition, police and witnesses said. The truck was moving about 60 mph when it started hitting vehicles and pushing them into the front porches of two-story rowhouses in north <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Echevarria </PERSON>, 17. `` It was ridiculous,'' said witness <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. `` He was a humongous man and he kept trying to drive away. And when he could n't drive anymore, he tried to fight his way out. He was hitting all these people _ it was not even funny.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said the driver sideswiped two cars by a tire shop, backed up, then drove hard up the street, hitting a van and pushing it into a porch. As neighbors began to crowd around, the driver again backed up and gunned the engine, scraped more cars, backed up again and finally stopped when it hit another car. `` He had no bumper and the motor went out, so then he wanted to get out of the truck and leave,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. `` He kept punching people. He broke a guy's lip. So then the people started getting mad and hitting him.'' It was the second time in five weeks that a driver crashed into multiple vehicles on <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> streets. On Sept. 13, a mystery driver hit more than 30 cars on seven blocks in the city's <LOCATION> Holmesburg </LOCATION> section and escaped on foot. No arrests have been made in that case, which is still under investigation, Cpl. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Carp </PERSON> said Tuesday. Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the two cases are not believed to be related.

 Eight snakes snatched from their zoo cages were returned unharmed in cloth sacks, but the reptile rustlers who kept them over the weekend slid into hiding, police said. Juveniles were apparently keeping the two boa constrictors and six pythons from the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Zoo at a house in a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb, authorities said. But before police could follow up on a tip, the snakenappers left the dwelling. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a curator, said he was at the zoo Monday evening when a father and son came into the office and said the boy had something he wanted to return. The snakes, worth an estimated $ 8,000, were in cloth sacks, he said. No arrests have been made in the case. `` We're just relieved they're back,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, referring to the six pythons and two boas. Zoo director <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliff </PERSON> said the snakes were taken from their cages in a work area at the zoo between 5 p.m. Friday and 11 a.m. Saturday. Workers found no signs of forced entry, and lids still covered the snakes' cages, some of which were found latched. `` I do n't know how they could have gotten them,'' <PERSON> Iliff </PERSON> said. `` We have to make sure it does n't happen again.'' <PERSON> Iliff </PERSON> said none of the snakes is poisonous, but whoever took them would have needed some knowledge of reptiles to pull off the heist. The snakes did not appear to have been abused or neglected, <PERSON> Iliff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. The theft of the boas especially worried zoo officials, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Furber </PERSON>. The two snakes came from <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> and are listed as an endangered species because their forest habitat is being destroyed.

 They cast 231 ballots trying to elect a mayor, but the acting mayor and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> finally gave up early Tuesday and went home to bed. `` I think the people of Westover deserve better than what we're providing,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Talerico </PERSON> before the five-member <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and Acting Mayor <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koon </PERSON> gave up trying to elect a replacement for former Mayor <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Teter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, who resigned last month The council and <PERSON> Koon </PERSON> adjourned their meeting early Tuesday after failing to break a 3-3 deadlock between <PERSON> Koon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON>, a town Sewer Board member. <PERSON> Koon </PERSON>, 53, and <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON>, 57, were among eight applicants for the job. During the nearly six-hour meeting, <PERSON> Koon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Talerico </PERSON> had a showdown over <PERSON> Koon </PERSON>'s right to vote for herself. State law says that `` no member of the governing body of any municipality shall vote upon any ordinance, order, measure, resolution or proposition, in which he may be interested other than as a citizen of such municipality.'' Citing the statute, <PERSON> Talerico </PERSON> said <PERSON> Koon </PERSON> should not be able to vote because she would receive a hefty pay increase if elected mayor. <PERSON> Koon </PERSON> is paid $ 1,500 annually as the town's recorder. The town's mayor receives $ 10,000 annually. `` I contend that you, <PERSON> Lottie </PERSON> <PERSON> Koon </PERSON>, have an $ 8,500 interest in who becomes mayor of <LOCATION> Westover </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Talerico </PERSON>, who drew a chorus of groans, hoots and catcalls with the statement. <PERSON> Koon </PERSON> said the Secretary of State ruled she had a right to vote. <PERSON> Talerico </PERSON> argued that only the state attorney general could make such a ruling. <PERSON> Koon </PERSON> countered that she had consulted with that office, too.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s effective use of chemical weapons against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is likely to encourage other countries to acquire them, and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> probably have already done so, according to a report released Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> may also have secret arsenals of nerve agents and other chemical weapons. In its annual survey, the London-based institute also said Soviet conventional forces remain poised for swift attack, with no sign of a winding down or switching to defensive positions despite talk of change since <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took office. In the past year, the numerical superiority of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>'s conventional forces over those of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance has, if anything, increased, the survey said But the institute said a raw count of weapons and manpower _ including a 2-1 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact advantage in main battle tanks _ was too simplistic to judge which side really has the edge. The report refused to offer any overall judgment of the state of the NATO-Warsaw Pact conventional balance. In long-range nuclear weapons, a six-percent increase by both superpowers to some 14,600 American and 11,700 Soviet warheads left them equally matched. `` Despite this numerical disparity, we judge that equivalent strategic parity remains,'' said institute deputy director Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>. The survey was gloomiest about chemical weapons. It said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could attack the entire <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> area with chemical and biological weapons sprayed from aircraft or delivered by missiles, free-fall bombs or artillery shells. It also indicated that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of mustard gas and other nerve agents likely served as an advertisement, particularly in Third World countries, for the weapons, which have been condemned internationally as inhuman. `` The role of chemical warfare in the Iran-Iraq war ... is more likely to be seen as an encouragement to the future use of chemical weapons in other regional conflicts, than as a discouragement,'' the survey said. <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Heisbourg </PERSON> said unless an international conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> next year bolsters a 1925 protocol banning chemical weapons in any war, more countries will acquire them. The protocol has been undermined by use of chemical weapons in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war and by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> using them against Kurdish rebels this year. Attempts to get a global ban on such weapons are stalled. `` Unless the authority of the protocol is internationally reaffirmed ... I suspect that other countries which theoretically could produce chemical weapons will be tempted to do so,'' said <PERSON> Heisbourg </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> are strongly suspected,'' he added. `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has used chemical weapons against <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> in 1966 so there is a presumption there, while <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is closing no options ... with the perceived Syrian threat.'' Only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> acknowledge having chemical weapons. But the institute said up to 20 more countries, including <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, were suspected of stockpiling or preparing to produce the weapons. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> says it has a 50,000-ton chemical weapon stockpile _ one-sixth of the total estimated by Western analysts. The institute supported the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' resumption last year of production of binary weapons _ separate agents that are lethal only when combined, saying that without a global ban `` deterrence is the only policy for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to follow.'' On <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact-NATO conventional forces, the survey showed the main disparity in battle tanks: 22,200 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> tanks deployed from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the Urals, facing 53,000 of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. Globally <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> had 33,600 tanks and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact 68,900, compared with 30,500 and 68,300 the previous year. Soviet conventional forces exceeded defense needs and were `` configured and deployed in a fashion which favors high-speed, short-warning, offensive -LRB- or counteroffensive -RRB- operations.'' Meanwhile, with only <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> increasing defense spending in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> may be hard-pressed to maintain its present forces, the survey said. `` Any significant response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> calls for increased European burden-sharing seems unlikely,'' The institute also said <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> may now be able to make nuclear weapons. Four other officially non-nuclear powers _ <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ have long been suspected of having atomic weapons or being able to produce them.

 A blind, 75-year-old man says a teen-ager saved his life by rushing into his burning mobile home and pulling him to safety. `` I could n't get out on my own,'' said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>. `` For one thing, I'm blind and for another, there was too much heat.'' Witnesses called the boy a hero, saying that only moments after the pair escaped, the mobile home burst into flames and blew out the windows. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, 15, said he does n't understand all the fuss. `` I saw the smoke. I knew he was in there so I got him out. He was yelling for help,'' said the youth. The high school junior, barefoot and shirtless, heard the man's cries Saturday afternoon while he was walking through 41 Pines Trailer Park He saw smoke coming from the trailer where <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> lived alone. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said he went to the front door, found a fire extinguisher and doused the flames in the living room. The teen-ager could hear the man yelling, but could n't see him because of the thick smoke. He called for <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> to come to him, but there was no response. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> went to a rear door. It was locked. He punched out a window, unlocked the door and went back into the trailer. `` I grabbed him by the arm and pulled him out,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. `` He kept saying he wanted to get his shoes, but it was too far gone to let him back in there.'' The only injury reported was a minor cut to <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>'s foot. Land O' Lakes Fire Chief <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said fire trucks arrived just as the teen-ager came out of the trailer with <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>. The blaze was started by careless smoking, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. The youth said he learned a little about firefighting from his father and two of his uncles, all of whom have been volunteer firefighters. `` He did what anybody with common sense would do. He went in there and got the old boy out,'' said the teen-ager's proud uncle, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON>, a volunteer firefighter at Land O' Lakes. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, resettled in another trailer, has another pair of shoes the teen-ager gave him to replace those he lost in the fire. The elderly man is grateful to the youth. `` I knew him when he was just a little kid; he's always around there somewhere. That kid's OK.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> was reluctant to take on Republican Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> again after losing to him in a landslide two years ago. But now a costly battle over ethics has turned the race for governor in the nation's tiniest state into a surprising cliffhanger. <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>, a multimillionaire communications executive who lost by a 2-to-1 margin in 1986, has capitalized on news stories about <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> family land deals, about <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> administration handling of a major unfinished bridge project, and about state contracts for trash hauling and engineering services awarded to <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> campaign contributors. <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>, who said early private polls showed him as much as 50 points behind, has drawn even and surged ahead in some recent surveys. A telephone survey of 400 likely voters conducted for local radio and television stations after an Oct. 10 debate between <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> showed the race too close to call, with <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> receiving 40 percent support and <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> 38 percent, well within the poll's 5 percent margin of error. A week earlier, <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> had an 11 percentage point lead. `` What I've noticed is that neither candidate has made much of an inroad into the 15 percent undecided,'' said <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Haupt </PERSON>. `` From what I've seen, the undecideds break fairly heavily for the challenger. They want a change. ... `` I expect finally, the last week, people will start choosing sides.'' <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>'s support, moreover, remains soft. One poll showed that about two-thirds of those surveyed said they were voting more against <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> than for <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>. <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> is striking back at <LOCATION> Sundlun </LOCATION> while trying to steer the campaign focus to jobs, the economy and education, all areas where he claims to have brought progress to <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> said the state has prospered because of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s general economic boom <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> responded that his administration positioned the state to take advantage of that boom. The Nov. 8 election will be `` a referendum on the job I have done during the past four years,'' <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>, who seeks his third two-year term, said in closing Monday night's second debate between the pair. <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> still is considering an offer of a third televised debate. On Tuesday, he received the endorsement of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 9,000 state workers. The union cited his fairness and accessibility. <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>'s campaign has hammered at `` the $ 2 million <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> land deal.'' <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>, former mayor of <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, denied any wrongdoing after <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> officials rezoned a piece of property for apartments and <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>'s family firm then bought it and sold it the same day for a $ 2 million profit. But <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> launched a television ad in late September, telling viewers: `` I sense that some of you may believe that I've let you down. If this is true, then I'm sorry.'' <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> ads charge that <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Outlet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, mismanaged that company to a loss; `` ran -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Outlet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- into the ground'' before selling it to a company that later closed the chain; and was involved in the Executive Jet Aviation scandal of the 1970s that led to the downfall of the <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> denies those charges. `` I have seen my reputation sought to be destroyed in 30 seconds _ 30-second spots,'' he said. The barrage of ads and counter ads is costly. Recent campaign finance reports show that in September, <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> spent $ 577,000, incuding about $ 90,000 per week for televison and radio. <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> lent his campaign $ 495,000 during that period and has provided most of the $ 1.4 million in loans outstanding, <PERSON> Haupt </PERSON> said. The campaign had about $ 10,000 left, but <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> was prepared to loan more, <PERSON> Haupt </PERSON> said. From July through mid-October, <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>'s campaign reported spending more than $ 1 million, including more than $ 100,000 per week in television and radio ads beginning in September. Most of his money came from individual and corporate contributions, along with a $ 200,000 bank loan. Observers agree the race is one of the most expensive in memory in this state, which has a population of just under 1 million and is geographically the nation's smallest.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> wants to cut its basic interstate long-distance rates by an average of 3.8 percent and its business service prices by up to 6.2 percent to reflect savings in local network costs. The cuts, totaling $ 697 million annually, would take effect Dec. 1, the day that residential and small business customers begin paying an additional 60 cents per month to pay the costs of maintaining the local phone network. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T estimates that subscribers who make at least $ 16 a month in interstate, long-distance calls would offset the addition of the subscriber line charge. The average residential customer spends $ 8.66 per month on interstate, long-distance calls, the company said. Those totals do not include intrastate long-distance calls. As subscribers pay more of the costs to maintain the local network, long-distance companies pay less. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> requires <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, the nation's largest long-distance company, to send these savings back to consumers by lowering rates. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's competitors are not required to return these savings to customers, but the companies have tended to lower their rates in response to <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T price cuts. The two largest competitors, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday they would review <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's plans <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houser </PERSON> said the company `` will maintain a competitive rate structure'' and `` will be passing the access line savings along to our customers.'' But he said <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> could not be specific until it has fully reviewed <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's proposal. Sprint spokesman <PERSON> Syd </PERSON> <PERSON> Courson </PERSON> said the company wanted to review <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's proposed cuts before commenting on its own plans. `` We do n't know what we will do right now,'' he said The price cut, if approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, would be <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's seventh since 1984, when the company was stripped of its local operating companies by an antitrust decree. Since then, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's rates have fallen 38 percent. Subscribers, however, pay $ 2.60 per month for local network costs in a fee called the subscriber line charge, which was first imposed in 1985 as a way to shift the costs of the local network to local customers. That charge is scheduled to rise to $ 3.20 per month on Dec. 1. A consumer advocate, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmelman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said he was concerned that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> has structured its rate cut to benefit the company's special discount services designed for large users. As an example, he pointed to <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal to cut rates for its volume discount plan called Reach Out <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by 4.9 percent, but drop basic long-distance rates by only 3.8 percent. The 3.8 percent decrease would apply to basic long-distance rates for calls traveling more than 124 miles. The decrease would be about the same for daytime, evening and weekend calling periods, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T said. Rates for calls of shorter distances, which account for about one-quarter of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's interstate calls, would be lowered by 1.1 percent. The company cited the need `` to maintain acceptable profit levels'' on those shorter-distance calls. The highest cut would come in rates for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defined </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which would drop 6.2 percent. WATS rates would be cut by 4 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T would restructure the service to bill calls individually based on time and distance, rather than by the current hourly pricing method. This price reduction would take effect Jan. 1, a month later than the others. Rates for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's three <ORGANIZATION> PRO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> WATS </ORGANIZATION> calling plans for business customers would be cut 3.8 percent overall. MEGACOM WATS rates would drop 4.7 percent and MEGACOM 800 rates would decrease 4.8 percent, while basic <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T 800 service prices would go down 4 percent.

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Tuesday he feels `` a special obligation'' to help <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deal with a new generation of younger Americans and manage inevitable changes in the nation's economy Speaking to college students and touring farms in rural downstate <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate spoke of a `` powerful renewal of change'' Republicans have created during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` What is on the new page is dramatic, exciting, a little scary, a world of incredible change, a world of incredible opportunity,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spent the day in his brightly festooned bus, occasionally blaring music from loudspeakers, cruising through what he called `` the heartbeat of this country'' against a backdrop of fall colors on a gloomy and chilly day. At several stops, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was greeted by knots of protesters chanting `` Quayle go home'' and waving signs, but he was cheered by crowds at the events. `` It is a special obligation for me _ one which I feel more deeply every day _ to help <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> define the needs of a new generation of Americans, their challenges, their responses,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said changes are inevitable in the workplace and the economy, adding, `` The question is not whether they happen but whether we will shape the world through them or they will shape us.'' He started his campaign day speaking by telephone with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he hoped at some point that they could get together,'' said spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>. On Monday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters a joint appearance by the two would be `` a little bit counterproductive.'' He stopped Tuesday in a half-dozen tiny towns in a comfortably outfitted bus, stopping occasionally to speak to students dismissed briefly from classes. `` This campaign is full of controlled spontaneity,'' <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> said. On his bus, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> relaxed in shirtsleeves giving interviews with reporters and waving to spectators while a crew from <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' filmed a program about the daily grind of the campaign trail <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> said they switched to a bus caravan because the towns on Tuesday's itinerary were far too small for the campaign airplane. He added that a suporting role in small-town <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is only natural for the No. 2 man on the ticket. With some polls showing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a detriment to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket, there have been suggestions that campaign strategists are trying to keep him out of the limelight. <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> said that was n't the case. At one point <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spoke to hundreds of denim-clad youngsters on a farm near <LOCATION> Chrisman </LOCATION>, sporting a blue Future Farmers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> jacket with his name sewn on the lapel, posing before hay bales and a giant American flag. Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, once mentioned as a potential running mate for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before the GOP convention last summer, came along for the day. `` This trip today sends a message,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> care about the people who live in and work in small-town <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

 Nobel Prize-winning scientist <PERSON> Linus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauling </PERSON> traces his scholarly triumphs to his childhood years in <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, a small north-central <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> community where his father ran a drug store. `` I may very well owe a lot of my understanding of the nature of the world to the introduction I received in Condon,'' <PERSON> Pauling </PERSON>, 87, said at the dedication of an airport that bears his name. About 200 people huddled out of the wind in a hangar at newly named <ORGANIZATION> Condon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> Airport-Pauling Field on Saturday to hear Pauling speak. The <ORGANIZATION> Gilliam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> presented <PERSON> Pauling </PERSON> with a brick from the walkway in front of <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauling </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION>. A red cross and nickel are imbedded in the brick. <PERSON> Pauling </PERSON>, who was 5 when his family moved to <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> in 1906, said he remembered the brick, especially the nickel, because, `` I could never get it out.'' He reciprocated with a cut glass bowl saved from the drug store by his sister in a 1908 fire. Historical society president <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamerrer </PERSON> said the bowl would be displayed in the society's museum. <PERSON> Pauling </PERSON>'s father was a manufacturing pharmacist who prescribed and mixed medicines and salves on a marble slab in his store.

He won his first Nobel Prize in 1954 for chemistry, and won the 1962 Nobel Prize for peace for efforts to ban nuclear testing. His nuclear test ban petition was signed by more than 9,000 scientists in 44 countries. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>'s airport, originally built in the mid-1940s by local businessmen, underwent a $ 1 million renovation, including a new 3,500-foot lighted runway.

<TEXT>
 One of three gray whales trapped nearly two weeks by <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> ice has pneumonia, but biologists say the bleeding and battered behemoths should survive at least until a risky, long-shot attempt at freeing them. An <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skycrane </ORGANIZATION> helicopter was readied to lift off early today from <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to tow a 185-ton Hovercraft-type ice-breaking barge 200 miles northwest to the whales. The trip was expected to take from 25 to 40 hours. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Haller </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the lift was delayed Monday while <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the oil field service company that owns the barge, repaired some of the air skirts on the underside of the vehicle. It had been anticipated the operation would get under way about 11 a.m. EDT today, but it was delayed by a few hours. By midmorning <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> time -LRB- midafternoon EDT -RRB-, fueling of the barge and the process of rigging the helicopter to the barge were almost completed but the barge was still at <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` It took longer to get the barge ready than anticipated,'' <PERSON> Haller </PERSON> said earlier today. `` The crews worked all night, and the pilots want to make sure there's as much daylight as possible.'' The endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales became trapped while migrating south to warmer waters. The 24-30-foot-long mammals were bleeding and battered from continually bashing into the jagged ice and were exhausted from swimming against the ocean current to remain in place. The whales were trapped 18 miles northeast of this Inupiat Eskimo village. They were only a few hundred feet offshore in 45 feet of water, with their largest ice hole about 10-by-20 feet. Villagers and biologists used ice picks Monday to keep the breathing holes open in the 6-inch thick ice, but sub-zero temperatures threatened to seal them. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said he and several veterinarians went onto the ice Monday to study the whales, and noticed that one had symptoms of pneumonia. `` Their condition has worsened since they were first spotted,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. `` One has a little pneumonia but the others are all right. We're being cautiously optimistic. `` We've got only one way to go, and that's up. But there's no question in my mind that they'll be here when the vehicle arrives.'' The whales ordinarily can stay underwater nearly four minutes without air, said <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, a North Slope Borough biologist. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said they have been surfacing about every two minutes, indicating they were becoming tired and under stress. Biologists said they are surprised the trapped whales have not drawn the attention of polar bears, and they carried shotguns Monday night in case the large predators showed up. They said they were overwhelmed by the interest in the trapped whales. `` Every year, probably dozens of grays drown or are crushed by the ice, but nobody ever knows about it,'' said biologist <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>. The interest even extended to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may call the people in charge of the whale rescue this afternoon to offer moral support. Rescuers raced against onshore winds that threatened to close breaks in the ice that would serve as an escape route if the ice-breaking barge is able to free them. `` It was 17 below last night,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` The thickness of the ice is increasing rapidly. It's growing a matter of inches every day.'' Environmentalists, federal authorities and the oil industry have joined in the unusual alliance to rush the icebreaking barge to the whales so it can crush a narrow path to open water a half-dozen miles away. Crews labored around the clock during the weekend and into the Arctic darkness Monday to get the barge and the Skycrane ready. `` We're not going to move that thing until we can make sure we'll have a clean run to <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Leathard </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Veco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil field servicing company that owns the barge. `` The Arctic is not a good place to break down in winter.'' Plans called for the helicopter to pull the 85-by-60-foot barge with an 800-foot cable, <PERSON> Haller </PERSON> said. `` The plan has great potential for danger because of the altitude of the helicopter in the towing position. The nose is down,'' he said. `` The danger is that if a line snaps and comes back up and gets in the rotors, we've got real trouble.'' The helicopter, which costs $ 1,500 to $ 3,000 an hour to operate, will trade off with a second Skycrane, which has been flown to <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The barge is to carry 20,000 gallons of fuel for the helicopters and the barge, <PERSON> Haller </PERSON> said. The fuel was provided by <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Oil company officials have estimated that that portion of the rescue effort could cost as much as $ 500,000 <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> arrived here Sunday with recordings of migrating whales that she wants to play along the ice floe to lure the whales to safety. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> grays number about 20,000 and have been growing an average 2.5 percent a year for the past decade. The whales spend their winters in the warm waters off <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is trying to bolster his organization in vital states by sending dozens of aides from his national headquarters into the field and backing them up with more than 1,300 new volunteers from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, aides said Tuesday. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, director of operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign, said about 60 percent of the workers at the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> headquarters are being assigned to target states for the final three weeks of the campaign. He could not provide a specific number. Among the senior <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides assisting with the drive is <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, who since the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in July has been working on plans for a transition to a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presidency. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native, has temporarily delegated her transition duties to a deputy and now is focusing, from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, on Southern states in which the Democrats believe they are still competitive, principally <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Joining the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> operatives being assigned to field operations will be more than 1,300 new volunteers from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, who runs <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' headquarters there. That group consists of congressional aides who have taken leaves, numerous attorneys with ties to Democratic politics and college students from area campuses, Ms. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said. `` It's a pretty encouraging sign, I think, about how strong we are going to be in the field on Election Day,'' <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> said. `` We have a very strong grass-roots organization. It got us through the primaries and it is one of the things that is going to pull us through on Election Day.'' Volunteers, depending on their prior election experience, will be assigned tasks ranging from political work in target precincts to helping with phone banks and distributing leaflets, Ms. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said. Some of the congressional aides, most of whom have worked on prior campaigns, are being sent back to their home states but many also are being assigned to key states, she said. `` Our state party offices are quite capable of running a very effective get-out-the-vote effort but you need bodies to do that,'' she said Tuesday in a telephone interview. `` This will give us the influx of people we need to win on election night.'' The congressional recess also will allow the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign to schedule more appearances by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who have volunteered to serve as surrogates for the Democratic ticket, <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> said. Recent polls have shown <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> well behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but Ms. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said party officials calling her office to request more volunteers have been relaying a far more optimistic picture. `` State party chairs will call and say, ` I know I can win my state but I'm worried about this state or another state,''' she said. `` We're very encouraged by what we're seeing in the states.''

 A grand jury will be asked to review the scalding death of a deaf 9-year-old girl at a state-run school because a prosecutor said he's not convinced her death was accidental. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Driggers </PERSON> died last Thursday from first - and second-degree burns she suffered in a hot shower, according to a preliminary report issued by Medical Examiner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> He ruled the death an accident. However, Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> has taken testimony from three paramedics and subpoenaed medical records from <LOCATION> Flagler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and the doctor who treated the girl. `` You can say accidental, accidental, accidental, but I've not been convinced,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said Monday. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for the Deaf and <PERSON> Blind </PERSON> said new statements from witnesses show the girl slipped in the shower and hit her head before being scalded to death. <PERSON> Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadson </PERSON>, 29, the staff member supervising <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, was placed on leave with pay, school officials announced Monday. The girl's mother, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Driggers </PERSON>, said she does n't believe her daughter entered the shower on her own because she was terrified of hot water and questioned why she did n't get out of the way of the hot water. <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said there was no evidence that anyone else was involved in the death, although Mrs. <PERSON> Driggers </PERSON> said she thinks her daughter may have been held under the water. Earlier, school officials reported that the girl ran into the shower after becoming ill in the bathroom. But on Monday Assistant Principal <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutto </PERSON> said it appeared the girl slipped and banged her head when she was hit by the scalding water. <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said he found a bump on the back of the girl's head while conducting the autopsy. `` The question still remains, why did she go into the shower, and when the water hit her, why did she fall back rather than get out of the water?'' <PERSON> Hutto </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Driggers </PERSON> said the child had twice been previously injured at the school. The girl was assaulted by a roommate last year and fell in the shower at the school in November 1986.

The deaths raised to 301 the number of Palestinians killed since Arabs launched the uprising Dec. 8. Six Israelis also have died. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied the territories since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was hit in the right leg while photographing a demonstration in the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> market area. The army spokesman had no details on the child's death but said soldiers opened fire in the market after demonstrators threw stones and bottles. The spokesman, who can not be identified under military regulations, said <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> was close to the rioters and `` endangered himself'' by being in the area, which was closed to outsiders under military orders. <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> and five Palestinians ranging in age from 16 to 23 were wounded, hospital officials said. All suffered plastic bullet wounds, they said. Hospital officials have reported six deaths by plastic bullets since the army introduced their use in August. Plastic bullets are intended to supplement rubber bullets, tear gas and lead bullets in quelling anti-Israeli riots. They are not usually lethal if fired from a distance of more than 200 feet. But doctors have said the plastic ammunition can kill if it penetrates the neck, chest or abdomen, and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> deaths and injuries from the bullets have drawn <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, British and Egyptian protests. <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> was covering the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> protest for Frontline, a biweekly newspaper published in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. He also works for Impact Visuals, a photo agency in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Frontline writer <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> was standing in the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> market `` near a group of young men chanting and banging on doors.'' She said a group of Israeli soldiers was nearby. `` Suddenly, without warning, the soldiers began firing,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bennis </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> as telling her. She said she did not see the shooting. Ms. <PERSON> Bennis </PERSON> said she and <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> have been in the country for three weeks reporting on Palestinian life under the occupation. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said they had no record of <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> being accredited to work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> plans to file a formal complaint with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate after his return to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Bennis </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate general in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is investigating the circumstances of the shooting. Also Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> barred U.S.-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> from running in the Nov. 1 election, saying his anti-Arab Kach movement is racist. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> told reporters that he was urging backers to boycott the vote.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s 80 mph winds churned across the open <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> today on an unusual southern path that has forecasters puzzling over its potential strength and possible landfall. There was a report that the storm left 50 people dead or missing in a town in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> the day before. `` <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> is one of a kind,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center. `` You just do n't see many hurricanes that take this course and hug the coast.'' In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, an official of the state of <LOCATION> Bolivar </LOCATION> in the northern part of the country said the storm triggered flooding in the town of <LOCATION> Carmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bolivar </LOCATION>, about 360 miles north of the capital of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Water roared down three gullies in the town as the storm passed Monday, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, a state government administrator, told the Colombian radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>. `` Preliminary reports from the mayor's office indicate that about 50 persons are dead or missing'' in the town, he said. At noon EDT today, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s center was near latitude 11.1 north and longitude 76.3 west, about 70 miles west of the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> coast and about 380 miles east of the island of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION> off the coast of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The hurricane was moving west at 10 mph and was expected to continue that motion through today. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> issued a hurricane watch for its north coast, and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> issued a hurricane watch for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION>, which is part of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> even though it is located close to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> season's fifth hurricane, is expected to bring 4 to 8 inches of rain along its path. As a tropical storm with 45 mph winds, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> slowly built its strength as it skimmed <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s coast, baffling forecasters who had predicted it to weaken. It reached hurricane force Monday night and its center began to become better defined, a sign the system could intensify over open water into the western <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, forecasters said. On its present path, it would be at least 48 hours before the main part of the hurricane reached <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said late Monday. Gross said a strong high-pressure system over the northern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> is keeping <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> on its course. Normally, prevailing winds and upper-level atmospheric conditions push tropical storms northward as they move from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, said Gross. Also, he said hurricanes are often sapped of strength in the far southern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> due to trade winds that push colder deep-ocean water to the surface, said Gross. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> became the 10th named storm of the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season when top winds passed 39 mph on Oct. 11. Hurricane strength is 74 mph. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, the most devastating hurricane in recent years, left more than 300 people dead and caused billions of dollars damage as it tore through <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> peninsula last month. The six-month hurricane season ends Nov. 30.

<HEAD>`Rust Belt' Making Income Gains, But Coasts Still Prevail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Income growth in the `` Rust Belt'' manufacturing states is staging a comeback after lagging behind the national average for most of the 1980s, the government said Tuesday. The trend represents an easing in, but not an end to, a phenomenon <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration critics have labeled the `` bicoastal economy.'' The administration has pointed with pride to the six-year economic recovery, the longest during peacetime since the Civil War. However, critics say the nation's heartland has not shared in the expansion. In a report on non-farm personal income, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said, in general, states bordering the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coasts continue to have better income growth than the states in between, but the gap in the growth rates is narrowing. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, a center of the boom in computer and other high-technology industries, still leads the nation in income growth. From the second quarter -LRB- April-June -RRB- of 1987 to second quarter of this year, income grew 9.5 percent, compared with 8.7 percent average annual growth since the end of the last recession in the third quarter of 1982. New <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s growth for both periods was well above the national average of 7.7 percent in the 12 months ending in June _ the latest period for which figures are available _ and the 7.1 percent annual average for 1982-87. The growth rates are not adjusted to remove the effects of consumer price inflation, which was 4 percent in the 12 months ending in June. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachussets </LOCATION> posted particularly strong income gains of 10.7 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively, in the latest year available. But gains in manufacturing have pushed income growth in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> states up to average, and growth in <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states has climbed from the middle ranks to above average. In the 12 months ending in June, growth in the <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> region, led by <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, was 8.7 percent, compared with 7.4 percent annual growth in the 1982-87 period. Growth in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region, which lagged behind during the years of the overvalued dollar and exploding trade deficit, was 7.7 percent in the 12 months ending in June, compared with 6.2 percent earlier in the decade. Meanwhile, income growth in the Far West and the Southeast has cooled a bit from above-average rates. The Southeast, part of the `` Sun Belt'' boom of the early 1980s, inched down to a 7.5 percent growth rate from 7.9 percent in 1982-87. The Far West cooled to 7.8 percent in the latest 12 months, down from 8.2 percent. The Plains states, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> area, all dependent on either agriculture, mining, oil drilling or a combination, all showed improvement, but remain at the bottom of the list. Income growth in the Plains was 6.2 percent in the 12 months ending in June, up from 5.9 percent earlier; in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, 5.8 percent, up from 5.5 percent; and in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> area, 5.2 percent, up from 5.1 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attributed gains in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> states to strength in the manufacturing of durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years, and in construction. It said the <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> region also benefited from a pickup in manufacturing. Economists had been anticipating income gains in the manufacturing `` Rust Belt'' of the nation. The drop in the value of the dollar over the last three years has made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods less expensive on overseas markets and has fueled a boom in export sales this year. In a separate report Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said virtually every one of its 12 regional banks were reporting `` continued strength or expansion ... across a wide range of -LRB- manufacturing -RRB- industries.'' However, the report prepared for a Nov. 1 meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy makers, said `` manufacturers are becoming less optimistic about coming months.'' They've become more cautious about the first half of 1989 following a slight slowdown late this summer, the report said. Although income growth in the Southeast as a whole was down, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, by state it was mixed. Weak growth in incomes from service jobs in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and interior states more than offset strong growth in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast states of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Trial in Ethnic Rioting Begins in Moscow</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three Azerbaijanis went on trial Tuesday on murder and arson charges in riots that killed 32 people and highlighted ethnic tensions. The defendants were flown in from the Azerbaijani capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> and taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in three unmarked gray trucks. About two dozen Armenians stood silently outside the building holding copies of death certificates for the victims, many of whom were their relatives. The group later was allowed into the courtroom. Azerbaijanis went on a rampage Feb. 28 in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, an industrial city on the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. They burned and looted buildings, hunted down Armenians and killed them, official and unofficial reports have said. Of the 32 victims, 26 were Armenians and six were Azerbaijanis, officials said. Official reports had said more than 200 people were injured, but a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency dispatch Tuesday gave a figure twice as high. Some Armenians say the death toll was much higher and have cited <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> as a national tragedy they will never forget. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Suren </PERSON> <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON>, said Oct. 8 that <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> was `` an unhealed wound in people's souls.'' The rioting was sparked by a massive Armenian campaign for control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. In addition to violence, the dispute over the mostly Armenian district has triggered strikes in the southern republics of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The two ethnic groups, of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s more than 100 nationalities, differ in culture and religion. Foreign reporters who waited outside the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> building were not allowed to attend the trial. Court officials told the reporters they need the permission of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, but the spokesman for that agency, <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, said the trial was not open to correspondents. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> did not say why reporters were barred. A court official, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the defendants as ethnic Azerbaijanis and gave their names as <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhmedov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ilgam </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yavar </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzhafarov </PERSON>. The official said each was accused of participating in the murder of one person. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said they were charged with `` organizing and and taking a direct part in mass disorders accompanied by pogroms, acts of arson and murders.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted a court official as saying dozens of witnesses would testify and that the indictment was more than 100 pages long. The death certificates held by Armenians bore pictures of the victims and descriptions of how they were murdered. Many in the group wore black and displayed buttons of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s national flag. Moving the trial to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> represented a victory for Armenian activists who had complained that previous legal cases stemming from the rioting were biased because they were conducted by Azerbaijanis on their territory. On July 8, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and prosecutor's office shifted the cases to the Russian federation, an Armenian demand. Tuesday's trial in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the capital of the federation, was the first in an unknown number of cases the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will hear in the rioting. Before the change of venue, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on May 15 convicted an Azerbaijani metalworker of pre-meditated murder in the rioting and gave him the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. Officials have said more than 80 people have been charged in the unrest. Twenty-five people already have been sentenced, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday, but the official press has carried little on the cases, and even <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON>, the Armenian party first secretary, complained. `` We see how the obviously delayed investigation reopened old wounds, how people are shaken by the fact that the legal examination is being conducted in various cities of the country and that no information is coming into the republic about who was punished, what the sentence was,'' <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON> said Oct. 8. He said the most serious of the cases would be heard by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 Several House members found themselves in ethical or legal trouble during the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who was indicted on perjury charges this week, is one of the few who also is in trouble with the voters. Republican <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is trailing his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> challenger, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, by 51 percent to 33 percent in their suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> district, according to an Oct. 13-14 poll cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. By contrast, Rep. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Tenn., indicted April 24, 1987, on bank fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy charges and still awaiting trial, has only token opposition in his bid for an eighth House term from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> Many lawmakers who have been investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee have encountered little challenge _ or none at all _ in seeking re-election. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> also is unusual because he is the lone <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> in a sea of problem-plagued Democrats, a circumstance the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> committee attributes to politically motivated complaints of ethics violations. `` Most of these charges are pretty unfounded, and the bottom line is the voters will re-elect these people on the merits of their service,'' said committee spokeswoman <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>. `` The voters serve as jurors on Election Day.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, 38, was indicted on 10 counts of lying to a grand jury investigating a drug money-laundering scheme. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> says he will represent himself at his trial, which could begin as early as Monday, and expresses confidence his name will be cleared before the Nov. 8 election. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a recovering alcoholic and an actor who played Cooter the mechanic in the television series, `` Dukes of Hazzard,'' is taking his second shot at <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s seat. He held <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> to 53 percent of the vote in 1986, before any of the Republican incumbent's current troubles began <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is the 16th congressman to be indicted in the past decade and the third in the current <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, after <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and former Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <PERSON> D-N.Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> resigned after his conviction in two unrelated corruption cases, but his name will appear on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ballot as a Republican. Numerous other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members were investigated by <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> ethics panels in the past two years, but few if any seem likely to suffer negative consequences in the election three weeks away. Last December, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reprimanded Rep. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, D-Pa., for permitting votes to be cast in his name when he was absent, diverting <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resources to his former law firm and putting a ghost employee on his payroll But <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who represents a heavily <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> district in western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, faces only token opposition to re-election. Another member, Democrat <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, was `` sharply rebuked'' by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics panel in March for borrowing campaign funds for personal use. He is expected to win re-election easily. So is House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the highly visible target of an ethics committee investigation triggered by Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has no rival for his <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> seat The ethics panel is investigating six allegations against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, including using his office improperly to lobby government officials on matters in which he had a financial interest, and receiving unusually fat royalties from a book published by a campaign contractor. Others who were targets of ethics investigations included: _ Rep <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics panel cleared him of wrongdoing last year after a 14-month investigation into allegations he had used his influence to amass a $ 2 million fortune in real estate investments. Still pending are allegations that he failed to report meals and entertainment paid by a housing industry lobbyist. Recent polls show <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> with a nearly 2-1 lead over a weak opponent. _ Rep <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, D-Ohio. She kept an aide on her payroll for nearly two years after the aide had moved from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, in violation of House rules. Ms. <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON> reimbursed the government and was not disciplined, and she has virtually no competition in seeking re-election. _ Former Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Boner </PERSON>, D-Tenn The ethics panel said in December that <PERSON> Boner </PERSON> improperly used campaign funds for a trip to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and may have accepted a bribe from a defense contractor in the form of $ 50,000 in legal fees paid to his wife. But <PERSON> Boner </PERSON> had already resigned to become mayor of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, and the panel said it no longer had jurisdiction. In addition, at least two congressmen allegedly subjected female aides to sexual harassment. One of them, Rep. <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Konnyu </PERSON>, R-Calif., was the first and only incumbent to lose a primary this year The other, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, D-Calif., is expected to win re-election Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, D-Md., had a rocky year His administrative assistant committed suicide after a newspaper reported that the aide had required young male staffers to socialize with him. And <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s ties with defense contractors were scrutinized in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement fraud investigation. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing and is running against the same <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate he steamrollered by a 2-1 margin in the 1986 election. Another Democrat whose name surfaced in the Pentagon inquiry, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, is also expected to coast to an easy re-election victory. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who acknowledges he is being investigated in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> corruption scandal in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, also is a safe re-election bet. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, is trying to beat the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s demand for $ 90,000 in back taxes from unreported bribe income. <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON> was acquitted after a criminal trial of accepting the bribes, but the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> insists it is owed the money. <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON>'s appeal is pending in federal court, but he faces no problem at the polls.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> plans to order random drug testing for more than 100,000 rail workers assigned to safety-sensitive jobs, <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. Although approximately 250,000 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> work for six major railroad companies, 40 medium-size railroads and about 350 short lines, only 100,000 work in safety sensitive jobs, and only they will be subject to the drug tests, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said Monday. `` In the past 20 months, railroads have had 59 accidents where one or more employees involved in the accidents have been found to have been under the influence of drugs. These accidents have resulted in 33 deaths, 400 injuries and $ 40 million worth of property damage,'' he said Monday. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to address the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said he would soon announce more specifics of the program, aimed at stamping out drug abuse among rail employees and increasing railroad transportation safety. On June 22, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the Rail Safety Improvement Act, which takes effect Jan. 1, 1989. It gives the FRA power, for the first time in its 21-year history, to suspend and fine railroad employees. The new act also will enable the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> to fine railroads up to $ 10,000 per day per count for safety violations _ four times the amount the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> previously was allowed to assess.

 A priest who has mixed liberal New Age philosophy with <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> doctrine has been sentenced to a year of public silence by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, according to a published report. The Rev. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, who has said he was n't afraid to be labeled a heretic, will not be permitted to speak publicly or publish his writings for a year, effective Dec. 15, according to a report in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Reporter, a liberal weekly newspaper. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, 47, is the founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in Culture and <ORGANIZATION> Creation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirituality </ORGANIZATION> at Holy Names College in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. He scheduled a news conference for Thursday to discuss the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s action. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lattin </PERSON>, a religion writer for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>, described <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s curriculum in the paper's Tuesday editions as having a `` heavy emphasis on Christian mysticism, feminism and environmentalism.'' The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Reporter, has ordered <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Names </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> to sever its ties with <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s institute. School officials said they will issue a statement after <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s news conference. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> has irked conservative Catholics by hiring faculty members that include a certified masseuse, a <ORGANIZATION> Zen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>, a yoga teacher and a self-described witch named <PERSON> Starhawk </PERSON>, the story said. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s teachings include a book called `` Original Blessing'' that criticizes traditional church doctrine for an `` overemphasis'' on sin and redemption. When news of a possible <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> investigation was reported in 1985, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said he was `` not upset if people call me a heretic.'' `` <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> of Arc was condemned, burned at the stake and then declared a saint,'' the Dominican said then. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s teachings have been under review by Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON>, whose Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ordered the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> dismissed in 1986 from the faculty of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, for doctrinal liberalism. <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON>'s office was once called the Holy Inquisition. Action against <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> could revive tensions between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church that surfaced during the <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> controversy and after <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> disciplined liberal <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Archbishop <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunthausen </PERSON>. The National Catholic Reporter said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> will partially defy the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> order by taking a one-semester sabbatical. `` This work is just too pressing to be postponed until a neurotic papal regime dies out,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> was quoted as saying. He reportedly referred to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> action as `` a compliment. It shows our influence is growing so much that they feel threatened.'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> has based his writing in part on the ideas of <PERSON> Meister </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhart </PERSON>, a German Dominican who died in 1327 and whose teachings were condemned as heresy in 1329 by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> XXII. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> has denied his `` creation spirituality'' is the same as pantheism, the belief that everything is God and God is everything. Pantheism is considered heresy by the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s institute, which he founded in <ORGANIZATION> Mundelein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1978 and moved to <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> in 1983, offers a master's degree in spirituality and has instructed scores of priests and nuns

<HEAD>Panel Urges Investment In Healthier Babies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal panel called Tuesday for universal access to prenatal care by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women as a way to reduce the number of babies born diseased and handicapped _ and save a lot of taxpayer dollars in the process. `` The most basic problem is that our nation has failed to give adequate priority to the principle that all pregnant women _ not only the affluent _ should receive prenatal, delivery and postpartum services,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> study committee. The panel's two-year survey started out trying to determine what type of outreach programs would be most effective in providing pregnant woman with prenatal care. But it soon concluded that the problem ran deeper than women not being aware of services available to them. `` Our central conclusion is that outreach efforts are no match for the pervasive barriers faced by low-income women in trying to secure adequate prenatal and maternity-care services,'' <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON> said at a news conference where the 254-page report was issued. `` As is so often the case, the principal barrier is money,'' said <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON>, who is dean of the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION>. The report said about 26 percent of women of child-bearing age have no insurance _ public or private _ to cover maternity care and that two-thirds of these, or about 9.5 million women, have no health insurance at all. In many ways, the panelists concluded, money itself is not as much of a problem as lack of will to make a national commitment to tackle the problem in a comprehensive way. Although there would be an initial investment of new funds to expand Medicaid to cover more pregnant women, for example, the money would pay a three-fold dividend by producing more healthy babies and thus fewer sick and handicapped ones to care for at public expense. `` For every dollar spent on prenatal care for low-income, poorly educated women, about $ 3 are saved in medical expenses for low-birthweight babies during the first year of life,'' said <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON>, citing figures from a 1985 Institute of Medicine study. Indeed, many of the fundamental findings in the new survey track two studies released in recent months by the <ORGANIZATION> congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to Prevent Infant Mortality. <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON> said the major new conclusion of the latest study is that trying to refine outreach programs for women in need of prenatal care is more or less wasted effort until actual barriers to such care are removed. A majority of the six panelists at the news conference expressed optimism that the nation will provide proper prenatal care in the near future _ in part because multiple studies seem to have demonstrated beyond doubt the sheer cost effectiveness of such programs. `` If anything gets attention, it's dollars and cents,'' said panelist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. `` I just do n't think this nation is going to go on paying to take care of handicapped infants when we can prevent the handicaps with proper prenatal care.'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> is an obstetrics and gynecology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> medical school in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. The panel was blunt in its conclusion that the time has come to act rather than study the problem to death. `` The committee specifically urges that no more research be conducted to demonstrate the importance of financial and other institutional barriers to care,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Ohio Governor Demands that Reagan Close Uranium Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> demanded Tuesday that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> shut down a government-owned uranium processing plant until something is done to stop the radioactive pollution it produces. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> admitted Friday at a congressional committee hearing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the government has known of dangerous environmental problems at the Feed Materials Production Center since it was established in 1951, <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said. The governor said he wrote a letter to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> demanding that the plant, located in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> about 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, be closed. The plant processes uranium for use in nuclear weapons, which are made elsewhere. `` This admission of deceit and mismanagement confirms and emphasizes what we have known in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> for a long time: This facility is an environmental disaster threatening the health and safety of thousands of Ohioans,'' <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> wrote. The letter demands that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the plant, pay for an independent evaluation of plant employees and nearby residents to determine how their health has been affected. The governor also said the department should treat and stabilize radioactive thorium at the plant; begin a final cleanup of radioactive waste stored in two deteriorating concrete silos; and start identifying the contents of 200,000 containers of waste that have accumulated as a result of what the governor said is the department's negligent management of the plant. <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said they believe the plant has been better managed since <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> took over its operation in January 1986. But they said they are concerned about more than 30 years of radioactive emissions into the atmosphere and into the water table. The Energy Department admitted in January 1985 that faulty exhaust air filters at the plant had allowed the release of at least 200,000 pounds of radioactive uranium oxide dust into the atmosphere during the past three decades, including at least 3,000 pounds from 1980 to 1985. Five people who live near the plant then filed a $ 300 million, class-action lawsuit alleging that the former operator, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was negligent in failing to prevent the uranium releases and that the releases contaminated property and may have caused health and personal injuries. The lawsuit is pending in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The Energy Department prompted the new furor by admitting in court documents that government officials had been aware of potential environmental problems at the plant, but still directed National Lead managers to proceed with uranium processing. The state sued the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, charging it with polluting the environment at the 1,050-acre site. That lawsuit also is pending in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said the state, which tried to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for a cleanup, received no cooperation until the lawsuit was filed. `` When <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s concern about conditions at the facility led the state to attempt to become involved, the door was repeatedly slammed in our faces. Essentially, we have been told that this major threat to public health and safety is none of our business,'' <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said in the letter. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Reafsnyder </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s site manager, declined comment Tuesday and referred queries to spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. She was unavailable for calls. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a White House spokeswoman for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> already has begun what is billed as a $ 500 million, decade-long project to clean up and modernize the plant.

<TEXT>
 A 26-year-old woman has been sentenced to 30 days in jail for embezzling almost $ 5,000 to pay for her wedding to a sheriff's deputy because she `` wanted to look better than her sister did.'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> was sentenced Monday after pleading guilty Aug. 28 to embezzling $ 4,870 from what was then <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Plainwell </LOCATION>, where she worked as a teller. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> used the money to pay for her wedding in August 1985, according to court records. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Enslen </PERSON> also ordered <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> to pay full restitution to her creditors. `` This is n't the worst crime I've ever seen,'' <PERSON> Enslen </PERSON> said, `` but it's the shallowest. `` You say that what you wanted was to look as good as your sister or better,'' <PERSON> Enslen </PERSON> said. `` Your father had already contributed money that he probably did not have and you repaid that kindness by stealing.'' Because <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, is an <LOCATION> Allegan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy, she will serve her sentence in the <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> or Kent County Jail. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> declined to comment on his wife's sentence. `` You knew that your husband was a law enforcement officer, but it was n't important to you that he might be embarrassed,'' <PERSON> Enslen </PERSON> said. `` What a terrible crime to commit.'' Asked by <PERSON> Enslen </PERSON> if she had anything to say for herself before he sentenced her, <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> cried `` I'm sorry ...'' then began weeping and could not continue. `` My client has had lots of physical and emotional problems due to this circumstance,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalzell </PERSON>, the woman's attorney. `` What she did was obviously wrong and she knows that.'' According to court records, among the items <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> purchased with the embezzled money were a wedding dress veil that cost $ 300, wedding invitations that cost $ 200, a wedding cake that cost $ 150 and a band for the reception for $ 500.

<HEAD>Forest Service Using Reforestation Fund For Firefighting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has raided a key reforestation trust fund to cover more than $ 500 million in firefighting expenses over the past two years, and the agency's budget director said Tuesday he's not sure where the money will come from if next summer is a bad fire season `` The problem is where are we going to get funds to fight fires in 1989?'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leasure </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leasure </PERSON>'s comments came as an <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> congressman on Tuesday introduced legislation that would create a special fund to cover the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s firefighting expenses. Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said that under his bill, half of the agency's reciepts from timber sales in national forests and other fees would be deposited in the special Emergency Fire Fighting Trust Fund. Money left in the fund after the firefighting costs were paid would be turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. `` As it is now, the potential for disaster is immense,'' said <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>. `` We might not have money for reforestation or to fight fires. The present system just is n't working.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has traditionally sought only a token amount for firefighting costs in its annual budget. The agency would borrow from one of its other accounts if more money was needed and then ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> later for additional funding to repay the account. <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said, however, that a budget agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration essentially eliminated the possibility of any supplemental appropriations and that any effort to secure additional funding to cover firefighting costs could `` trigger'' the automatic budget cuts established under the Gramm-Rudman act. `` It's a mess,'' said <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>. Recently, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has been borrowing heavily from the so-called Knutsen-Vanderberg trust fund. Fees timber operators pay when they log in the national forest are deposited in that fund and the money is earmarked for reforestation projects. Over the past two years, the K-V fund has been drawn down from a high of about $ 800 million to a current level of about $ 120 million, <PERSON> Leasure </PERSON> said. Collections from the timber harvesters during the current fiscal year should add between $ 175 million to $ 200 million to the K-V fund, or barely enough to cover the cost of reforestation projects. `` We do n't expect any difficulties paying for reforestation in -LRB- fiscal -RRB- 1989, but it's obvious the trust fund has been drawn down to just operating levels,'' said <PERSON> Leasure </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leasure </PERSON> said the administration had yet to review <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>'s legislation, but admitted the entire issue of paying for firefighting costs and reforestation was `` an issue of concern to us and many people. <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said that it is well past time for the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to `` make the books honest. The K-V fund is not a deep pocket. It is the K-V fund which keeps the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> timberlands renewable. They will not be renewable if we rob the fund.'' <PERSON> Leasure </PERSON> said that a total of $ 508 millon was taken from the K-V fund to pay for $ 400 million in firefighting costs this year and $ 108 million from last year. Even tough <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recently appropriated $ 125 million for firefighting, <PERSON> Leasure </PERSON> said the forest fire season, particularly in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, is not over.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pledged Tuesday to wipe out the nation's $ 150 billion trade deficit in four years and lashed out at <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a man with `` no convictions, no ideas and no plans.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drew enthusiastic crowds at stops in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> as aides contended the race is closer than indicated by polls pointing to a big Democratic defeat. He depicted the election as a choice between one candidate who will stand up for average Americans and one who is the champion of the well-to-do. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cares about the people on Easy Street. I care about the people on Main Street,'' he said in a speech on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> campus. With the poll news ranging between bad and worse, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his aides have been seeking a spark to ignite his faltering campaign. One woman in his university audience did her best to oblige. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate had just finished saying, `` The difference between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and me boils down to this'' when she loudly interrupted, `` You're real and he's not.'' At that, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> jumped out of his seat on the stage behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and pumped his fist up and down energetically and exhorted, `` Let's go'' while the audience cheered enthusiastically. For one day at least, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his candidacy seemed to be generating enthusiasm lacking since last Thursday's poorly reviewed debate performance _ from <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s cheerleading to crowd chants of `` <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>.'' In <LOCATION> Saginaw </LOCATION>, he declared that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` wants to help those who have it made. I want to help every American family make it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration have done nothing to solve the root causes of the 1987 stock market plunge, which occurred one year ago Wednesday. `` We've got to end the Republican rainbow coalition of red ink for our children, pink slips for our workers, greenmail for sharp operators on Wall Street and golden parachutes for top corporate executives,'' he added. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> moved through a three-city tour in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> with statewide polls showing him trailing in the race for the state's 20 electoral votes. His aides seemed far more concerned, though, about an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> survey showing a 55-38 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead nationally. Senior aides told reporters at every turn, as they did on Monday, that they do not believe the poll. They said other surveys show much smaller margins. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' first speech of the day produced noticeably sharper rhetoric, along with his announcement of a goal of eliminating the trade defitic. He said in four years the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had created the world's largest trade deficit `` and cost our workers five million jobs.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would meet his goal of eliminating the trade deficit by reducing the budget deficit, increasing foreign trade, investing in education and training and putting more emphasis on research and development. `` How about world hunger?'' was the skeptical retort by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> when told of the Democrat's promises. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added, `` And we're going to give industries that have been battered by Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reckless policies the breathing space they need to retool with new technologies and compete with new skills.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> scorned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s approach to the same problem. `` Well, he's got the flags and balloons. But no convictions, no ideas and no plans,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He said his Republican rival does n't want to talk about his plans and said, `` Maybe it's because he has n't got the vaguest ideas how to end the trade deficit, how to rebuild out heartland and how to revive Main Street.''

<HEAD>Soybean Oil May Provide Claimed Benefits of Fish Oil</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Healthy people on a typical <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diet may have to look no further than their salad dressing for benefits that some people are seeking from fish oil capsules, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scientists said Tuesday. Chemist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emken </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the human body rapidly converts a part of the soybean oil used in some ordinary food products into the same kinds of fatty acids found in fish oil. Two men in a preliminary study consumed the soybean oil component, linolenic acid, and within a few hours their bodies had coverted it into the same omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and marine oil, <PERSON> Emken </PERSON> said. `` Think of it this way: the body can naturally make its own fish oil omega-3 fatty acids from the linolenic acid in soybean oil,'' he said in a report released by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency. The report said capsules of fish and marine oils have been `` touted by advertisers and debated by nutrionists'' as dietary supplements. In any case, the capsules, it said, have become popular with any consumers hoping to ease or prevent conditions ranging from heart disease to rheumatoid arthritis. <PERSON> Emken </PERSON> led the study at the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and was helped in the work by <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. `` Our study is the first to show that linolenic acid is rapidly converted to omega-3 fatty acids found in marine oil,'' <PERSON> Emken </PERSON> said. `` The study also provides direction for further research to learn which dietary fatty acids, including those in fish and soybeans, best meet human nutritional needs.'' Soybean oil is the only major domestic vegetable oil that contains much linolenic acid and makes up 79 percent of the vegetable fats in the average <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diet, the report said. The fats are in such foods as shortening, margarine and cooking oil as well as in salad dressing.

 One of the decisive factors in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decision to accept a cease-fire with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was a prediction by the radical Revolutionary Guards that they could not achieve any victory over the Iraqis until 1993, according to a document released Tuesday. The Peoples' Mujahedeen of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, a group seeking to overthrow the government of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, released what it said was a transcript of a July 17 meeting at which the decision to adopt a cease-fire was announced to the senior Iranian leadership. The detailed transcript sheds light on the Iranian decision, which has not been publicly explained and has led to much speculation. The authenticity of the document could not be independently verified, but previous documents released by the organization have proved generally reliable. `` Now that our military officials ... openly admit that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> will not achieve any victories whatsoever in the near future ... I accept the cease-fire,'' said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in a message to the gathering read by his son <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>. The ailing leader did not take part in the eight-hour meeting, which was attended by some 40 people including <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and senior military officers. In his message, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> cited specifically `` the shocking letter of the <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> commander'' <PERSON> Mahsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezaij </PERSON>, who sought to continue the eight-year war. `` We wo n't have any victories in the next five years,'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> reportedly quoted the commander as saying. `` After 1993, if we have 250 brigades, 2,500 tanks, 3,000 armored personnel carriers, 300 aircraft and 300 helicopters, we believe, God willing, we will be able to launch offensives,'' the letter reportedly said. Diplomatic sources have said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, chronically short of money and isolated by an international embargo, was suffering severe shortages of combat aircraft, tanks, radar and other weapons. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> also said his government's bank accounts `` are below zero'' and `` the people have no desire to go the fronts ...'' In his address to the Iranian people on July 20 announcing the cease-fire, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> did not explain his reasons for what he said was a `` very bitter and tragic issue for everyone.'' In a series of Iraqi offensives earlier this year, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> lost virtually all the territory it had captured in the eight-year war. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> described to the participants several Iranian losses, citing the battle on <LOCATION> Majnoon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in which he said Iranian forces retreated without suffering any casualties, leaving 70 boats for the enemy. He said supplies were so low that Iranian forces did n't even have sandbags Other officials spoke of confusion within the military, the deterioration of the economy and an energy shortage. The transcript also recorded a harsh exchange between <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son and Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashami </PERSON>, who criticized the cease-fire decision. But <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son defended his father. `` One day he said war. Now he says peace. Tomorrow once again he might advocate war. There's no contradiction in this.''

 The president of the World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the East Germans have agreed to accept moral responsibility and pay reparations for the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> extermination of 6 million Jews, but he would not give specifics. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> also said he hoped for better relations between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which have never recognized each other diplomatically. `` I have been given the understanding that serious consideration is being given to some renewal of relationship,'' he said. <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>, 59, spoke to reporters at the end of a three-day visit to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that included meetings with <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, president and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief; Foreign Minister <PERSON> Oskar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, and other officials. Before meeting <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> said he expected a reparations agreement. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had said it would provide unspecified `` humanitarian aid'' to Holocaust victims. `` I have had very good, clear meetings here,'' <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> told the news conference in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` I am totally satisfied on two counts. The first is ... the moral position that <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germany </ORGANIZATION> is taking on its responsibilities on the Holocaust. The second point is payment to the sufferers and survivors.'' He also referred to an international Claims Conference supported by the World Jewish Conference, which in the past has handled reparations issues for Holocaust victims. `` I understand that the negotiations that took place between the -LRB- East German -RRB- government and the Claims Conference have been completed,'' <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> said. `` They will be lived up to and the details and communications will be worked out and reported. `` I am completely satisifed with the results. I have nothing further to say on the payments question. It is not my responsibility to discuss the details.'' <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> was asked about a statement by <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, a West German Jewish leader, that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would pay up to $ 100 million, and replied: `` The $ 100 million was not part of my mission.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has a chronic shortage of hard currency and has not been expected to make substantial payments, but any offer of reparations would be a major change from its previous policy. It has claimed since its founding in 1949 that it bears no responsibility for <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s atrocities because it was created after World War II, and has stressed that Communists also suffered under Nazi persecution. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has paid more than $ 48 billion to Holocaust victims and their relatives since it signed a compensation agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1952. In recents months, East German official media have reported government efforts to improve relations with practicing Jews in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, who number only 450-600. About East German pledges to renovate and maintain Jewish synagogues and cemeteries, <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> said Tuesday: `` I'm very satisfied with the symbolic arrangements.'' The official East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> covered the visit extensively and reported <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>'s remarks on the talks between the Claims Conference and <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s government. A front-page story in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> was accompanied by a photograph of <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> shaking hands.

 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called Tuesday for a summit meeting with North Korean's president to sign a non-aggression pact and said his country `` will never use force first against the North.'' In the first address by a Korean leader to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said such a summit should `` resolve all the problems raised by either or both sides with regard to disarmament, arms control and other military matters.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it only would accept a summit meeting after 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops pull out of the South. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> also proposed the two Koreas meet with <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to lay the groundwork for peace, prosperity and security in <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s allies, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, should `` contribute to the progress and opening of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by engaging <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> in expanding relations,'' the president told the 159-member world body. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> also called for a Korean trade and cultural center on the 38th Parallel dividing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where divided families could visit in a `` city of peace.'' Western diplomats hailed <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s speech, which drew prolonged applause, but there was no immediate comment from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Pak </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Yon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was present in the assembly chamber, but left without speaking to reporters. In <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday of `` maneuvering'' to perpetuate the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> spoke at a banquet several hours before <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> speech. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> again urged peace and the removal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, in his speech, said improved relations and trust between the two Koreas could ultimately lead to the reunification of the peninsula, divided since World War II. `` Even before a non-aggression declaration is made with the Northern side, the Republic of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will never use force first against the North,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said. `` We must do everything possible to hasten the coming of the springtime for peace and reconciliation on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, the permanent <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative, praised the speech as `` one of the most historic and statesman-like speeches I have heard in this hall.'' Japanese Ambassador <PERSON> Hideo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagami </PERSON> said `` we hope very much that today's speech will contribute to dialogue, reduction of tensions and reconciliation.'' On Wednesday, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Sok </PERSON> <PERSON> Ju </PERSON>, will address the world body. The appearance of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> president and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> deputy foreign minister is the result of a compromise. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and other nations proposed last summer that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> should speak on the 40th anniversary of its 1948 founding. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other socialist nations opposed the idea, saying a speech to observe one national day only would fan tensions since the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> was divided. It later was decided both sides would speak separately on the question of reconciliation and dialogue. The two Koreas hold <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> non-voting observer status because their peninsula is divided and they still technically are at war. The 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice and no peace treaty was signed. On Thursday, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> meets President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 The governors of seven states and about 1,000 business and government leaders from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Southeast will meet here this week to talk about doing business with each other. They are delegates to the joint annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States-Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and its Japanese counterpart, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan-Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

They alternate their yearly sessions between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. This is the first time they've met in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` Japanese interest is acute in the <LOCATION> Southeastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottle </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` A two-day meeting wo n't solve the trade imbalance,'' but it has the advantage of giving leaders a chance to talk face-to-face, he said. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> are the other states represented in the association. While the states are usually in keen competition for industrial investment, for the meeting `` we need regional cooperation to pull it off.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> barred U.S.-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> on Tuesday from running in the Nov. 1 election, calling his anti-Arab Kach movement racist. The unanimous ruling was expected to benefit the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> in its close race with the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. An angry <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, speaking at a news conference, urged backers to boycott the vote. One agitated activist tore up his <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> indentification card needed for voting, scuffled with bystanders and was dragged out of the room. The court also ruled the Progressive List for Peace, which calls for an independent Palestinian state, could compete in the elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> had demanded the party's ouster for allegedly seeking to destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Jewish character. In its unanimous ruling on <ORGANIZATION> Kach </ORGANIZATION>, the court found that <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> incites `` racism and negates the democratic character of the state.'' The 56-year-old, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, N.Y.-born founder of the militant <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> demands the ouster of all Arabs from Israeli-held territory and a ban on Jewish-Arab marriages. The movement's symbol is a clenched fist inside a Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON>. The court ruled on a Kach appeal against a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to bar the movement from the elections. The decision was based on a 1985 law banning parties advocating racism and opposing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Jewish or democratic character. But <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> said there was a `` contradiction between Zionism and democracy,'' noting that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Law of Return discriminates against non-Jews by granting automatic citizenship only to Jews. He spoke during a chaotic news conference that was repeatedly interrupted by supporters chanting `` <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, king of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> urged supporters to boycott the elections, saying he wanted to punish <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, which had joined Labor in supporting Kach's ouster from the race <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> won a seat in the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 after three failed attempts. Analysts said many Kach supporters would probably ignore the boycott call, and support the extreme right-wing parties <ORGANIZATION> Tsomet </ORGANIZATION> and Moledet instead of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Tuesday his party would not make a special appeal to Kach voters. But even if potential Kach voters switch to other right-wing parties, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would benefit because potential coalition partners would be strengthened. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, rejected demands by <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that the Progressive List for Peace should be barred from the election because it allegedly seeks to destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Jewish character by negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Tehiya first challenged the <ORGANIZATION> PLP </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and then took their case to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Also Tuesday, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told reporters that the struggle of Palestinians to achieve independence was `` useless'' and that there would never be a Palestinian state. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign platform, published Tuesday, suggested that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would annex the occupied territories if elected. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has a right and a claim to sovereignty over <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>,'' the platform read, using the biblical names for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will raise this claim and act toward implementing this right.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> telephoned the commander of a whale rescue operation in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> on Tuesday to offer his support, telling him that Americans' `` hearts are with you and our prayers are also with you'' in the effort to save three mammals trapped by ice in the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a five-minute call to Col. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, said he was `` very concerned'' about the plight of the mammals and wanted an `` on-site report'' from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The conversation was piped into the White House press room. The endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales became trapped 18 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, while migrating south to warmer waters. The 24-to-30-foot-long mammals were bleeding and battered from continually bashing into the jagged ice for nearly two weeks. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he had monitored the situation by watching television. `` I just wanted to tell you that everybody down here, their hearts are with you and our prayers are also with you,'' he told <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, who was at a base camp at <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, about 200 miles southeast of the whales. `` Anything that we can say or do to help you along with the success of the operation, we'd be pleased to do it,'' the president added. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> explained to the president details in the planned operation in which a National Guard Skycrane helicopter was to tow a 185-ton Hovercraft-type ice-breaking barge from <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to the whales. The operation was delayed for several hours because the owner wanted to make sure it was totally safe to operate in the harsh environment, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. He said that while the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is coordinating the operation, private companies and groups such as <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> are also involved. `` It's extremely moving when you see the interest that has been generated not only here but across the nation,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. He added that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s call was a morale-booster for the crews working in sub-freezing weather. `` This is the kind of thing that kind of makes it all worthwhile,'' he said. But the big moment will come when the whales are safe, he added.

 The disease AIDS could claim 50 million lives throughout the world in the 1990s, exceeding the toll of the Black Plague in the Middle Ages, according to the World Future Society. The AIDs prediction was the grimmest of scores of forecasts by the society in the November-December edition of its magazine, The Futurist. It said millions of Americans may become ill with AIDS, at an economic cost to the nation of $ 66 billion, even though the disease, whose chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users, is not likely to spread rapidly within the heterosexual population. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> estimates that as many as 10 million people worldwide may be infected with AIDS, with 1 million new cases possible by 1993. As of Oct. 10, AIDS had been diagnosed in 75,437 Americans, of whom more than half, or 42,432, have died since June 1, 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. On the positive side, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> foresees better living conditions both at home and on the job. Technology will help more Americans live in dream houses, with home theaters, housekeeping robots and backyard edens, it said. It predicted employers will offer more family-oriented benefits, including on-site child care, flexible working hours and time off to care for sick children. The predictions summarize a wide range of reports published during the past year by the society, a nonprofit educational group based in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, which encourages research into issues affecting the future. It predicted a continued rebirth of inner cities, with a trend toward more greenery in downtown areas and an interspersing of entertainment and cultural facilities, such as art museums and aquariums, within shopping areas. The society said the AIDS epidemic could have some positive effects if it leads to national health insurance systems and promotes a boom in medical research that could benefit all areas of health care. Other projections: _ The economic rivalry between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could lead to serious trade wars and security differences Japanese control of the most advanced semiconductor technology by the 1990s could further erode <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic strength. _ Computer networks and telecommunications facilities, including those operated by the military, will become popular targets for terrorists _ Businesses will need to provide continuous employee training as the automation and computer revolutions eliminate many low-literacy jobs _ Fraud may become the crime of choice in the future as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> grows older, replacing burglary, which requires the agility of youth _ New discoveries in biotechnology and generic engineering could lead to the replacement of nerve cells, arteries, hormone-producing cells and even brain cells Artificial implants will become more common. _ If current trends continue, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will face a shortage of 1.2 million nurses by the year 2000

 The nation's factories are booming thanks to strong export sales, but a slight slowdown late this summer has left manufacturers cautious about next year, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` Manufacturers are becoming less optimistic about coming months'' despite current strength, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said in a review of the economy based on reports from its 12 regional banks. The report lends new weight to the prevailing view of economists that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will refrain from pushing interest rates higher at least until after the Nov. 8 elections and possibly until early next year. `` Virtually every district indicates continuing strength or expansion in the industrial sector. Many cite rising exports as a primary source of demand,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> report, known internally as the `` tan book.'' The expansion encompasses a wide range of industries, including chemicals, paper and pulp, steel, autos and trucks and machinery, it said. However, it added, `` several districts say a slight slowdown became evident in late summer and that manufacturers, forseeing a leveling-off of activity through the first half of 1989, have become very cautious.'' The report will be used as a starting point for discussions when <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers gather on Nov. 1 to map monetary strategy. Manufacturing, aided by an export boom fueled by the lower value of the dollar, has led economic growth this year. But demand has been so strong that analysts have worried it will cause production bottlenecks and higher prices. In an effort to fight inflation by curbing demand, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> pushed up interest rates from late March through early August. Reports from the district banks prompted the board's most dramatic move on Aug. 9. It raised a key bank lending rate, the discount rate, from 6 percent to 6.5 percent. The central bank has refrained from further tightening moves since then, waiting to see if economic growth slows to what it considers a sustainable, non-inflationary pace. In other economic sectors, the report found: _ The summer `` drought will have a much smaller impact on farm income than was originally thought. A fall in crop yields has been largely offset by higher prices and federal aid to farmers. _ Retail trade, particularly women's clothing, is `` weak or slow in most areas. However, car sales have been strong in most districts. _ The decline in oil prices has hurt the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area, which reported a 14 percent decline in oil wells since May The impact has been less severe in other areas. _ Most districts reported weaker housing construction as builders anticipate higher interest rates Two districts _ <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> _ noted softening home prices. Although business lending is strong, mortgage lending has tapered off.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Call for Vietnamese Withdrawal From Cambodia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday signed with reservations a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and establishment of a free and independent government in that country. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he welcomed `` this clear statement of principles'' on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, but he disagreed with certain clauses which he feared could complicate efforts to ensure that <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rebels never again attain power. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution stipulates that the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people be protected from the return of a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who, under <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> in the late 1970s, are thought to have slaughtered as many as 2 million people. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not specify his reservations, but a White House official said the president's main problem was language in the resolution which did n't conform exactly to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants a withdrawal of Vietnamese troops in the context of an `` overall settlement'' in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, said the official, speaking on condition he not be named. The resolution did not mention the overall settlement, he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, however, said he signed the non-binding resolution because it `` makes clear that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to do everything possible to assure that the Vietnamese occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is brought to an end and that effective guarantees are put into place to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from ever again taking control of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which has installed a puppet government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, announced earlier this year that it would withdraw its 120,000 troops from the nearby country by 1990. The withdrawal, however, will leave a vaccuum. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provides non-lethal assistance to two non-communist groups, including one headed by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the former chief of state. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> met last week with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

 A mechanic on Tuesday became the first person arraigned for allegedly violating <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s new law banning obscene bumper stickers, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said it might challenge the statute's constitutionality. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>, 24, pleaded innocent to the second-degree misdemeanor in <ORGANIZATION> Collier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. He also pleaded innocent to several other misdemeanor traffic and parole violations. If <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON> is convicted of violating the obscenity statute, which took effect Oct. 1, he could face up to six months in jail and a $ 500 fine. Penalties double for repeated violations. With or without the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s help, his attorney said, he will ask a judge to dismiss the obscenity charge. `` My gut reaction is I do n't think it's constitutional,'' said Assistant Public Defender <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. `` It gives the arresting police officer total discretion to decide what's obscene. <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON> was picked up Friday night in what apparently was the first application of the law passed this spring. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Banjanin </PERSON> proposed the ban because of a proliferation of stickers like the one spotted on <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>'s truck. It sported a popular but scatological version of the saying, `` things happen.'' <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Carres </PERSON>, a lobbyist with the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, said she would consult with the group's headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> about intervening in the case. She noted that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> set precedent on the issue of obscenity in the 1960s in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case in which a draft protester wearing a T-shirt denigrating the <ORGANIZATION> Selective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was arrested after he walked into a courthouse. The high court ruled that the T-shirt's slogan was protected under First Amendment rights of free speech because it pertained to the government. `` I suspect there could be an action brought,'' <PERSON> Carres </PERSON> said. `` I do n't see a difference between a T-shirt and a bumper sticker.'' State Rep. <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who helped draft the bumper sticker ban, said the new law simply adds bumper stickers to other forms of printed and recorded media already covered by state obscenity laws and leaves to the courts to define what obscenity means. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he was n't surprised that the law is headed for a challenge, but questioned how much the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case would help <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>. `` One is going to be hard-pressed to make an analogous argument that something which is a normal bodily function is, in and of itself, an expression of political belief,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, an attorney. `` I think we have regulated the subject matter to the fullest extent allowed under the Constitution and now it will require a case-by-case analysis.'' State Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Alessandro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Collier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> said he did n't think <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>'s case would make a good test for civil libertarians because of the other traffic charges filed against him. He predicted <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON> would end up entering a plea bargain on those charges. In the meantime, the prosecutor is n't making clean bumpers a priority in <LOCATION> Collier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` -LRB- The police are n't -RRB- really going out and instructing their people to start making arrests for bumper stickers,'' he said. A spokesman for the sheriff's office said that while the statute may not generate a lot of prosecutions based only on bumper-sticker charges, it will provide officers with another reason to stop suspicious vehicles. `` It's going to be a tool for the officer. If they've got the obscene stickers, it's one more -LRB- probable cause -RRB- to stop somebody,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>.

 Architects <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Venturi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehry </PERSON> were picked Tuesday to design a plan to turn a 19th century factory into the world's largest contemporary art museum. The two architects joined with two other firms _ <ORGANIZATION> Bruner-Cott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Skidmore </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> _ in their submission for the renovation of the huge <ORGANIZATION> Sprague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant into a museum to house major collections of 20th century art. Their team was chosen by a panel of international art experts and local businessmen and politicians after a two-day study of 23 proposals for revamping the factory. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, the director of the museum's executive planning group, said the architects were chosen because of their reputation. <PERSON> Gehry </PERSON> designed the temporary building housing the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, called the `` Temporary Contemporary,'' and <PERSON> Venturi </PERSON> is working on a wing to the National Gallery of Art in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Both men are known for their odd contemporary designs. <PERSON> Venturi </PERSON>, for example, once designed a building painted in paisley swirls. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, however, said the architects have `` a proven reputation for sensitivity to the context of a project and have shown sympathy for the industrial setting of the site itself.'' The setting for the planned <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> is a 28-building factory in an industrial city in the state's remote northwest corner Among the proposals submitted was a design from Coop Himmelblau of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for a giant contemporary sculpture of straps and metal above the factory. Gae Aulenti of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, submitted an inch-thick book of photographs of her projects, including the <LOCATION> Gare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D'Orsay </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> museum created from a train station. Architect Resources of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> suggested a glass tower and <ORGANIZATION> Cesar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Associates of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, proposed a large contemporary tower in a courtyard to contrast with the factory's clock tower The winning team did not submit a specific design proposal. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said the team will begin working on design and engineering prototypes, and cost and market analyses for a $ 1.7 million study on the project's feasibility. The study will be turned over to the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, which must approve it before releasing $ 33 million in funds earmarked by the Legislature for the renovation.

 Higher commodity prices mean less grain and other items going to needy countries under the Food for Peace program in 1988-89, a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> showed Tuesday. Acting Undersecretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said allocations for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 total about 3 million metric tons of grain equivalent valued at $ 663 million. Under the program a year ago, allocations totaled 4.4 million tons of food commodities worth $ 648 million. Despite the dollar increase, higher prices for grain and some other commodities have resulted in lower tonnages for the new year. For example, a year ago about 3.8 million tons of wheat flour were allocated. In the new allocation, wheat flour totaled less than 2.5 million tons. The Food for Peace program includes titles that allow concessional sales to designated countries for up to 40 years, including an initial 10-year grace period and low interest rates. Another allows the forgiveness of debt incurred under the concessional sales, based on development carried out by the recipient countries. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said $ 139.5 million in unallocated funds has been set aside as a reserve to provide commodities `` for unforeseen needs'' during the year. Last year the reserve was $ 85.6 million. The largest allocations went to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, $ 170 million; <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, $ 80 million, and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, $ 60 million.

<TEXT>
 An Iranian leader said Tuesday that the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war could resume, but that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has a new mystery weapon with which to deter <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> from resuming attacks on cities. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio quoted <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaker of the Iranian parliament and military commander-in-chief, as saying the `` probability exists'' that the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> could break out again. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> considers itself `` neither in a state of war nor a state of peace,'' despite a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had acquired a `` device'' to deter <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but did not describe it. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed on Sept. 27 that his country had developed a weapon only two other countries possessed. He did not elaborate, but said it was not a chemical device. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> each has sought in some degree to develop nuclear capability. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> bombed a French-built nuclear plant west of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> in 1981 to curb <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s potential. Western military analysts dismissed the possibility that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was referring to a nuclear device. Some military analysts consulted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said the Iranians may have a new medium-range missile capable of hitting <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> cities. Most found it more likely that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was engaging in a game of bluff with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which demonstrated during the last round of the `` war of the cities'' earlier this year that it had a greater supply of effective missiles. The radio said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> commented after a three-day tour of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s devastated western region. It quoted him as saying: `` We must not forget that our enemy might have the same motives of the past, although it will not easily welcome the danger of resuming the war because of the situation it has encountered. But the possibility exists.'' Peace talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> stalled almost as soon as they began in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> five days after the cease-fire date. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> insists on sovereignty over the entire Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms the southern border and is its only outlet to the sea.

 In the years after it was founded in 1943, <ORGANIZATION> Radcliffe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Library </PERSON> on the History of Women in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was a sleepy place with few visitors, curators say. But with its official reopening Tuesday after a $ 3.5 million renovation, the library is sleepy no longer. After its humble beginnings in two small rooms in the basement of a building on the Radcliffe campus, the library now occupies the entire structure. Because of the interest sparked in women's studies by the feminist movement, the number of visiting researchers now numbers about 5,000 per year. The library, the only one of its kind in the nation, collects materials on women's roles and contributions from 1800 to the present. It includes a collection so varied that one can study aviatrix <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>'s papers, research the early women's suffrage movement, peruse 5,000 cookbooks or review former first lady <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s `` Book of Common Sense Etiquette. The red-brick building in <LOCATION> Radcliffe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> houses rooms for visiting scholars, film and videotape viewing rooms for oral history projects, photography exhibits, 500 women's interest-periodicals, a planned wooden relief by sculptress <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevelson </PERSON> and the 5,000-volume <ORGANIZATION> Julia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>, named for the famed chef `` It's like a quantum jump in the recognition that real women's issues and history are here to stay,'' said <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>, curator of manuscripts, who has been at the library since 1971 Alongside oil portraits of <PERSON> Lydia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkham </PERSON>, who marketed a well-known patent remedy for women's illnesses, and stained glass artist <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>, visitors can examine more than 30,000 books that concern women. On exhibit are memorabilia from the women's suffrage movement: rattlers shaken by women in suffrage parades, banners and placards reading `` Keep Cool! There Will Be Nothing to Worry About After we Get VOTES FOR WOMEN!'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shenton </PERSON>, assistant to the library director, said the library was almost a closet when she began work there 21 years ago. `` We were in two little rooms,'' she recalled. `` It was such an event when one researcher came that we offered them tea. But the women's movement increased interest in us so much. It just ballooned.'' The library was launched in 1943 as the Women's Rights Collection using papers donated to the college from suffragist <PERSON> Maud </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Radcliffe </PERSON>'s class of 1898. The collection opened to the public in 1949 with 300 books and 1,156 manuscripts. In 1965, the library was renamed to honor <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> history professor, <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, and his wife, who was a historian of women and active in the League of Women Voters. Their son, historian <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, has said that his mother `` raised my father's consciousness.'' In later years, the library began to focus on the contributions women have made to domestic life. An exhibit of etiquette books, such as `` No Nice Girls Swear,'' is on display. One of the most unusual collections consists of cookbooks from the 1800s to the present, stacked in shelves near a huge, blown-up photograph of Child. Her papers are also part of the library. <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAngelis </PERSON>, 25, a third-year student at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, was at the library Tuesday researching women's unions in the 1940s for a legal history class. `` This is the only library where I could find this material,'' she said. Museum staffer <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said that for years women studying at colleges in the area were unaware of the library's existence. `` All of sudden, though, women are a legitimate field of study,'' she said. The renovation of the existing 1908 building was financed by more than 3,500 gifts and grants.

 A technician who plugged a connector into the wrong receptacle caused a flash electrical fire that did minor damage to the $ 216 million <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venus </ORGANIZATION> probe being readied for a space shuttle launch next year, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. Smoke and a 2-to-3-inch flame spurted from a spacecraft battery when the worker tried to insert the cable connector into the wrong slot Monday night, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> project official <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said. `` Technicians on the scene quickly put out the fire within a minute with a halon fire extinguisher,'' <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said. `` But by then the damage was done. It resulted in a short that damaged the battery and wire harness and insulation blankets near the battery.'' He termed the damage minor and estimated it would take five to seven days to get spacecraft preparation back on schedule. He said there would be no impact on the April launch date aboard the shuttle Atlantis. <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> played a videotape made Tuesday that showed some soot damage around the battery area. The battery, he explained, was being used to run routine power system checks in the spacecraft's forward equipment module and is not part of the flight hardware He said the fire deposited `` some soot, grease and grime'' on parts of the spacecraft and that it would have to be cleaned up. He said <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, because of its planetary mission, has to be kept extremely contamination-free and that cleaning experts were being flown in from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and from <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where the craft was built. Because an electrical short was involved, <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said engineers were checking to make certain there was no damage to other electrical components such as the spacecraft signal processor. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> told reporters, `` Apparently the wrong plug was put in the power supply ... I do n't know whether you ever tried to put a multipronged plug into a socket, but it's hard to do. It would n't fit, so he pushed it a little bit and it shorted out the battery. `` We should n't allow this kind of stuff,'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> added. `` It's a human error ... we'll have an investigation and take some steps so it wo n't happen in the future.'' <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said the technician who made the mistake worked for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>, which delivered <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> here on Oct. 8. The spacecraft is being assembled and checked in a processing building. When fully assembled, the craft will stand 21 feet tall and weigh 7,800 pounds. <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said because of the recent delivery, many electrical components still had not been installed, reducing the possibility of more damage, and several protective shipping covers were still in place, cutting down on the spread of soot. Atlantis' astronaut crew is to release the spacecraft from the cargo bay to start it on a 446-day trip to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. While <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> orbits the planet, its advanced radar will peer through the constant clouds and map the surface. Before that mission, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> has another flight assignment. It is being readied here for a late November launch in which it is to carry a classified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payload into orbit. A problem with an actuator that controls the left wing flap has delayed for a few days its transfer from a processing facility to an assembly building where it will be joined with its two solid fuel booster rockets and external fuel tank. A firm launch date will not be set until a flight readiness review scheduled Nov. 9 and 10. The flight will be the second for the shuttle program since the Challenger explosion in January 1986. Discovery completed a highly successful mission on Oct. 3 and is now being groomed for a February launch.

 Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> worked Tuesday on his defense for next week's trial on 10 federal counts of perjury, even as he celebrated his 38th birthday with a letter of congratulations from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a second-term Republican who represents a suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> district, was indicted Monday on charges of lying to a federal grand jury that was hearing evidence gathered during a nationwide money laundering `` sting'' operation by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not mention the indictment in his birthday letter to <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, which read in part, `` May your special day be filled with joy and may the year to come bring you every happiness.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who was granted an expedited trial after saying he wanted to clear his name before the Nov. 8 election, said he has received calls from several attorneys offering their assistance but still intends to act as his own lawyer during the trial. Reminded of the adage that an attorney who represents himself has a fool for a client, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> replied, `` We'll find out the day after the jury comes back.'' During an hour-long interview with two reporters, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> appeared upbeat and relaxed, frequently joking in response to questions about criminal charges that could send him to jail if he is convicted. Asked if he intended to call any members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as character witnesses, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said he might, then quipped, `` I think everybody already knows I'm a character.'' Sitting at a desk covered with cassette tapes and transcripts from conversations recorded during the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> operation, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> acknowledged that he has not tried a criminal case in seven years. In fact, he said, he has tried only four criminal cases in his entire career as an attorney, and in all of those he was assisted by another lawyer. Still, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said he will be ready Monday when jury selection begins and will base his case on `` the ol' innocent defense.'' The perjury charges against <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> stem from his grand jury testimony about discussions he had last year with <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>, an undercover <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent posing as a money broker, about an $ 850,000 home mortagage loan he was seeking.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Tuesday welcomed what he said was a trend toward democracy in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and cited a plebiscite in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> as the latest example, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Soviet news agency said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made the remarks in a speech at a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> dinner for President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s turn for democracy has been welcomed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying. `` It has represented a powerful factor in a general tendency typical of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> over recent years.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> then noted the Oct. 5 plebiscite in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and said it was part of the trend toward democracy in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The decisive popular ` no' to the dictatorship in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has reflected it graphically,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. In the Chilean plebiscite, more than 3.9 million people voted against the proposal that President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remain in power until 1997. The `` yes'' vote was 3.1 million. Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army commander, has ruled <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> with a military government since leading a 1973 coup that overthrew the government of elected President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> became <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first civilian president in 1985 after 21 years of right-wing military rule. From 1964-85, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> shunned high-level contacts with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but maintained trade and diplomatic ties. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, who arrived Monday for a three-day stay, is the first Brazilian head of state to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In his dinner speech, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should work together to preserve their vast forests.

 The Roman Catholic patriarch of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> appealed to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on behalf of Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territories Tuesday and told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials he hoped for official recognition of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Archbishop <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, the first Palestinian to hold the Latin patriarch post, said he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at a 10-minute meeting that `` the Jewish people are enjoying their human rights, the Palestinians are not. Since 1967 they have been living under Israeli military occupation.'' The president said in response that he hopes for an end to violence and peace in the area through negotiations, <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON> told reporters. Meanwhile, 17 past winners of Nobel prizes sent letters to the leaders of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urging negotiations to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. The letters said: `` Negotiations can lead to a settlement which embraces renunciation of terrorism and aggression and the protection of minorities within a self-governed Palestinian homeland.'' `` All parties must at long last realize that they can not have peace without compromise and that there will be no chance of peace without negotiation,'' said the Nobel laureates' letters. <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON> said he had earlier conveyed to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people's hopes that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> eventually will be accepted as their spokesman. `` I mentioned that our representatives are the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> ... we hope that some day the Palestinians will have their rights and their representatives,'' he said. <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON> said the brief meeting did not allow him to broach the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> topic with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> governments reject dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> because of its terrorist activity. <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, whose diocese includes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, is on a month-long pastoral visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Emphasizing that he spoke as a clergyman rather than politician, he said, `` There are two peoples living in the Holy Land, the Jewish people and the Palestinian people ... Both have inalienable human rights ... justice demands giving the Jews and the Palestinians the same human rights ...'' In parts of the Holy Land, torn by an 11-month Palestinian uprising and clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, the patriarch said, `` The oppressed and suffering are the Palestinians, so I must speak for them. Were the oppressed and suffering the Jewish people, I would equally plead their cause ... as the Latin patriarch ... my concern is not only for Catholics, but for all peoples, Christians, Moslems and Jews.'' Archbishop <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION>, was named Latin patriarch by <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and ordained by him in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> last January. Previously, he had served seven years as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION>. The Nobel laureates who signed the letters included <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anfinsen </PERSON>, biochemistry, 1972; <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>, biochemistry, 1970; <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethe </PERSON>, physics, 1967; <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, physiology and medicine, 1964; <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>, physics, 1980; <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, chemistry, 1980; <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Glashow </PERSON>, physics, 1979; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holley </PERSON>, medicine and physiology, 1968.

 First lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` broke her little promise'' to stop accepting expensive designer gowns and jewelry lent to her by leading couturiers, her press secretary said Tuesday. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said that when the practice came into question in 1982, it was decided that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s transactions would be reported on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s financial disclosure form. She also acknowledged that the first lady vowed at the time to discontinue accepting designer clothing. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, then-press secretary to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, told reporters in February 1982 the first lady would stop accepting free clothing. Her purpose was to help the fashion industry, but `` she felt it was being misunderstood,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. `` Basically, she set her own little rule,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispin </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` She made a promise not to do this again and she broke her little promise because she just did n't feel she had to do it.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed its 1982 decision that such disclosures on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s financial forms were not technically required under the Ethics in Government Act. Deputy director <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said: `` At this time, there is no belief here in the office that the decision was not the correct one.'' But <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> also said that officials would reassess the situation `` if there's any indication of an error that we made.'' The ethics law requires reporting by an official, or by the official's spouse, of any loans in excess of $ 10,000 in any year. In 1984, then-Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, was convicted in federal court of failing to disclose on his ethics form two loans made to his wife by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> served 11 months in prison. Questions about Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dealings with designers dominated the White House news briefing for a second consecutive day. Pressed to discuss what implications Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s clothes-acquisition proclivities might have on the president's tax forms and financial disclosure forms, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` As far as we're concerned, there's no consequence ... for the president's financial disclosure form or his tax forms, period `` There is no legal problem. There is no ethical problem,'' he said. `` There are all kinds of innuendo and insinuations of illegality and improprieties that are totally incorrect.'' In a May 4, 1982, letter, then-White <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fielding </PERSON> told <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, director of the Office of Government Ethics: `` We have agreed that the practice of making the clothing and other -LRB- personal property -RRB- available for the first lady's use does not constitute a ` gift' within the meaning of that term in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, and therefore it need not be reported in the president's financial disclosure form.'' Fielding went on to say that `` I advised, nonetheless, that although there is no requirement to list these uses, nor manner in which to evaluate them, the president's report should err on the side of disclosure.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> initialed the letter with his approval and returned it to Fielding. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been borrowing expensive gowns and other merchandise since 1982 without any disclosures, her spokeswoman had acknowledged. But Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said these clothes have been returned. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s transactions during 1981 were reported subsequently on a gifts attachment to the disclosure form the president filed late in May 1982. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> on Monday denied that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has kept any of the expensive items, although she said the first lady `` regrets that she failed to heed'' Fielding's advice to report the transactions anyhow. At his news briefing Tuesday, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was peppered with questions. When asked what the president thought about the story, he replied that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> considers it `` a cheap political shot against the first lady.''

<HEAD>Court Dismisses Lawmakers' Claim on War Powers Act in Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court dismissed a claim by 110 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should have invoked the 1983 War Powers Resolution when <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships were sent to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last year, the court said Tuesday. A three-judge panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war had rendered the war-powers issue moot. The ruling was made by <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judges </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> in a brief order filed Monday and made public Tuesday. The panel had been asked to review a lower court's dismissal last year of the lawsuit on the ground that it presented a political question upon which judges can not rule. The appeals court, however, dismissed the case without deciding that question. The issue in the case filed by Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, D-Wash., and 109 colleagues was whether President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should have notified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> within 48 hours of sending <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships to escort reflagged <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last year The 1983 War Powers Resolution requires the president, in the absence of a declaration of war, to notify <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> whenever <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces are sent into hostilities. The lawmakers claimed they were denied participation in the warmaking process because <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not submit notice. Under the resolution, the president must withdraw forces within 60 days absent a declaration or war or seek an extension from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` can claim no present injury as a result of their reduced ability to participate in a process which has been completed,'' the court said. `` Appellants' assertion of continuing injury is thus logically dependent upon their ability to demonstrate that hostilities are currently present or imminent. That demonstration can not be made,'' the court said. One of the plaintiffs, Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>, D-Ore., said the court's decision `` was a disaster for the War Powers Resolution and the Constitution. `` Future presidents will have no hesitation -LRB- to ignore -RRB- the clear requirements of this law. ... As of today, the War Powers Resolution is n't worth the paper it was printed on,'' he said in a statement. The court had asked both sides to file briefs on how the cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> affected the case. Lawmakers argued in their brief that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces still faced imminent hostilities because the cease-fire between the two countries is unstable. But the court said the court could not decide the merits of that claim because it `` would require an inquiry into the likely intentions of the Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> governments'' that is `` beyond the judicial competence.''

<HEAD>Peyote Use OK in Indian Ceremonies, Court Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The use of the hallucinogenic drug peyote in American Indian religious ceremonies is protected by the First Amendment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Tuesday. The ruling concerns two former <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> drug counselors who were fired and denied jobless benefits for using the drug during American Indian religious ceremonies. Peyote is a cactus that contains mescaline, an illegal hallucinogenic drug. The drug long has been used in ceremonies of the American Indian church, even though peyote possession is a felony. Tuesday's ruling echoed the court's 1986 decision in which it said denying jobless benefits to <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Galen </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> violated their constitutional rights to freely practice religion. Attorney <PERSON> Suanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovendahl </PERSON> said the ruling `` puts the <ORGANIZATION> Native </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on equal footing with majority religions in this country.'' `` This case shows our constitutional system does work and it does protect people who are out of the mainstream,'' <PERSON> Lovendahl </PERSON> said. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> said the state has n't decided whether to seek further court review of the case. However, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> expressed concern the ruling would set a precedent. `` Clearly, if some forms of drug use must be permitted under the constitution because they are religiously motivated, -LRB- the courts -RRB- are going to have to deal with other claims of religious exemptions,'' he said. The case had earlier reached the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which sent it back to the state court for a definitive ruling on whether peyote could be legally used in religious ceremonies in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. In arguments before the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, the attorney general's office said the state has constitutional authority to impose a ban on all uses of peyote. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in Tuesday's decision, noted that <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> laws against the possession of controlled substances, including peyote, `` make no exception for the sacramental use of peyote.'' At the same time, the court said that the `` outright prohibition of good faith religious use of peyote by adult members of the <ORGANIZATION> Native </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> would violate the First Amendment directly and as interpreted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.''

<HEAD>Guardian Recommends Approval of Settlement in Ford Estate Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A retired judge appointed to look after the financial interests of minor and unborn heirs to <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s estate has recommended approval of a proposed settlement. Retired <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, acting as guardian ad litem for four minor grandchildren and unborn grandchildren and great-grandchildren, said the proposed settlement protects their financial interests. He recommended Circuit Judge <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudnick </PERSON> approve the settlement. <PERSON> Rudnick </PERSON>'s ruling on the proposed settlement was delayed Sept. 26 when an attorney representing the grandchildren suggested appointment of such a guardian. All attorneys involved were pleased with <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>'s recommendation. `` I anticipated that he would approve it and I'm delighted that he did,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, an attorney representing <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> DuRoss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, third wife and widow of the automotive heir. `` The real benefit is that now the trust can get on with the administration and not be bogged down in the sniping,'' said attorney <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, also representing Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rudnick </PERSON>'s ruling, expected in the next few days, should settle the widow's lawsuit challenging the administration of the trust. She and <ORGANIZATION> Edsel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> II, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s son by a previous marriage, had disagreed over how the money should be invested, which attorney would be counsel for the trust, and whether the trust should pay family friend <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> $ 1 million a year to manage the money as a third trustee. Specific terms of the settlement have not been disclosed, but Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s attorneys said she withdrew her objection to <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>'s payments under the settlement have n't been disclosed. Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> is entitled to receive a minimum of $ 1.5 million a year from the trust. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> died at age 70 on Sept. 29, 1987, in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. He filed his will, which contained little information, in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which was his legal residence. The family hoped to avoid a public airing of their dispute, but it erupted when Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> objected to the selection of <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, a former undersecretary of state.

 A man wearing a headband with anti-American slogans jumped from the fourth-floor window of a campus building Tuesday, and 400 students clashed with riot police in anti-government protests. Officials at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said the man wrapped himself in a large South Korean national flag, shouted slogans against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, and then jumped. They identified him as <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyong-ku </PERSON>, 32, a laborer and said he was hospitalized with two broken legs. Ritualistic suicide is often used by radical students and dissidents in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to dramatize their cause. Elsewhere in the capital, about 400 students from <LOCATION> Kyunghee </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Konkuk </ORGANIZATION> universities hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police and shouted demands for withdrawal of 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a defense treaty, witnesses said. They also demanded the arrest of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> for alleged corruption involving his seven-year administration. Police reported no arrests or injuries in the two clashes, each of which lasted more than one hour. Police used tear gas to keep the students from marching into the streets and fighting was confined to school gates, witnesses said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Radical students say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supported <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> in militarily putting down the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> revolt in 1980, the worst in modern South Korean history. In a separate incident, riot police moved in on blind protesters and arrested about 20 of their leaders Tuesday when the demonstrators, shouting `` Do n't take our jobs!'' tried to march in the city's center. Police beat several demonstrators over the shoulders with fists when they resisted arrest, witnesses said. Riot police with shields raised moved in front and alongside the 300 protesters after trying for more than four hours to persuade rally leaders to leave the middle of a 10-lane boulevard which runs through downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Most of the protesters were blind or visually impaired and carried walking canes. A spokesman said the protesters wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> to protect the jobs of masseur and masseuse, traditionally held by the blind in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> but now going to oriental herb doctors and sighted practitioners. The 8th International Paralympic Games for the disabled currently are being held in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and organizers said they timed the demonstration to call attention to the blind workers' plight. The spokesman spoke on the condition of not being identified, as did the witnesses.

Missing is the imperial air given the late American four-star general by the original sculpture. But this coastal village on <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION> island wanted to have the 10-foot-high statue back up in time for a ceremony Thursday marking the day when <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> led <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in liberating the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Oct. 20, 1944. World War II veterans already have begun arriving here. Four days earlier, vandals blasted apart the statue, which shows <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION>, flanked by Filipinos and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers, wading ashore on <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION>. Police suspect despoilers under the influence of alcohol or drugs may have been responsible, but do not rule out communist rebels as suspects. Laborers reinforced the statue's steel frame to minimize damage in case of a second attack. Dozens of former Japanese soldiers visited the site Tuesday, about 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Most of them posed for photographs in front of MacArthur's statue. Among the Americans in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> was Dr. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mescallado </PERSON>, 75, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a naturalized American of Filipino descent who served as a physician under <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> during the war. `` I think -LRB- the vandalism was -RRB- immoral,'' said <PERSON> Mescallado </PERSON>. `` Maybe -LRB- the vandals -RRB- did n't know that <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> liberated the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> ... They do n't know their history.''

<HEAD>Senate Affirms Support For Contras, Passes Montana Wilderness Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, warning that it might attempt to renew military aid to Nicaraguan rebel forces at a future date, voiced its moral support for the Contras on Tuesday and also formally embraced <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s movement toward democracy. The non-binding `` sense of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'' proposals were attached as amendments to an unrelated bill which designates 1.43 million acres of <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> land in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> as wilderness. Another amendment called upon <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to turn back efforts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to obtain millions of dollars worth of loans. The bill was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but it faces an uncertain future. It must still be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and that chamber may not finish work on it before the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns. The Contra amendment, endorsed on a 54-12 vote, supports unspecified `` continuing efforts to strengthen the internal democratic opposition and the independent media of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' It also calls for `` maintaining the Nicaraguan freedom fighters as one of the few ` pressure points' on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> by providing the resistance urgently needed humanitarian assistance.'' The proposal was offered by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., who said, `` we need to send a message, not only to the resistance in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but to people throughout the world. White House officials and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers have said prospects are nil for obtaining a $ 16.5 million cache of weapons for the rebels in the waning days of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The dwindling Contra forces are subsisting on $ 27 million in food, clothing and medical supplies approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month as part of a Pentagon money bill. They have received no weaponry from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since February, when lethal aid was suspended. The mood in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> remains strongly opposed to sending new military aid. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has approved a complicated process permitting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to request the release of the $ 16.5 million in weapons, if certain conditions were met. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said last week he might call the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> into special session to vote for the aid, should the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> strike hard against the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas before the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convenes next January. The plan approved Tuesday endorsed that view. It warns that Nicaraguan failure to comply with <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace accords `` will inevitably cause the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve additional military assistance for the Nicaraguan resistance.'' Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Wyo., complained about the amendment `` Anybody can send a message ... What I think we ought to send is military support. I do n't think we ought to kid ourselves, this resolution is n't much.'' The Chilean proposal was sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, and was added to the Contra measure on a voice vote. He noted the Oct. 5 vote to reject a new presidetial term for Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the military leader who has ruled the nation since a 1973 coup overthrew the socialist civilian president, <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. `` We've have a long night of despair in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, from the coup in 1973 to until this year,'' said <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>. `` It's incumbent on us to support the Chilean people, to support this election they had, to say that we are going to work with them in this restoration of full democracy.'' Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, complained that the proposal was `` a feel-good amendment'' and said <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> had saved <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> from going communist. Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, R-Idaho sponsored the Soviet loan amendment, which was approved 64-2. The Soviets are trying to secure loans of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars through third nations, <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> said. `` The Soviets are using the eagerness of the western allies to play one nation off against another, to get them to compete with each other for the opportunity to donate hard currency to finance socialist economic failures and Soviet foreign policy,'' he said. The wildneress bill affects more than 6 million acres of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and is the result of a compromise worked out among competiting interests, including conservationists and the timber and lumber industries. The bill designates about 1.43 million acres of <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> land as wilderness, 360,000 acres as special management areas, and another 20,000 acres as federal study areas. It also releases for non-wildnerness uses more than 10 million acres in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s 10 national forests.

<HEAD>Iraq Offers POW Exchange `Unrelated' To Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has agreed to send home all Iranian prisoners of war if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reciprocates, and an Iranian diplomat said Tuesday he saw no reason why the exchange could not proceed. But <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the POW exchange would be unrelated to other issues in the U.N.-sponsored peace talks between the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> neighbors that went to war in September 1980. An <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> diplomat said his government's proposal would apply to all prisoners of war if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepts the plan. An Iranian envoy noted both nations had exchanged sick and wounded POWs previously on a humanitarian basis, and said similar repatriation could begin for the remaining prisoners. Both diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which has sought the exchange, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has 50,182 POWs and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> 19,284. But <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials and Iraqi and Iranian diplomats place the figures much higher, with many of the prisoners not registered. They estimate <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is holding from 60,000-70 ,000 POWs and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> 30,000-50 <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter given Monday to Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is ready to begin the POW exchange. But he added: `` Since the exchange of prisoners is a humanitarian matter ... our agreement on this step is unrelated to the other issues referred to'' in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agenda for peace talks. Security Council Resolution 598 called for an immediate cease-fire, withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized boundries and an exchange of prisoners. If the exchange occurs, it could help end a deadlock in the peace talks that have not gone beyond acceptance of the cease-fire that began Aug. 20 and the opening of negotiations five days later. A senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official close to the discussions told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that although <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the exchange would be unrelated to the talks, the offer represented an advance in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s position A major issue is the dispute over control of the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway that forms the southern border between the two countries. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nizzar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdoun </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was setting unacceptable conditions by insisting that both countries follow a 1975 treaty that placed the border down the middle of the Shatt-al-Arab. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wants the border to be drawnl along the Iranian shorline and has said the treaty is not valid. `` The Iranian position ... is an attempt to pressure <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to relinquish its political and legal rights while the two sides are discussing purely technical issues,'' <PERSON> Hamdoun </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali-Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, said Monday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan but with the condition that the 1975 treaty is upheld. Negotiations are to resume next week in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.

 Stock prices rallied in late trading Tuesday, pushing the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to its highest point since the market crashed last Oct. 19. The market's best known barometer jumped 19.38 points to close at 2,159.85, surpassing the previous post-crash high of 2,158.96 set on Oct. 10. But that was still 21 percent below the all-time peak of 2,722.42 reached on Aug. 25, 1987. Tuesday's trading volume was moderate, and most of the action centered around the issues of several big food companies that are involved in takeover fights.

 <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s dusty paths became trails of death where an an estimated 260,000 refugees, mostly children, starved or died in the gunfire of a civil war this year, Western relief officials said Tuesday. Among the victims were 180,000 children fleeing the war with their parents, and about 95,000 could have been saved by simple medical help such as vaccination, said Cole Dodge, <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> representative of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> child-welfare organization <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>. The relief officials said most of the quarter-million people died during long treks northward toward <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> or eastward into <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in search of safety. The officials said the refugees, of whom one in five died, suffered from lack of food or medical care after they left their home villages. `` You have to notice that exceptionally large numbers of people, affected by an accumulation of the effects of five years of war, left their homes this year. Deaths in other years have been much lower,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION>. Up to 2 million people have fled their homes in the southern battle zone since the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, led by U.S.-educated renegade army Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, took up arms against the government in 1983. The rebels, who are mostly Christian or animist <ORGANIZATION> Dinka </ORGANIZATION> tribesmen, are fighting the government dominated by Arab-descended Moslems. <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON> said dimished farming and commerce in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> since the war began have contributed to conditions that led to the high number of deaths in 1988. `` The result is staggering: 260,000 estimated deaths. And that's a conservative estimate,'' said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity <PERSON> Haj </PERSON> <PERSON> Tayeb </PERSON>, acting commissioner of relief, said Western agencies have exaggerated the casualties. However, he said the government has no estimates on the numbers of civilians who died or were made homeless in the war. An army spokesman, who requested anonymity, said there also were no official estimates of government or rebel battlefield casualties. Western relief figures show that in 1988, 700,000 southerners walked to the northern capital of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, 150,000 to the southern town of <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, 300,000 to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and 150,000 to the regions of <LOCATION> Kordofan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Darfur </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wannop </PERSON>, representative of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Development Program, said relief organizations must distribute the food cautiously so that it does n't fall into the hands of the rebels. The government in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> has accused some agencies of supporting the guerrillas and has expelled several organizations. The guerrillas say they control more than 90 percent of the southern countryside, but the government says it controls the main towns. The towns are restricted to most Western relief agencies, making it difficult to assess conditions there. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> announced last week it was beginning a $ 1 million airlift to <LOCATION> Abyei </LOCATION>, a refugee town of about 35,000 just north of the war zone. An estimated 3,000 residents starved or died of diseases during the summer. Up to 10,000 people were estimated to have died in the southern <LOCATION> Kordofan </LOCATION> area near <LOCATION> Abyei </LOCATION>. Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agency also was trying to charter aircraft for a relief mission to the rebel-besieged town of <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION> in the heart of the war zone. An estimated 6,000 civilians and an undetermined number of troops were reported stranded there with almost no food or supplies. But the sources said the American agency was having trouble chartering a plane, since insurance rates have soared because of rebel threats to shoot down relief planes. Another problem was obtaining military approval for the flights, the sources said. A military spokesman who asked not to be identified charged that some non-governmental Western relief organizations provide aid mainly to the rebels. A <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 was shot at on takeoff from <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION> airport Monday in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and one engine was hit, but the plane flew back to <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> on three engines and landed safely, informed sources said. The sources, speaking in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday they did not know who did the shooting or how many people were on the plane, which mainly carries relief supplies to <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Equatoria </LOCATION> region.

 The government announced Tuesday that talks with the opposition have been delayed until after Oct. 24, and urged its partners in the dialogue to disavow `` extreme elements'' before the talks begin. The outlawed Solidarity labor federation replied it was ready to begin talks immediately and blamed the government for the delay. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> strongly criticized anti-communist banners and slogans during a street protest in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Sunday and asked participants in the discussions to disassociate themselves from the protesters. Urban denied that the government was losing its will to enter the talks or putting new conditions on the discussions, which are to cover such questions as relegalizing Solidarity and economic and political pluralism. `` There are justified fears that not all the partners of the round table are being led by the same intention,'' he said. Urban said talks originally due to start Monday were delayed because church representatives who will take part wo n't return from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> until Oct. 24 and because of remaining disagreements over who will participate. `` It's difficult to talk with those who are shouting that they want to hang communists,'' said Urban. `` In this situation, the constructive, pro-reformatory opposition has to make its decision. Either it will be willing to seek agreement, against the extreme wing, or it will get linked with the extreme elements.'' Solidarity denied any extremism on its side. `` Solidarity, by the fact that it seeks relegalization, obviously is ready to act as a legal union which accepts the constitution, and all the people participating in these talks will share the same view,'' Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said the opposition has been ready since Monday to begin. He said further delay could raise questions about the government's desire for dialogue and prolongs an `` atmosphere of hopelessness'' that he said led to the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> episode. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> originally agreed to the talks on Aug. 31. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> then brought a halt to nationwide strikes that were <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest since 1981. While refusing to give a likely date for convening the round table, Urban said officials would like discussions to begin between Oct. 24 and the Nov. 2 visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. He said the atmosphere for the talks was made worse by the Sunday march by about 700 youths in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> that ended with youths throwing rocks at riot police. Official state publications and television gave heavy coverage to the incident. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said a prosecutor was investigating. Urban said that among slogans chanted were `` Communists will hang on trees instead of leaves!'' and `` Better the coffin than the commune!'' `` I think that the organizers of this demonstration were striving for torpedoing the agreement -LRB- for talks -RRB- and for overturning the round table,'' he said. But Solidarity spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Madajska-Krasowska </PERSON> on Sunday said Solidarity activists tried to persuade the demonstrators to disperse. The youths left only after police with water cannon arrived, she said. Urban said Tuesday that `` a problem'' remained with the proposed participation of longtime Solidarity advisers <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>. `` Gen. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s offer ... said that all who stand on the ground of socialism and the constitutional order can sit at this table,'' Urban said. `` It's difficult for <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> to fit into this category.'' The Roman Catholic Church expressed concern Tuesday night that job guarantees given workers who ended strikes in August and September were violated. The episcopate secretariat, representing <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops nationwide, said it sent a letter Monday to <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> reminding him of the guarantees of personal and employment security for strikers. Coal miners in southern <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> and steel workers in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> complained that strikers lost their jobs or suffered other reprisals, the secretariat reported. In another announcement, <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said that Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> plans to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this week in his first trip abroad as head of government. Urban did not give an exact date.

 A 21-year-old man has been charged with threatening Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s life by allegedly sending a letter bragging that the writer could have shot the Republican presidential candidate at a rally. The unsigned letter, which was sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>, included three photos of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> taken as he spoke at the rally here Sept. 27. The writer claimed to have been within 50 yards of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> while carrying a concealed .45 - caliber `` I could have easily pulled the pistol out and killed him where he was,'' the writer said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION> appeared Tuesday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> on two counts _ threatening to take the life of the vice president or inflict bodily harm on him, and sending a threatening letter through the mail, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>.

 Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> unleashed a snarling attack Tuesday on the Republicans for running a campaign that has turned the presidential election `` into a carnival sideshow of nonsense and negativism.'' `` We have witnessed, through the combined efforts of the Republican party and their image makers and their nominees for president and vice president, one of the most outrageous displays of negative campaigning ever seen in the history of national politics,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running made said in a speech before more than a thousand students in a <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> auditorium. They were attending a forum on public service sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga. `` The idea of citizenship, in fact, the very idea of self-government itself, is under attack,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said `` And there is no greater violation of that trust than to turn a great national election into a carnival sideshow of nonsense and negativism.'' `` What has happened _ almost without notice _ is an utterly vicious assault of distortion and character assassination'' directed at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said. `` They do n't seem to mind what they say is untrue,'' he said. `` They do n't seem to mind if it's misleading. They do n't seem to care that what they do is downright mean. If it sounds good, say it. If it sells, package it. If it looks good, nominate it.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the Democrats have at times been slow to respond to the charges. `` But I do n't think we ever imagined that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Republicans would be so willing to debase that precious currency of our democracy.'' The Democrats have `` taken a beating from the pundits and the pollsters'' who have `` pointed to an open casket in the ground and virtually invited us to jump in.'' But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who had been promisng a `` give -'em hell'' campaign for days, said, `` We've got three weeks to go, there's a lot of work ahead, and there's no time for mourning because we intend to win <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement that he believed in public service, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> philosophy preaches contempt for government and `` get while the getting's good.'' `` They do n't believe in much of anything at all when it comes to public service because they have nothing but disdain for the role government can play in the life of this nation,'' he said. `` They do n't understand the need for strong, ethical boundaries between public service and private gain,'' he said. Following the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> forum, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> visited a <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> aerospace plant in nearby <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, the conservative chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> blasted the Republican assertion that the Democrats would cut defense, recalling former <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>'s remark that to tell when the opposition was lying, watch for when they `` move their lips.'' And then <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> emerged from a mock-up of a space station to deliver a stump speech on defense and the space program. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was traveling next to a rally in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, completing a sweep of the three biggest <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> media markets in one day. Tuesday morning, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told local elected officials meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would pursue a much needed change in the nation's trade and economic relations with its allies. `` We're not going to become hewers of wood and carriers of water for the rest of the world. That's not our idea of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the League of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Cities convention <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the Republican administration has failed to promote <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade, and has led the nation further and further into debt to foreign countries. `` Many years ago, the famous pitcher, <PERSON> Satchel </PERSON> <PERSON> Paige </PERSON>, coined the phrase: ` Do n't look back _ somebody might be gaining on you,' `` he said. The need, he said, was for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to `` work harder and smarter than the competition.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said, had proven `` an ability to attract and sustain high technology industries.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must continue its role in protecting its allies militarily. But, he said, it was time for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to start paying their fair share of the cost.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> factions argued Tuesday about ethnic and social strife straining the fragile Yugoslav union but the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> ajourned for the night without making any major announcements. The session ended without a vote on personnel changes. The <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the meeting would resume Wednesday morning. Early Wednesday editions of the official newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> said many of the 200,000 Serbs in troubled <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province were dissatisfied with the `` fruitless and marathon discussions'' by <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members and planned a protest rally Thursday in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, the provincial capital. The committee is expected to make major personnel and policy changes in efforts to quiet demands for dismissal of leaders blamed in public protests for the nation's worst economic crisis since World War II. Ten members of the 23-man ruling Politburo, including national party chief <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, face a secret vote of confidence in the 162-member Central Committee. Four Politburo members are not involved in the vote because they already have promised to resign. Nine are exempt because they hold their seats as party leaders of the armed forces and of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics and two autonomous provinces. One of those exempt from the vote is <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, the populist party leader of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. His is the largest republic and the two autonomous provinces, <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, are part of it. His campaign for greater Serbian control over the provinces has split the national party leadership, pitting him against politicians who fear his standing with the people will rise at their expense. Serbs have rallied by the hundreds of thousands in recent weeks to express anger at alleged harassment of the Slavic minority by the huge ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> majority in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> region, the ancient Serbian heartland adjacent to <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. At a time of growing economic hardship, <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> has found broad sympathy for his demand that sweeping leadership changes be made. Inflation is running at an annual rate of 217 percent, causing real wages to plummet, and the foreign debt currently stands at $ 21 billion. Austerity measures imposed in May have inspired strikes and protests by workers, whose average monthly wage is the equivalent of less than $ 100. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has not had strong leadership since President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> died in 1980. Each republic and autonomous province has its own government and party structure. <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> put the decentralized system and collective federal presidency in his 1974 constitution to prevent one republic from gaining sway, but the result has been ineffective government by compromise. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s activities have put him in open conflict with <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON>, party chief in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, a liberal, Western-oriented northern republic. <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Greganovic </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s official youth union, indirectly attacked <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> on Tuesday. `` Those leaders who are putting themselves at the head of discontented masses behave as if they were gifts from God,'' he said. `` They behave as if they did not come to power with the leaders they now attack mercilessly.'' <PERSON> Raif </PERSON> <PERSON> Dizdarevic </PERSON>, current head of the nine-member collective federal presidency, seemed to rebuke both <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> in backing <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>'s call for party unity. `` The lack of unity in the leadership, multiplying of late, is a great danger for the country,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We need accord to unite in fighting problems, without imposing some kind of hegemony over one another,'' said <PERSON> Dizdarevic </PERSON>, who threatened nine days ago to impose `` emergency measures'' if unrest continued. He did not specify the measures. In <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, a government plan to relax austerity measures for workers in profitable firms and social services foundered because deputies said proposed salary increases were too small. The International Monetary Fund, which insisted on the austerity program introduced in May, was said to have approved easing the rules for some workers.

 Seven striking elementary school teachers were arrested Tuesday when they tried to block a van carrying substitutes from entering the school. Second-grade teacher <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Foore </PERSON> said police arrested her and six other women and put them in a police van after they draped a 30-foot-long banner across a driveway to the Memorial Elementary School in this <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> suburb in northeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The banner said `` Kids Count _ Teachers On Strike For Class Size.'' The teachers were charged with disorderly conduct and released, she said. The arrests came after the <ORGANIZATION> Barberton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> rejected the school board's latest contract offer at a meeting Sunday night. The association represents 285 teachers that struck the 4,600-student system on Oct. 3. Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Barberton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the women were arrested Tuesday morning after they refused to move away from the front of the van. He identified the six other women as <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFarland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maxie </PERSON> <PERSON> Muckleroy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Fickert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Daverey </PERSON>. `` It was very scary, most of us have never had a parking or traffic ticket before,'' Ms. <PERSON> Foore </PERSON> said. `` Elementary teachers are normally very meek and very mild and very passive. I would do it again. It's not the money, it's the class size.'' Police said Ms. <PERSON> MacFarland </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Foore </PERSON> were also arrested Monday and charged with disorderly conduct after they tried to block a van carrying substitute teachers to the same school. Ms. <PERSON> Foore </PERSON> said those arrested are scheduled to appear in <ORGANIZATION> Barberton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on misdemeanor charges Oct. 24. Superintendent <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemmer </PERSON> said the board has offered pay raises of 4.9 percent, 4 percent and 4.5 percent over three years. <PERSON> Violet </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, president of the association, said the teachers want a two-year contract with 5 percent raises, improved health benefits and class size limited to a maximum of 30 students.

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators announced approval Tuesday of an experimental plan for coordinated trading halts _ or circuit breakers _ in stock and futures markets during steep price dives. The plan, proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, provides for a one-hour trading halt across markets when the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks plunges by 250 points or more from the previous day's closing. It calls for a two-hour halt when the Dow falls by 400 points. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the stock markets, and the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees futures exchanges, approved the one-year experiment on the eve of the first anniversary of the Oct. 19, 1987 stock crash. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's largest stock market and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is the largest market for trading stock index futures. Other markets, including the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>' over-the-counter system, are joining in the plan. Government approval is effective immediately. It is up to the exchanges to decide when the circuit breaker plan begins. `` We're ready to implement this as soon as Thursday,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` We think this is a very significant action to remedy what problems there were in the market a year ago.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> did not give a specific start time, but said it would be `` very soon.'' The plan is designed to provide an orderly halt to trading before one market _ stock or futures _ breaks down, shifting all of the trading to the remaining market. It also is intended to allow time for buyers to step in and counter overwhelming sell orders. During the 1987 crash, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> plunged a record 508 points, wiping out $ 500 billion in paper wealth in a single day. Another part of the program gives individual investors, as opposed to pension and mutual funds, preference in trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> when the Dow moves either up or down by 25 points. The rule applies to orders of 2,099 shares and smaller. After the crash, many individual investors complained that their orders were shunted aside, in some cases for hours, while larger buy and sell orders from institutional investors were executed. The market halt plan is one of the key recommendations offered after the crash by a presidential task force headed by <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banker who is now <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> did not offer a specific proposal, but said some sort of `` circuit breaker'' was needed to derail a crash. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this month that it was going along with the plan only reluctantly because it did not want to be the only market left open when all others were closed. But, <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON> argued that a pre-announced trigger for market halts could act as a `` magnet,'' pulling the market down faster. As the market approaches the trading halt limit, it could be flooded with orders from traders fearful they will be prevented from selling, he said. With the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> approval, which is effective immediately, a previous six-month experiment to curb computerized index arbitrage ends. The earlier program had imposed a so-called 50-point collar on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. When the market moved by 50 points or more, index arbitrage orders were not allowed through the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s automated trading system Index arbitrage is a form of trading designed to take advantage of momentary price discrepancies between the stocks and futures markets. It involves the buying and selling of massive orders on stocks and futures markets and was criticized for making last year's crash more precipitous. However, the collar experiment ran counter to the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> commission's finding that stock and future markets were in effect one market and that disconnecting them could be dangerous. A new rule taking the place of the collar is designed to provide more orderly index arbitrage. When the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poors </ORGANIZATION> 500 index falls by more than 12 points _ the equivalent of 96 points on the Dow _ index arbitrage orders will be shunted into a side file of the trading computer. If buy and sell orders can be matched, the trades will go through. If not, trading in individual S & amp; P 500 stocks could be halted.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday that with inspiration from <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> he would `` campaign as an underdog'' until Election Day, despite polls showing he has widened his lead over Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` No votes can be taken for granted and I'm not taking any votes for granted,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an audience at <ORGANIZATION> Westminister </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Westminster was the scene of <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s famous 1946 speech declaring that a postwar `` Iron Curtain'' of secrecy and self-imposed isolation had surrounded the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the communist Eastern bloc. `` Churchill was right,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, although few Americans wanted to hear his message at the time. Several dozen protesters demonstrated outside the hall where the vice president spoke. One carried a sign reading, `` Bush Is No Churchill,'' echoing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s assertion that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` a rusting curtain'' separates East and West today, but that `` in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and other parts of the world, we have yet to see the full promise of Soviet change turn into change itself.'' If elected president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, he would remain wary of Soviet intentions, even though the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is more enlightened than before. `` Now is not the time to abandon realism about what moves the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mentioned <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> for the former prime minister's speech on March 5, 1946, in connection with his own election campaign. <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> had suffered many setbacks and rebounds from oblivion during his long, tempestuous career in British politics, and <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> scored a stunning upset when he defeated <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>, the heavily favored <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate, in the 1948 presidential election. `` Those two men offer a very personal lesson for me. They knew the ups and downs of political life like few others. They knew that political opinion polls can be very misleading. And they knew that no vote could be taken for granted,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Paraphrasing baseball great <PERSON> Yogi </PERSON> <PERSON> Berra </PERSON>, the vice president said both <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> `` knew that no election was over until it was really over.'' `` There are undecided voters out there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The race is close in many states,'' including <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, he said. As he left his hotel for the Westminster speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked how he could call himself an underdog when a new <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll gave him a 17-point lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We're not going to lighten up,'' he replied. `` We're going to stay right down to the wire. ... If I find anybody letting up in my campaign, they're history.'' Asked how he could expect people to believe he was fighting like an underdog, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` Watch my smile and watch me work. Watch how fast we go and where we go. We're not letting up. The worst thing to do would be to show a complacency I do n't feel or an overconfidence that I do not feel.'' In his speech 42 years ago, <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> said that `` from <LOCATION> Stettin </LOCATION> in the Baltic to <LOCATION> Trieste </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION>, an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` We and our allies did not prevent the Iron Curtain from shutting out the light to the East. But we did secure peace and freedom for the West.'' He said his campaign theme of `` peace through strength'' was modeled after <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s world view. On an otherwise light campaign day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used his official <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two jet plane as a backdrop in taping a campaign film, and attended a rally attended by more than 3,000 people at <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. `` I have a feeling it's going to be tough for the liberals next month,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said to the wildly cheering crowd. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said a new campaign commercial ridiculing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' ride in an Army battle tank began airing Tuesday in several areas around the country `` This is no time to train somebody in how to meet with the Russians,'' says the ad, which uses news footage of a helmeted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> standing in the turret of an M-1 tank. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is expected to intensify its TV commercials dramatically in the final three weeks of the contest. Aides said the vice president would hammer away at proven campaign themes such as U.S.-Soviet relations, space and defense. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to make a campaign swing Wednesday through <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> toured all day Tuesday, before he returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the first time in eight days.

<HEAD>Argentina Offers Talks Without Preconditions On Falklands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Argentine Foreign Minister <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> said Tuesday his government is ready to talk to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> about the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> without preconditions, dropping its insistence that sovereignty must be on any agenda. <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>'s Channel 4 in a broadcast interview pre-recorded in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> that he believes the time is right to start a dialogue between <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The two countries have had no diplomatic relations since the 74-day Falklands War in 1982, won by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` I think there is a little light at the end of the tunnel,'' <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> said. `` I think that we have enough common history, both countries, and if we start a dialogue _ without preconditions _ just the dialogue, this is going to be very important.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government has repeatedly stated its willingness to talk with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> on ways to mend relations, but has refused to discuss Falklands sovereignty with <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. A July 1984 meeting between British and Argentine government officials at <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, broke down over Argentine insistence that Falklands sovereignty should be on the agenda. A Foreign Office statement Tuesday night reiterated <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s refusal to discuss sovereignty over the islands, which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has ruled since 1833 and which <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> claims as an inheritance from the days of Spanish colonial rule An Argentine invasion of the islands touched off the Falklands War. `` The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government is determined to seek more normal relations with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and uphold its commitment to the Falkland islanders,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said, referring to the 1,900 mostly British-descended residents who have repeatedly stated their desire to remain British. `` Sovereignty is not for discussion,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. `` If <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> genuinely wishes to improve relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, she could do so by responding to the large number of British proposals already on President -LRB- <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s table.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> have held indirect talks through the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on some issues. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has said it wants to discuss trade, air links and fishing with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON>, currently president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, was asked if he meant <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> would be prepared for talks without discussing sovereignty. `` I'm saying without preconditions,'' he replied. `` This is a very precise formula, without preconditions. No preconditions from our side, no preconditions from their side.'' <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> said he hopes the talks will be held before <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> leaves office in December 1989. In an accompanying report on next May's presidential election, Channel 4 asked <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> about <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON>'s proposal for talks without preconditions. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate, is leading <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in the polls. `` Sovereignty has got to be on the table,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said. `` Otherwise, there's no point in talking. I do n't have any problem negotiating with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as long as she knows that the islands' sovereignty is ours.''

 A 15-minute piece of music that the arranger said was reconstructed from <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s last work was warmly applauded at its premiere Tuesday night but an occasional discordant note came later from the audience. The work, presented at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, is described as the first movement of what would have been <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s 10th symphony. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he spent five years piecing together symphonic fragments found in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> after the German composer's death 161 years ago. `` The sketches struck me as being particularly good, even by <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s standards,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday as the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> rehearsed for the premiere. `` Even though my completion wo n't be as good as <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>, I think the overall result has got enough really good <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> in it to make it very well worth hearing.'' Violinist Sir <PERSON> Yehudi </PERSON> <PERSON> Menuhin </PERSON>, who conducted the second half of the concert but not the movement, said: `` I think it is a valuable work. It is certainly <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>.'' Some purists disagreed. `` Calling this <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s 10h was a bad idea,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dankworth </PERSON>, a classically trained jazz composer. `` It should be named ` Excerpts and Snippets.''' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>, who described himself as a music lover, said, `` I thought it was marvelous fun, though I doubt <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> would have followed the Ninth with anything like that.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who wrote a book on <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s creative process while working on the musical reconstruction, said <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s plans to finish the final symphony were mentioned in a letter written eight days before his death in 1827. `` He actually offered it to the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'' of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said, `` And now they've got it, or as much as there is of it.'' Speaking as a white bust of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> solemnly peered over the rehearsing musicians, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> called his work `` a chance for other people to get some idea of what <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> had in mind. Knowing what the 10th symphony is like has increased our knowledge.'' The music ranges from whispery quiet sections to bold, soaring themes over its 15 minutes. <PERSON> Menuhin </PERSON>, after hearing the music for the first time at the rehearsal, said it was `` a very beautiful work.'' The 71-year-old musician called the controversy over the premiere `` rather silly.'' `` Everyone is eaten with curiosity,'' he said. Asked if the work was important, <PERSON> Menuhin </PERSON> said: `` They use the word ` important' for all kinds of sales of antiques and ` important' gold coins I think it's at least as important as that.'' Conductor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> called the piece `` very, very interesting.'' `` It sounds like a very young, powerful <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>,'' he said after the practice session. `` Not the Beethoven you can hear in a slow moment of the Ninth -LRB- Symphony -RRB-, the <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> with one leg in another world. This is a powerful one.'' However, <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> said, he could tell which parts are the real <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>, and where <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> filled in the blanks. According to <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, two-thirds of the work was taken directly from <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s sketches, which sometimes were nothing more than a single line of notes. `` There's something of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> in every bar,'' he said. `` You ca n't say <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> stops here and <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> starts there. In practically every bar, it's part <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> and part me.'' Orchestra members were taking the <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> brouhaha in stride. First cellist <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucknall </PERSON> said the movement `` is certainly <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>. We have n't heard this piece of music before, so of course it's important.'' `` I do n't think it's the best <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> we've ever heard,'' said violist <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Creech </PERSON>, `` but obviously it is very exciting.''

 Eleven Soviet inspectors watched Tuesday as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel using handheld power saws began the historic destruction of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> cruise missiles under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Led by Army Major Gen. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, the Soviets arrived at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base to watch 41 ground-launched cruise missiles, 41 protective canisters for the mobile weapons and seven transporter erector launchers be cut in half over the next few days. `` The INF treaty is one of the most critical steps in the direction of ending the Cold War,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said after the destruction started. `` What we saw today was a critical step in that direction.'' The Soviets, who flew from <ORGANIZATION> Travis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> aboard an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-141 Starlifter, were met by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation headed by Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` What we saw today should generate more confidence and predictability in our relations,'' <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> told reporters after the first missile was destroyed. The destruction started with several <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> personnel cutting into a missile and an aluminum canister with handheld power saws. The missile was a 21-foot device built in 1986 by the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, flight-tested at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Dougway Proving Ground in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and deployed at an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> station in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> before being shipped to Davis-Monthan in February Soviet inspectors and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel sat on nearby bleachers as they watched the work, which produced loud noise and acrid smells as the saws cut through into metal. Fire extinguishers were positioned near the workers. Also slated for destruction was a 56-foot, 78,000-pound launcher. Nuclear warheads, fuel and guidance-related equipment have been removed from each weapon, and the warheads have been returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, which stores <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nuclear weapons, said Capt. <PERSON> Kendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> OSIA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Soviet inspectors have made two previous visits to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the treaty, once in July and again in August. They are being escorted during their stay by 22 officials from Davis-Monthan and the <ORGANIZATION> OSIA </ORGANIZATION>. A total of 443 intermediate-range cruise missiles deployed in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are scheduled for destruction, all within the first three years of the treaty. Signed last December by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the treaty also calls for elimination of 169 shorter-range Pershing I-A and 234 Pershing II intermediate-range missiles that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has deployed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The treaty requires elimination of all land-based nuclear missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles. The cruise missiles have a range of about 1,500 miles. The warheads are not included in the destruction process, which <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said specifies lengthwise cuts through the missiles and cutting the launchers in half. `` The treaty does not eliminate the warheads,'' <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said. `` It eliminates the ability to deliver the warheads.'' He said implementation of the treaty is `` a confidence builder on both sides, and an important first step.'' Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said destruction of the equipment should be completed within about 72 hours. The inspectors were to wear protective eye gear and ear plugs and would remain within the 600-by-300-foot fenced compound at the <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maintenance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regeneration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The compound houses missiles, canisters and launchers stockpiled for destruction. `` When you have four rescue saws going, it's worse than going to the dentist,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said 58 Pershing missile stages were eliminated between Sept. 8 and Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Longhorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Karnack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The Army is destroying at least some of the Pershings by burning their engines. The Pershings each have two stages, and their launchers will be eliminated beginning this week in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. As of Friday, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had eliminated 277 missiles under the treaty, which specifies destruction of 1,846 missiles of several types: SS-20, SS-23, SS-12, SSC-X-4, SS-4 and SS-5. The INF treaty is the first to allow on-site inspection and is viewed as a trial for the proposed Stategic Arms Reduction Treaty. That pact would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent and call for more intricate verification procedures.

 Americans of low and moderate incomes are more generous with their financial contributions and time than their upper income counterparts, according to a Gallup poll released Tuesday. `` Contrary to popular opinion, the well-to-do in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can not be described as generous,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, president of the Independent Sector, a coalition of 650 corporate, foundation and volunteer organizations that commissioned the survey by the Gallup Organization. `` Giving and volunteering in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a stark contrast between heart warming generosity and bone chilling selfishness,'' he said, noting the results of the in-home interviews conducted last March with 2,775 Americans 18 years and older. <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> told a news conference that contributing households with incomes below $ 10,000 gave an average of 2.8 percent of their incomes to charity, while families between $ 10,000 and $ 30,000 gave 2.5 percent. Those with incomes between $ 50,000 and $ 75,000 gave 1.5 percent; families earning $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 donated 1.7 percent, and those with incomes over $ 100,000 gave 2.1 percent. Overall, the survey said seven out of 10 households in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> contributed an average of $ 790 to charitable organizations, with 45 percent volunteering an average of 4.7 hours a week in time to causes and organizations in 1987. Independent Sector said the margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. These figures translate into 80 million people giving a total of 19.5 billion hours with a dollar value of time contributed at $ 150 billion, <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, head of the group's `` Give Five'' campaign to increase volunteerism, said the latest study showed it was possible to reach the organization's goal of motivating Americans to donate at least 5 percent of their incomes and five hours a week to the causes of their choice. <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, who also serves as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the findings confirm the need for the ` Give Five' campaign to estabish a basic standard of what we owe to our communities.'' <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgkinson </PERSON>, the Independent Sector's vice president for research, said the poll's finding that giving decreases as income increases had been missed in previous Gallup surveys which measured only the amount given without regard to what percentage of income the donated amount represented. <PERSON> Hodgkinson </PERSON> said the results indicated that a typical generous American household was a moderate income family of five living in the rural <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> that volunteers and belongs to a church. The least generous profile was a single, affluent individual living in a central city in the South who does not volunteer or attend church, she said. These rankings were formulated by evaluating results of averages for weekly volunteerism, income and the percentages of family members who were volunteers, she said. Using this, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> was first, with volunteers donating 2.5 hours of their time and 1.5 percent of their income, followed by the West, 2.4 hours, 1.5 percent of income; the East, 2.0 hours, 1.2 percent of income; and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, 1.8 hours, 1.7 percent of income. Although those questioned in the South gave a greater percentage of their earnings to charity, <PERSON> Hodgkinson </PERSON> said this group had a low proportion of households with a volunteer and an overall lower number of volunteers in the general population. Community rankings, using the same criteria, showed rural areas volunteered 2.4 hours and contributed 1.8 percent of income; followed by suburban, 2.2 hours, 1.5 of income; and central city, 2.0 hours, 1.3 percent income. Married people gave 2.5 hours a week and donated 1.5 percent of their incomes, compared with singles who gave 2.0 hours a week and only 0.5 percent of their incomes. Those with three or more children give 2.7 hours a week and donated 2.0 percent of their income. The study also indicated the importance of religion in volunteerism, with 79 percent of church members contributing funds and 51 percent volunteering their time, compared with 55 percent of non-church goers giving donations and 33 percent volunteering.

 The <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ruby </LOCATION>, a royal red gem that weighs 48 carats, was supposed to sell for a record $ 15 million at auction Tuesday. It did n't. Instead, a high bid of $ 7.6 million was rejected as insufficient by the gem's owner, and the ruby _ which <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier called the centerpiece of `` the most important jewelry sale ever held in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' _ was taken off the block. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction house announced that the largest diamond ever auctioned to the public would be offered at a sale Wednesday. The 407.48-carat gem is second in size only to the 530.20-carat Cullinan I, which is set in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sceptre </ORGANIZATION> as part of the Crown Jewels. `` I'm certain this jewel will set a record price for a single precious stone,'' said <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Curiel </PERSON>, head of <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jewelry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He refused to estimate the price. The record auction price for any jewel $ 9.31 million, the amount paid in April 19 for an 85.91-carat white diamond at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. The diamond, currently owned by two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> jewelry dealers and a jewelry retail chain in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, was purchased as an uncut 890-carat stone in August 1984 but has since been cut into a flawless stone. At <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auction house Tuesday, about 300 people strained their necks to catch a glimpse of those who put up the multimillion-dollar bids for the <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ruby </LOCATION>. But the auctioneer's gavel slammed down a short time later to end the bidding without a sale. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s spokeswoman, said the identity of the ruby's seller would not be revealed. `` Obviously, we're disappointed,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s jewelry department. `` This was expected to bring a record and it did n't. It was such an enormous price we were trying to get. On unique objects, it's very hard to put a price on it. Sometimes it does n't work.'' The ruby was offered in the same session as the Star of Sierra Leone Diamond No. 2, which was sold for $ 3.52 million Tuesday. The diamond is one of 11 stones cut from a 969-carat diamond discovered in the west African nation in 1972. Several <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ruby </LOCATION> bidders, who asked not to be identified, suggested that perhaps extensive pre-sale publicity about the ruby had backfired on <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. In its pre-auction report, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> had given the Mandalay a glowing review. `` The combination of pleasant shape and proportions, fine color, transparency and luminosity, make it an exceptional gemstone,'' said a report released by the auction house. Block described the <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ruby </LOCATION> as `` the largest faceted gem known'' and estimated it would command about $ 15 million. The record price for a ruby is $ 1.9 million, paid at a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> auction in July for a 10.4-carat stone. The Mandalay Ruby is framed by 18 diamonds within a gold-and-platinum broach mounting. Small, diamond-set fleur-de-lys designs decorate the corners. The <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ruby </LOCATION>, named after the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> city near which it was mined, was brought to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1875. `` It is questionable if the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market would ever have seen -LRB- the gem -RRB- but for the necessities of the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government,'' wrote <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>, a contemporary gem expert. `` In <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, the sale ... created intense excitement; a military escort was considered necessary to escort the persons carrying the parcel to the vessel.'' The gem was sold at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in 1896. `` The buyer was reputed to be an important Indian gem connoisseur acting on behalf of a royal Indian family,'' according to a note by gem expert <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> printed in the catalog for Tuesday's sale.

The bill would impose stiff fines aimed at making the dumping prohibitively expensive, and use penalty fees to pay for alternatives. `` Today's action means that ocean dumpers have to find alternatives to using the sea as the world's biggest garbage pail, or face fines and penalties,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, a principal sponsor of the legislation. The measure reconciles differing sludge-dumping bills passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in August and by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote on the compromise could come as soon as Wednesday, with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> then expected to sign the bill. Some 8 million tons of sludge a year are dumped by the nine agencies at a site about 106 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> closed a site just 12 miles offshore in 1987. The new bill would require dumpers to pay fees of $ 100 dollars per ton of sludge beginning next Jan. 1. Dumpers, meanwhile, would be required to negotiate with federal authorities on individual timetables for ending their dumping. Those agencies that can not strike a deal would pay fees that rise from $ 100 a ton to $ 200 a ton by the end of 1991. Any authority still dumping sludge in the ocean by the start of 1992 would have to pay penalties in addition to the fees. Those fines would begin at $ 600 per ton and rise by 11 percent a year for continuing violators, rising to total tens of millions of dollars. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> originally banned ocean sludge dumping as of 1981, but that deadline was suspended in a successful lawsuit by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The original deadline was set in a 1978 law, after which some 300 industries and 100 municipalities stopped dumping. The proposed ban initially was opposed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials, who complained that the deadline would be impossible to meet. But the opposition weakened as a bipartisan coalition of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> lawmakers rallied in favor of a ban.

 The General Assembly on Tuesday voted to accept <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s credentials by the widest margin in the six years since <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states have been making demands to disqualify the Jewish state. In an annual vote on membership in the 159-member world body, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was accepted by a vote of 95 to 41 with seven abstentions and 16 nations absent. That was 15 votes better than last year, when the vote was 80-39 with 10 abstentions. For the past six years during the credentials vote, an Arab nation has urged acceptance of all countries except <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Each year a Nordic country has proposed the Arab amendment be rejected. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s acting ambassador, <PERSON> Johanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bein </PERSON>, called the vote Tuesday `` an impressive and very significant victory. `` In the six years in which we have had this annual ritual we see from year to year a gradual improvement,'' he said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been condemned by many <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members for its harsh measures in putting down the 10-month Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied territories. Increasingly, however, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and its members are calling for an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> involving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and all parties to the dispute. Among the changes in voting this year were <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which voted `` yes'' to accept <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s credentials. Last year, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was absent. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which last year voted against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, this year was absent, in a tentative signal of warming intentions. Other countries who switched from `` no'' votes or absences to `` yes'' votes were <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. Two new `` no'' votes came from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which last year were absent. In July, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> severed its administrative ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and distanced itself as a player in a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement. The Israeli Mission spokesman, <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON> <PERSON> Binah </PERSON>, attributed the improved vote to an atmosphere of international reconciliation, better East-West ties, greater pragmatism at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and the increasing prestige of the world body.

 Opposition deputies on Tuesday urged the improvement of equipment on Italian runways following the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Uganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner while trying to land at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s main airport in heavy fog. Thirty-one of 52 people aboard were killed in the disaster early Monday, which occurred when the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 swept in low from the sea, struck two houses and trees and smashed into a field a few hundred yards from a runway which lacked sophisticated landing guidance equipment. Investigation of the crash revolved around a number of questions raised by airport officials and pilots: _ Did the pilot miscalculate the altitude or angle of descent _ Did the altimeter, the instrument that measures altitude, fail _ Did the pilot misunderstand instructions from air traffic controllers or receive bad advice _ Did a bank of fog suddenly roll across the runway, robbing the pilot's vision <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>'s transport minister arrived in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Tuesday to join an investigation led by the <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. A separate investigation will be conducted by Italian magistrates. Crucial to the probe will be tapes of cockpit-tower conversations and an examination of the `` black box'' instrument recordings found by rescuers. <PERSON> Stefano </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusconi </PERSON>, who directs the technical division of the Italian pilots' union, said on state television that other airlines had decided to divert flights late Sunday night from the fog-bound <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> da Vinci airport. He also noted that the runway the Ugandan pilot was aiming for is one of two runways at the airport without the Instrument Landing System, which gives pilots information about their altitude. Four of the main runways are equipped with the system. Three Communist Party parliamentary deputies appealed to the transport and interior ministries for `` immediate administrative measures'' to ensure that all runways in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> have the landing guidance euipment. <PERSON> Rusconi </PERSON> said Italian pilots have complained frequently about Italian airports that do n't have the most up-to-date devices. Hospitals treating survivors reported that at least two of the 21 injured victims were in serious condition. One was identified as <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Komukyeya </PERSON>, described as a Ugandan princess from Toro, a former kingdom in western <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. Among those reported in good condition was 8-month-old <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gait </PERSON> and his parents, <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, of Bath, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, who escaped from the burning plane with minor injuries. The British Embassy in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> identified two Britons among the dead as <PERSON> Manjeet </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhillon </PERSON>, who also held <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> citizenship, and <PERSON> Kara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON>, a native of <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Their ages were not available. Among the dead were six Ugandan members of the flight crew, including the pilot and co-pilot. By late Tuesday, neither the airline nor Ugandan government officials in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> had released a list of the dead.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reduced the sentence of former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Clodomiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Almeyda </PERSON>, allowing the Socialist politician to be freed after 15 months' political imprisonment. Opposition parties called for <PERSON> Almeyda </PERSON>'s release last week, saying it would represent a good-will gesture by President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> lost a plebiscite two weeks ago on extending his rule to 1997, and the triumphant opposition is pressing for democratic reforms it says are needed for a transition to elected civilian rule. As <PERSON> Almeyda </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> prison to the applause and cheers of about 100 supporters, he declared his `` decision to join the struggle of the Chilean people to recover full democracy.'' <PERSON> Almeyda </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION>, a five-party alliance, was sentenced to 541 days for violating internal security laws by making anti-government statements. The court cut that sentence to 390 days, less than the time already served. <PERSON> Almeyda </PERSON>, 65, was foreign minister under Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, whose elected government was toppled by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in a 1973 military coup. He served briefly as acting president during a trip abroad by <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, who died in the takeover. Imprisoned after the coup and later expelled, <PERSON> Almeyda </PERSON> disregarded an official ban on his return and re-entered <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in March 1987. He was quickly jailed and senteced to three months internal exile in a small southern town. After that exile ended in June, a federal court convicted him of `` apology of violence,'' stemming from his verbal attacks on the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> government, and sentenced him to prison. Last December, he was politically banned for 10 years for allegedly violating a constitutional article banning pro-Marxist statements and propaganda. With <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s plebiscite defeat, an open presidential election is due to take place in December 1989.

<HEAD>Begin Fuel Loading At Nuclear Power Plant Amid Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fuel was loaded into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s first nuclear power plant Tuesday while congressmen argued about canceling the project amid the shouts of nuclear foes in the Chamber of Deputies. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has entered the nuclear age,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electricity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday afternoon after the loading had started. Commission spokesman <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Femat </PERSON> said between a third and a fourth of 92 tons of enriched uranium was put into the first reactor unit Tuesday. The second unit of the U.S.-designed <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> plant on the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> state is still under construction. <PERSON> Femat </PERSON> said loading could be completed in two or three days. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 180 miles east of the plant, about 400 people crowded the public gallery of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and shouted `` Laguna Verde No!'' during a congressional debate on the project. Most opposition parties are against the nuclear program that has been a favored project of ruling <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- administrations for the past 20 years. The government calls the project proof of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s technical ability. Although the plant is U.S.-designed much of the construction has been done by Mexican firms. The commission said the <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> reactor would not begin commercial operation until it has operated `` at 100 percent efficiency for 100 continuous hours.'' The government has said the tests could take six months. There have been protests near the plant and in the cities of <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Xalapa </LOCATION>, the state capital, since the government announced Friday that fuel loading would begin within 10-25 days. Many parents in <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sola </LOCATION>, a town only five miles from the plant, kept their children out of school to protest the decision, the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Excelsior </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Anti-nuclear groups have urged the government to reconsider its decision and vowed to continue their protests. They claim the plant is obsolete and dangerous and question the need for nuclear power in oil-rich <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbala </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> congressman and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, has accused the critics of distorting the facts and spreading misinformation.

The <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> plant has been under construction since 1973.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said Tuesday he is fighting for his life in his defense against a $ 52 million lawsuit accusing him, his wife and a former aide of mismanaging the ministry he left in disgrace. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s work for the ministry, with its television programs and <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> religious theme park, was praised in court by a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board, who said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> deserved his high salary and every bonus he received. And the evangelist's former financial secretary testified that he reimbursed the ministry for personal expenses that were paid for out of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> funds. During a lunch break at the trial in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said of the case, `` It may be business as usual for everyone else, but this is my life I'm talking about.'' He called it `` literally a trial for my life.'' In the first week of the trial, held last month, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s current managers presented testimony and evidence that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> received millions of dollars in bonuses and salaries. The ministry went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, seeking protection from creditors while it reorganized, in June 1987, three months after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in a sex-and-hush-money scandal. In testimony Tuesday, pastor <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said that she and other <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board members consistently voted unanimously in favor of bonuses for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. `` If a bonus came up, I voted for it,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, who was on the board from November 1985 to March 1987, when the board resigned. According to <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> figures presented in court, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> received $ 278,000 in salaries in the fiscal year ending in May 1987, plus an additional $ 1,167,000 in bonuses in that year. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was to testify Tuesday but that was postponed a day to allow him time to review canceled checks and reimbursement vouchers that were supplied to his attorneys Monday. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he was `` a touch angry'' that he was only now receiving information he needs to defend himself, and hinted at intentional sabotage. `` I think somebody calculated they would hold all the materials until the middle of the trial,'' he said, though he did not say who. And he predicted his research would satisfy at least 90 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>'s concerns. Also testifying Tuesday was independent financial analyst <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s finances from 1978 to 1986 showed it to be a healthy, growing ministry without financial problems. According to <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the ministry's fixed assets grew at an annual compound rate of 28 percent during that time while revenues increased 19 percent. Under cross-examination by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> could not recall the precise salary of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> during her time on the board. `` Everything you can get your hands on would be fair?'' Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> asked Ms. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> about <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s compensation. Ms. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> denied that. Also testifying was <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s former financial secretary, who said her job was to keep his personal expenses separate from the ministry's money. She said she routinely wrote reimbursement checks to the ministry for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s expenses. But she said former <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, also a defendant, frequently received cash advances for himself and <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> for which she never saw documentation. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> told her he kept that documentation at home, she said. An <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent also testified he found cash advances to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> that apparently served no legitimate business purpose.

 A debt-ridden committee formed to promote <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> as home of the original Lone Ranger narrator on radio is about to ride into the sunset without erecting a hoped-for statue in a city park. The committee had sought to erect a statue of <PERSON> Brace </PERSON> <PERSON> Beemer </PERSON>, the original Lone Ranger radio show narrator and the fourth voice of the Lone Ranger in the 1940s, but fell far short of the $ 75,000 that would have been needed for the monument, committee members said.

A $ 2,000 printing bill is still unpaid, she said. The committee has already repaid $ 20,000 in debts, committee members said. In its first year, the group spared no expense in its promotion of the city, about 35 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, as home of the Lone Ranger. The committee sponsored a Super Week, held in conjunction with the Super Bowl, which was played in <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> on Jan. 24, 1982. `` We threw a three-day party like this town has never seen _ and never will again,'' <PERSON> Wassil </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> granted election-year benefits to one of the nation's largest interest groups Tuesday when it approved bills elevating the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> department and granting veterans the right to have courts review VA denial of benefits. Both measures were approved on voice votes. The measure creating the new Cabinet department now goes to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is expected to sign it, while the judicial review plan must be returned to the House for approval. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also passed on a voice vote a bill granting a series of cost-of-living increases in a variety of VA payments. The House has yet to act on its version of that legislation. The Department of Veterans Affairs would be the 14th Cabinet seat and the fifth created since 1960. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill by voice vote Oct. 6. Backers of the change said the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> already has the fifth-largest budget among federal agencies and giving it Cabinet status will assure that the money is spent properly. The VA, with an annual budget of $ 30 billion, serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors. It will pay out about $ 14 billion this year in income maintenance and $ 626 million for education and rehabilitation assistance in the current fiscal year. The agency and its 240,000 employees administer about 90,000 patient beds in 534 health facilities and <LOCATION> VA </LOCATION> doctors will see about 20 million outpatients this year. It runs 109 national cemeteries and will bury 300,000 veterans in the next 12 months. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, switching the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> to a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> department will cost $ 33 million over five years. Most of that will be spent on changing signs on VA buildings. The second major piece of legislation gives veterans, for the first time in 170 years, the right to ask federal courts to review VA denials of benefits. The bill creates a new `` <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>,'' and abolishes the current <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. That panel is part of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> and is now the last resort of veterans who are unhappy with decisions to reject their claims. The measure also eliminates a Civil War-era law which limits attorney's fees for veterans' claims to $ 10 per claim. That made it difficult for veterans to hire lawyers other than those provided by the VA.. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called the measure a `` historic advance in veterans' rights The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved somewhat similar legislation on Oct. 3 by a 400-0 vote, but there were minor differences between that proposal and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> package. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill will now be returned to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for another vote. The benefits increase legislation provides that 2.2 million veterans with service-connected disabilities and 310,000 widows and orphans will receive the same cost-of-living increases paid to Social Security recipients. The House is expected to pass its own version, which would provide a specific 4.1 percent increase, according to <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` will undoubtedly concur'' with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposal, he predicted. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> added an amendment which could provide interim health care payments to some of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange, a highly toxic defoliant used by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The measure provides a `` presumption of service connection,'' under which the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> would assume that two types of cancer _ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma _ were caused by Agent Orange. Veterans could receive benefits while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, which has n't finally agreed that Agent Orange caused cancers, studies the problem. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, said Agent Orange provisions will have `` a very limited effect. `` I find it highly disturbing that those people who went to fight the VC -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> spend too much time fighting the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> back here in this country,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. Before passage, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved, 47-15, an amendment to permit the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> to offer Vietnam-era veterans flight training courses under the auspices of the GI bill. Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, D-S.D., the sponsor, said airline deregulation has created vacancies among pilots and there will be thousands of pilot jobs to be filled in the next decade. But critics said the program was offered on a trial basis in past years and had n't worked.

<HEAD>Animal Shelter and Giant Sequoias Out of Immediate Fire Danger</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Wildfires were slowed Tuesday by lower temperatures and diminished winds after burning more than 7,300 acres and an exotic animal refuge and ancient Sequoia trees were put out of immediate danger. The good news came after nearly 2,000 firefighters attacked two big blazes with water-dropping helicopters and ground crews that cut fire lines around the threatened animals and trees. The Divide fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> had burned 4,110 acres by Tuesday but stopped advancing toward the Wildlife Waystation, a shelter for 1,000 exotic animals that have been abandoned or wandered into neighborhoods. `` It's still a long-range threat,'' cautioned <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` It looks like we have survived this one well. We've made it,'' said <PERSON> Martine </PERSON> <PERSON> Colett </PERSON>, owner of the shelter. `` My face is a picture of wonderfulness.'' The lions, tigers, giraffes, jaguars, horses, alligators and other animals housed at the shelter became agitated as smoke and ashes surrounded the area and airplanes buzzed overhead, but they calmed down Tuesday as the fire slowed, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Colett </PERSON> praised the firefighters, who worked to clear an area around the shelter and set a backfire to burn brush down the mountain toward the fire, she said. The fire, started by a 10-year-old boy playing with matches, burned in inaccessible mountain terrain and was 50 percent contained Tuesday with full containment expected Wednesday evening. Two of the 1,030 firefighters battling the blaze suffered minor injuries. In the Sequoia National Forest 125 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, lower temperatures of 70 degrees and winds 3 to 10 mph aided firefighters battling a 1,900-acre brushfire that threatened 2,700-year-old Sequoia trees in the 3-square-mile Giant Forest. Firefighters quickly extinguished a flare-up Tuesday morning near the grove of trees which are considered the largest living things on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Although the trees were out of immediate danger, the threat remained. The fire, which officials believe was started by a careless camper or smoker, was 20 percent contained Tuesday but no estimate was given on full containment. Four of the 930 firefighters on the blaze suffered minor injuries.

 Right-wing Christian legislators boycotted a voting session that was to elect a new speaker of parliament Tuesday, and a lawmaker said his colleagues were `` dancing on the grave'' of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The failure to elect a successor to <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem whose one-year term ended Sunday, sparked a new feud between Christians and Moslems. In the absence of the 39-member quorum required to extend <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>'s term or elect a new speaker, the 26 Moslem deputies who showed up for the voting session declared <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> a caretaker speaker until a successor can be elected. The Christian deputies countered by issuing a statement rejecting <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a staunch ally of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and naming their own speaker pro tempore _ <PERSON> Kazem </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>, 88, the eldest deputy among the 76 members of parliament. `` This is the fatal blow,'' said <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>, a Western-oriented Shiite who lives in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` We're actually dancing on the grave in which we have buried <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has been without a head of state since President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term ended Sept. 22 and no successor was elected because parliament could not gather the necessary quorum. Two rival governments, one Moslem and one Christian, have since emerged, splitting the army and security forces along religious lines. Newly arrived U.S. Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> made his first visit to the Foreign Ministry Tuesday, apparently to smooth tensions after he was criticized by the ministry's director general, <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Abil-Lamaa </PERSON>, for not presenting his credentials to the Christian government of army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. `` I came to see the director-general to discuss basically the general state of relations between <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting at the building in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> took up his post Sept. 24, two days after the expiration of <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term. He has been meeting almost daily with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem leaders. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> has declared he will present his credentials only to the newly elected president, not to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Cabinet or the rival government of incumbent Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem. When the Moslem deputies arrived for the 11 a.m. session at the Parliament in Syrian-policed west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, sniper fire crackled overhead and some of the men were seen ducking for cover as they approached the building in the devastated city center. Police said the bullets probably were fired by Christian militiamen hiding in battle-scarred apartment buildings nearby. `` -LRB- The naming of <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> as caretaker speaker -RRB- is essential to preserve the integrity of the legislative authority, especially at a time when the top executive post remains vacant,'' the Moslem legislators said. The Christians justified their boycott of Tuesday's session by declaring the area near <LOCATION> Parliament </LOCATION> unsafe. They demanded the session be shifted to <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON>, a two-story building near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line that has served as temporary headquarters for the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> since 1976. The Christians boycotted three previous Parliament sessions called for Aug. 18, Sept. 22 and Sept. 23 to elect a successor to <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. Minutes before he bowed out 26 days ago, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, named <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, then army commander and also a Maronite, prime minister of a caretaker military Cabinet. But Moslems claimed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment violated an unwritten national agreement dating to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, under which the president has always been a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni and the speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> a Shiite. The Moslems pledged allegiance to the incumbent Cabinet of Sunni Moslem Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>.

 Critics accused the foreign secretary of deceiving his people for signing a new agreement o <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases, but President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said the pact enhances Philippine-U.S. relations. The accord, signed Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, allows the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to use six military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> until 1991. `` He has sold out his country and grossly deceived his people,'' the national <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION> daily said of <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>. `` For these treasonous acts, he ought never to show his face again in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>.'' Critics said the accord could prompt even stronger opposition to <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller garrisons. `` The general perception is that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> got the short end of the deal, and this perception is expected to be exploited by the anti-bases bloc to further fan the wave of anti-Americanism in the country,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Capino </PERSON> in Wednesday's issue of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. Under the agreement, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will pay the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> $ 962 million a year for the use of the bases. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> had demanded $ 1.2 billion a year. `` We asked for 12 boxes of delicious apples, they gave us four small bags of peanuts,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>. He called the payment `` a publicly unacceptable compensation package certainly strengthens the hand of those who are batting for no extension after 1991.'' Senators on Tuesday debated whether the pact required their approval in accordance with a constitutional provision on international agreements, but were unable to resolve the issue and postponed discussion to a later date. `` I think many people, even those who are pro-bases, were disappointed by the outcome so that would even help our cause,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Wigberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanada </PERSON>, a leading opponent of the bases and principal sponsor of a senate bill banning the presence of nuclear arms in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The pact allows the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to maintain its policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons in aircraft and ships visiting the bases. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy was upheld, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said a constitutional ban on nuclear weapons on <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> territory `` is being implemented,'' since the storage of such arms here requires government consent. The Philippine constitution, approved in 1987, adopts a policy of freedom from nuclear weapons `` consistent with the national interest.'' Legal experts say the phrase falls short of an outright ban. `` The agreement reaffirms the enduring bilateral relationship between our respective countries and allows us to proceed to improve other aspects in that relationship,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said in a statement. Communist guerillas, whose demand for the removal of the bases has fanned a 20-year-old rebellion, accused the goverment of `` shamelessly selling out'' Philippine sovereignty. `` We call on the Filipino people to reject this new agreement and hold President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> accountable for this act of high treason,'' the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The accord ends a nearly seven-month review of the 1947 agreement governing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, which are the largest in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Alfonsin Sets May 14 Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> on Tuesday called national elections for May 14 and hailed in advance what he termed `` a singular accomplishment'' in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> _ the peaceful handing over of political power. `` On Dec. 10, 1989, 61 years since the last time it happened, I will hand over the sash and cane -LRB- Argentine symbols of office -RRB- to the president who will succeed me in the honorable task of leading Argentines on the unstoppable path to progress and greatness,'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said. In 1928, <PERSON> Hipolito </PERSON> <PERSON> Yrigoyen </PERSON> won national elections and replaced President <PERSON> Marcelo </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvear </PERSON>. Two years later <PERSON> Yrigoyen </PERSON> was toppled by a military coup. Since Gen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> completed his first term in 1952, no Argentine president has finished the traditional six years in office. A military coup ousted <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> in 1955 and the party that carries his name was banned for the next 18 years. `` This is a victory for democracy,'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said in a seven-minute speech taped at Government House and broadcast nationwide at 9 p.m. `` We will complete the triumph of today in the ballot boxes.'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Nosiglia </PERSON> announced last month that elections would be held in May. No exact date was set until <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s speech. The two main political parties already have begun campaigning. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, the presidential candidate of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s centrist <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, began his campaign on Sept. 30 with a multicity tour. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> started his campaign Saturday night. About 75,000 Peronists gathered Monday in the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plate </LOCATION> soccer stadium to celebrate the anniversary of <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>'s release from prison in 1945 _ a pivotal event in Argentine history. <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> went on to dominate Argentine politics for years. The third main candidate is <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> of the Union of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Both <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> and <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> are lawyers and provincial governors. <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> is an engineer, former economy minister and ex-ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Up for election are the presidency, vice presidency, many seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, and thousands of provincial mayors and local legislators. The main issue probably will be the economy. Gross national production has been stagnant for eight years and inflation has soared. The cost of living increased by 440 percent over the past 12 months. Public employees including doctors, railway engineers, teachers and mail carriers hold frequent strikes to press demands that wages keep pace with inflation. Polls indicate that <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, who promises wage increases and tax cuts, has a wide early lead over the more conservative <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>. The surveys gave <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> virtually no chance of victory. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s inauguration on Dec. 10, 1983, following elections that October, ended nearly eight years of right-wing military dictatorships. An attorney and human rights leader, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> has defended his political record by stressing that whatever he did took place in a democracy. `` In stable democracies, this occurrence -LRB- an election -RRB- is routine,'' said <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> on Tuesday, dressed in a dark suit and seated at an ornate desk. `` In our country, which is subject to shocks and disasters, it is a singular accomplishment. `` I have been an actor in a historic episode, but the authors, those ultimately responsible, are each and every Argentine. None should be indifferent to the jubilation ... and true national celebration.''

 The stage is a medieval dungeon with furniture and costumes that could have come from a seedy <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> antique shop. Plexiglas panels separate the actors from the audience, forcing the performers to wear body microphones so they can be heard. One cast member, sporting a black beret festooned with tiny pink roses, resembles a prancing <PERSON> Che </PERSON> <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON> masquerading as <PERSON> Isadora </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>. A second performer dresses in what looks like a nurse's uniform _ only she's wearing patent leather shoes topped with little black bows A third actor wears red pajamas and a red stocking cap. He's the hero of the piece, or at least the performer with the most lines. It's hard to learn anything about these people in `` What Did He See?'' _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s latest exercise in avant-garde incomprehensibility that opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. The three-character play lasts one hour. It seems like more, especially if you attempt to decipher what the author is trying to say. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> should know, since he wrote, directed and designed the production. It's theatergoers who are left in the dark. In interviews, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> has described the play as being about the dangers of retirement or the lure of idleness. You'll have to take him at his word. The evening is mostly a series of independent statements. For example, the pajama-clad hero announces, `` I have to tell the truth. I no longer function as a normal human being.'' He's right The actors work hard at seeming to believe all they have to say. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, best known as the villain in the film thriller `` No Way Out,'' projects what appears to be an appropriate air of desperation. <PERSON> Lili </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisto </PERSON> are his mysterious sidekicks, the people who alternately support or berate him, depending on the whims of the playwright. Their dedication is admirable. The title of the play asks `` What Did He See?'' It poses a murky question that can only have one answer _ not very much.

 The Communist-led <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s largest union, launched its `` Day of Action'' Tuesday with marches in all major cities and strikes that disruped public services. The one-day walkout was to support demands for an increase in the minimum monthly wage from $ 758 to $ 968. The confederation also is asking for protection of purchasing power, more employment, better working conditions and retirement protection. Tuesday's strike hit hardest public transportation, the postal service and the state-run electricity company. But it is only a foretaste of more widespread strikes scheduled for Thursday by the other unions representing public employees. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Durafour </PERSON>, the civil service minister, has refused to consider any new pay increases for 1988. Talks between the government and the unions on 1989 salaries are to begin soon. Also joining the strike were employees at French diplomatic posts around the world, where staff are fighting a series of cuts in their cost-of-living allowments. It coincided with a nationwide strike by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s nurses and hospital employees who demand higher wages. The nurses want $ 325 a month more. The government has offered about $ 105, depending on experience and seniority. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, on a visit to <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION>, told a group of nurses that they were asking `` much too much,'' saying the government of Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> already had `` given a lot.'' The workers' demonstration in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> turned out 100,000 people, according to the union. Police estimated the crowd at 15,000 to 20,000. About 5,000 marched in <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>, each and smaller demonstrations were held in other cities. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> subway ran at about 50 percent to 70 percent of its normal service Tuesday, while service was normal in <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>. Long distrance rail lines were practically normal in most parts of the country, except for the west, where a third of the scheduled trains did not run. Hardest hit was the state-run electric company. Sporadic power cuts hit nearly all areas. The postal service also was heavily affected. Strikes in main sorting centers spelled delays of mail for the next several days.

 South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s proposal for ending four decades of rivalry and conflict with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is being praised by a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official as an `` imaginative and constructive policy of reconciliation and accommodation.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans in a few days to announce changes in American policy toward <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in a new effort to lower tension on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula going back to the 1950-53 Korean War, the official said Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is currently under review, in consultation with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and changes probably will be announced soon after <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s talks with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the White House Thursday, the official added. The source briefed reporters on Korean issues and the forthcoming Reagan-Roh meeting on condition he not be identified. `` Dramatic change'' should not be expected in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> because `` after all, we're talking about a state which we have officially characterized as terrorist,'' he said. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to take some steps `` which we hope will be in conformity with President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s desires and the desires of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people to ease the tensions on the peninsula and to create an atmosphere which will allow for a peaceful resolution of the differences that exist there,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> put <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on its list of terrorist countries in January, citing evidence that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> agents were responsible for blowing up a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jet near off <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> last November in which 115 people died. The move canceled an earlier relaxation of rules against informal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contacts with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> diplomats. The changes under discussion cover matters other than diplomatic contacts and trade, the source said, declining further details. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policymakers are not giving <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> veto power over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decisions, the official said. `` It's going to be our determination where we go and how far we go, but we're certainly not going to'' upset the close relations between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. The source said officials `` have no trouble at all'' with the idea of cross-recognition under which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would be formally recognized by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s allies, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other friends of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would recognize <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, puzzling forecasters with its unusual path through the southern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> Tuesday, unleashed floods in northern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> that left about 50 people dead, missing or injured, officials said. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> was headed toward the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> island resort of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION>, 500 miles north of the Colombian coast. On Monday, the storm buffeted northern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> with heavy rains and winds of 65 mph before heading north toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. In the northern Colombian town of <LOCATION> Carmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bolivar </LOCATION>, 360 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, at least three people were killed Monday and about 38 were missing, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> of the Bolivar state government said. A child also was killed and seven people injured Monday in the town of <LOCATION> Uribia </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Guajira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, police said in a communique. Government officials called foreign reports that 200 were killed in the town `` absolutely false.'' At 9 p.m. EDT <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> was centered near latitude 11.3 north, longitude 77.2 west, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said in a statement. It said the hurricane's center was about 310 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION> and 225 miles northeast of Colon, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> was moving westward between 5 and 10 mph and little change was expected overnight. Maximum sustained winds were near 95 mph, and satellite photographs indicated <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, the fifth hurricane of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> season, might be strengthening in the next day or two. A hurricane watch was in effect for the north coast of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Toro </LOCATION> and for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION>. Both <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were on a state of alert. The Costa Rican government evacuated homeless elderly people and children and 86 hospital patients from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Limon </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast port city of 8,000 people about 105 miles southeast of the capital, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said authorities were preparing to move another 30,000 coastal residents inland. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> predicted <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> would hit the coast around 6 a.m. Wednesday if it continued on its present course. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, civil defense authorities urged people to stay calm and broadcast emergency instructions on radio and television. Long lines formed at supermarkets and pharmacies in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as people heeded warnings to stock up on supplies. In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in a news release that about 200 homes in Carmen de Bolivar were destroyed or flooded. In <LOCATION> Uribia </LOCATION>, a town of 45,000, about 75 percent of the dwelings were destroyed or flooded, police said. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s unusual southern path had forecasters puzzling over its possible landfall. `` <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> is one of a kind,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center. `` You just do n't see many hurricanes that take this course and hug the coast.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, another meteorologist at the hurricane center, said there was strong potential for flash floods in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> comes ashore. <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said winds could be near 100 mph when it hits the coast and `` depending on how much populated area there is where the storm does hit land, there could be wind damage.'' Heavy rain began Tuesday morning in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Eladio </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON>, director of the country's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said there could be flooding on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast overnight. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where it had been raining for several days, officials were less certain. `` We ca n't say if the storm will directly affect <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at this moment,'' said <PERSON> Pilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. As a tropical storm with 45 mph winds, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> slowly built its strength as it skimmed <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s coast, baffling forecasters who had predicted it to weaken. It reached hurricane force Monday night when maximum sustained winds reached 74 mph and its center began to become better defined, a sign the system could intensify over open water into the western <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, forecasters said. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> became the 10th named storm of the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season when top winds passed 39 mph on Oct. 11. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, the most devastating hurricane in recent years, left more than 300 people dead and caused billions of dollars damage as it tore through <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> peninsula last month. The six-month hurricane season ends Nov. 30.

 <LOCATION> MIAMI </LOCATION> _ Three Cuban prisoners, jailed at least 20 years each for their political beliefs, arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday after they were released from a <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> prison. Dozens of family members waited expectantly at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to welcome the prisoners, <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazorra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Padron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvez </PERSON>, known as `` plantados'' for their resistance to political rehabilitation in <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> jails. `` Do n't cry, we're together ... finally, finally,'' <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON> told his mother as he embraced her. Moments before, family and friends formed a tight circle around him, hands touching his hair, clothes and face as an emotional <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON> walked across the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs Service lobby toward his parents. <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON>, 45, served 24 years of a 30-year sentence. He had n't seen his parents, <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Padro </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Delores </PERSON>, in 18 years. <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Padron </PERSON> were sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, 51, who was jailed for 24 years and came with his wife <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, daughter, son-in-law and their 2-year-old daughter, was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Reinaldo </PERSON>, a former plantado, arrived in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> last month after being imprisoned 24 years in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

 The condition of 87-year-old Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> apparently grew worse early Wednesday after he vomited blood in a health crisis that began a month ago. Palace spokesman <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said, however, that the emperor was resting and there was no need for concern, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. The palace said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> coughed up a small amount of blood around midnight Tuesday, followed by a discharge of blood from his bowels, and that doctors administered .42 pints in blood transfusions. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has discharged blood intermittently since Sept. 19, when an intestinal hemorrhage caused him to vomit a substantial amount of blood and confined him to intensive care. In one month he has received 20.2 pints in transfusions, according to news reports. Persistent news media reports have said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has cancer in the area of his upper intestine. The palace has refused to comment and asked news organizations to refrain from speculation that could dishearten the emperor. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s pulse was rising slowly and reached 101 by Wednesday morning, up from 94 a day earlier. He ran a slight fever of 99.1 degrees, <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> told a regular news briefing. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s normal temperature is about 95.9. Court physicians have unsuccessfully tried to combat his anemia with blood transfusions. In recent days they have allowed the world's oldest living monarch to take a few spoonfuls of weak porridge, and acknowledged he is losing strength because his intravenous feedings can not supply enough nutrients.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday rescued two men on a sailboat who gave food and water to a starving family adrift in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, then ran into trouble themselves, a spokesman said. The family was rescued last Thursday. The men aboard the Early Light called the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> for help Monday, saying their boat was disabled about 60 miles northwest of the Hawaiian island of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartvigsen </PERSON>. A C-130 search plane found the 33-foot vessel and directed the cutter <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cross </LOCATION> to the boat, <PERSON> Hartvigsen </PERSON> said. The Cape Cross reached the men around noon. <PERSON> Hartvigsen </PERSON> said the Early Light would be towed to <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>. The men, who were reported in good health, and their craft were expected to reach the island late Wednesday, 34 days after they left <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. When the men made their distress call, they said they had gone a day without food and water and that a storm had broken the boat's boom and torn its mainsail, <PERSON> Hartvigsen </PERSON> said `` They gave away most of their food and water, so they were in trouble out there,'' he said. `` But they were in radio contact with the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, so they knew they'd be rescued. It was just a matter of when.'' The men on Oct. 7 gave food, water and fishing gear to a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> man and his five sons who were adrift on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> for 33 days. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rescued the six Thursday 550 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Thursday. <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleishour </PERSON> and his five sons were lifted off their disabled sailboat, <PERSON> Paloma </PERSON>, after eight days without food and five days without water. <PERSON> Fleishour </PERSON> said Tuesday that the crew of the Early Light, whom he knew only as <PERSON> John </PERSON> and `` Stretch,'' gave him and his sons five gallons of water, a fish and some fishing equipment. The two boats planned to sail together, but the Early Light headed in a more westerly direction, he said. `` They were n't in any trouble at all when we saw them,'' Fleishour said. `` They said they had 100 gallons of water and lots of groceries on board. They seemed like they were in really good shape.'' Although the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> released few details about the Early Light, <PERSON> Fleishour </PERSON> said the crew told him they were headed from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Name of the TV Game: Getting It Free, Getting It Your Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have resorted to what the Republican calls `` silly things,'' from exchanging stares with the Three Little Pigs to riding an M-1 tank, to get the ultimate in exposure _ a free minute on the network news. The job of making that picture and sound bite irresistible to TV producers falls to image-makers for the two presidential candidates. These image-makers exert control over what gets seen on television by confining reporters and camera-sound crews to a twilight zone close enough for cameras but too far away for microphones to pick up any unscripted speech. The result often enough: pictures of flag-draped campaign rallies with the candidates offering snappy one-liners but no clear discussion of the issues. `` That's life,'' says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Salant </PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` Almost everything except natural disasters are done to a greater or lesser extent to draw the attention of the media.'' The influence of television in the political arena goes by the numbers: _ At this time of year, the three network newscasts reach more than 25 million American homes every night _ Deduct station breaks and commercials, and the three network newscasts have about 22 minutes to cover the world _ One minute during one network news show costs a commercial sponsor $ 90,000 Making that one-minute splash on all three news shows _ the campaigns call it `` free media'' _ is a windfall worth more than a quarter of a million dollars. To get their share of that limited time, campaigns must `` outguess the producer in terms of what's going to be important,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for television news coverage. `` What's new is the next logical step from the point of view of the campaign manager _ once you get your view in, how do you keep everything else out of it,'' he said. `` That's what the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has done, very effectively, and that's now what campaign managers are being judged on.'' The managers, especially the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> managers, are being judged in some quarters as entirely too effective. `` More than ever before, the whole campaign is in the control of image-makers,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Salant </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has many of the same advisers who worked with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, has used his status as a sitting vice president to produce some striking images in the campaign. He was shown witnessing the destruction of the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles under the treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and greeting the Discovery astronauts after the space shuttle landed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought to turn that around, unleashing a series of television commercials on `` The Packaging of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' The Democratic presidential candidate also has tried to use `` free media'' to his own advantage. Just this week, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> borrowed a trumpet and played a few bars of `` Happy Days are Here Again.'' It was a made-for-TV visual and sound bite, but one that may have backfired because it was coupled with reports showing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dropping in the polls. During a recent campaign stop in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged, `` We all do silly things in campaigns.'' `` I wish you could have been with me out there in <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I was standing there and these three little pigs kept staring at me, so I know what it is to be on the receiving end and do dumb things. ... `` But the one that takes the cake was him riding around in that tank, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in that tank,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' ride in an M-1 tank across a grassy field in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> on Sept. 13 was undertaken to respond to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charges that he was soft on defense. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, media adviser to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and now to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has said that the news is much more important than advertising in defining a candidate. It is <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>' job, and the job of his counterparts in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, to define the news. What happens when control is threatened? After the presidential candidates met in two debates with formats dictated by the two campaigns, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined an offer by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' for a free-for-all session with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Frankly, our campaign schedule requires the candidate to be on the road after the second debate, taking his message to the voters directly,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> explained. He did not mention the minimum of 5 million households that tune in nightly to `` Nightline.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mossbacher </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s finance chairman, has said that $ 30 million to $ 35 million of the campaign's funds will go for television advertising, the lion's share of the $ 54.4 million it is allowed to spend overall. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has said it plans a comparable TV blitz. `` It's nobody's fault, it's what's happening with the times,'' <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON>, professor of social psychology at <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said of the campaigns' heavy reliance on television. <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> says studies showed voters in the past chose a candidate by picking up information from speeches and then discussing it with others. `` I can remember growing up that people would sit around and argue politics, sitting on their porches or in bars,'' he said. Now, in a time when the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says the average viewer has the TV set on for 6 hours, 59 minutes per day and increasing numbers of families have more than one set, people do n't even discuss television shows with each other, <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> said. `` There has been a fragmentation of opinion-forming,'' he said. At the same time, the candidates are getting less time on the air. Voters used to hear half-hour and even one-hour political speeches on radio or television, said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>, a professor of communications at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> and author of `` Packaging the Presidency.'' By 1964, she said, 60-second spots became popular and now the 30-second spot is the norm. Network news executives believe long stories drive away audiences, she said, and that reinforces the public's expectation that it will get short stories. `` There has been more substance in this campaign than is clear to people who are watching the network news,'' <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, associate professor of government at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, says that suits voters, too. `` They have always been interested in brevity, and we have this romantic notion that at some point the voters were really actively involved in the process. They were n't,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> says. CBS correspondent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Schieffer </PERSON>, who has traveled with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, said `` I think we do have to resist a pretty picture every so often.'' <PERSON> Schieffer </PERSON> said he drew the line on Labor Day when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> set out to help load fish in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` I declined to use the pictures in my story because I thought it was silly, because I did n't think it had anything to do with his qualifications to be president,'' <PERSON> Schieffer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> said television still can help voters become deeply informed. The C-Span cable television channel runs unedited speeches by the presidential candidates most evenings, for example, and public television's MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour tackles issues in depth.

<HEAD>Extreme Views on the Economy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A seldom mentioned consequence of the spectacular collapse of securities markets one year ago today is that it seems to have made almost anything sound plausible. What, for example? Well, double digit inflation and interest rates, another market collapse to 500 points on the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average, depression _ or, if you prefer, the most stunningly strong economy you could ever imagine. People out there are peddling all those notions, and others, and many of them are considered investment advisers. No matter how their views might differ they share one belief in common: Fear sells. Consider this advertisement for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s International Gold Report: `` How to Cash in on the <ORGANIZATION> Dukakis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Let <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Make You a Millionaire.'' The thesis is that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his Cabinet member, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, would spend the nation into bankrupcty, leaving gold as the only sane way for people to make money or protect what they already have. What if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins? `` In either case _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar will hit the pits long before the economy goes thud. Bank on it. Inflation will settle in like lice on the body politic,'' the ad says. Adrian Day, publisher of <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>'s Investment Analyst, claims to be `` the man who made more money for more people than any investment adviser in history,'' but that's not the reason he is selling bad times. `` I'm not writing just to tell you what a great guy I am,'' he says, but to warn you `` that the next couple of years will be tougher, meaner and more treacherous than any period in the last two decades.'' On the anniversary of the great stock market crash it is n't only the market letter writers who are offering unusual views. Some large brokerage houses are, in effect and sometimes in words, declaring that we are now in a new era. The new era, it is suggested, calls for investments in sound values rather than in hot stocks, a long-term rather than a short-term view, reasonable expectations, a concern for fundamental values and the like. But a new era? The truth is that such concepts have never gone out of style, except in some areas of the securities community, they being fundamental to investing as opposed to trading. Economists also, but perhaps to a lesser extent, have had their thinking affected by the big collapse. Among some, there appears to have developed a competition to find where the economy's weak spots may be developing. As a result, falling unemployment and rising production repeatedly have been viewed with alarm. More recently, the recession-watchers have shifted to inventory buildups. And almost constantly, retail sales are watched for signs. Perhaps the zaniest fear of all is that expressed by those who view the anniversary of the 1987 crash, by itself, as somehow capable of stirring up another disaster. The economy, meanwhile, has performed as well as it possibly could, given the problems of budget and trade deficits. It has shown much more assurance, steadiness, restraint and sense of direction than have its observers. It suggests, oddly, that the peddlers of fear and the extreme thinkers may be doing some good. Conceivably, their reminders might have something to do with keeping the economy on the straight and narrow.

 <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who only stuffs basketball hoops from the bottom, was down in the schoolyard with baseball legend <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantle </PERSON>, sportscaster <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON> and midget slam-dunker <PERSON> Spud </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, playing stickball and basketball for the cameras. A perfect two days of work, he says, to make a video of his old hit, `` Me and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> Down by the Schoolyard.'' The song is one of 16 on a new retrospective released this week by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> called `` Negotiations and Love Songs.'' It is his first album since `` Graceland'' came out in 1986. As one of pop music's most respected songwriters, the Grammy-winning artist said he is n't repeating himself. `` I'm not doing something over but, on the other hand, I'm developing ideas I've had for a long time.'' In a recent interview at the Hit Factory studio, where he's working on a percussion-oriented album for release next summer, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> talked about the new LP He said he selected certain tunes to demonstrate the best example of his work over the last 15 years after splitting with <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON>. The songs appear in the order in which they came out on <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s solo records, starting with `` Mother and Child Reunion'' and `` Me and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>'' from his first solo LP, `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>,'' in 1972 `` I think it works better in terms of sound, the instrumentation and recording techniques,'' he said. `` I think it's less confusing to the ear than mixing them all up, in my case.'' He originally left out `` Kodachrome,'' which he described as a `` straight-ahead pop hit'' of the'70s, then put it back on because people like it. `` I tend to like later work better than earlier work as my skills develop,'' he said. `` And my outlook naturally is more synchronized with how I feel now. If I'm talking about subject matter that's 15 years old, that's what I thought 15 years ago. The songs are like snapshots.'' Not only do his songs form lasting pictures of moments in his life, but also reflect his artistic growth. `` Mother and Child Reunion'' is interesting to him because it was his first reggae piece. `` Me and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>'' has a <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> flavor and he used Brazilian percussion on it. `` Something So Right'' marks his first meeting with the award-winning producer-composer-musician <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who became a good friend. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> did the arrangement on the tune. `` St. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>'s Comet'' is a lullaby to his 16-year-old son, <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, when he was a baby. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> plays guitar and `` has come out of reggae into the Grateful Dead. He also likes <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, much to my surprise,'' says his father. Another song on the new LP, `` Loves Me Like a Rock'' represents <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s interest in gospel music. `` Have a Good Time'' has sax player <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. `` 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover'' was the first time he worked with <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> and the New York Rhythm Section. `` I thought I made some of my best records with that rhythm section,'' he said. The `` 50 Ways'' single also sold more than 1 million copies. `` Still Crazy After All These Years'' was the 1975 Grammy album of the year. It also won best pop male vocalist for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` Late in the Evening'' is Latin influenced. `` I'm interested in that and working with that now,'' he said. `` On ` Slip Slidin' Away,' I worked with the Oak Ridge Boys It was a movement toward country. `` My ` Hearts and Bones Album,' the one before ` Graceland,' is not familiar to most people. It did n't have any hit singles. It was a very autobiographical album and a very serious, somber album. The songs I included from it I think are three of my best songs. They were n't released as singles.'' The tunes are the title song, `` Train in the Distance,'' which includes the phrase `` Negotiations and Love Songs,'' and `` <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Georgette </PERSON> <PERSON> Magritte </PERSON> With Their Dog After the War.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> ends the LP with two songs from the Grammy-winning `` Graceland'' album: `` Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,'' and `` You Can Call Me Al.'' Graceland sold more than 3 million copies. `` I just keep reviewing the elements I've been interested in from the'60s and even earlier,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` I heard Latin and gospel music along with rock' n' roll when I was a kid growing up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Those are the elements of my work _ early sounds that I really liked, early rhythms that I remember. `` You go back and you recapitulate. And every time you reinvestigate, it goes deeper and you begin to more clearly focus on what it is that you really respond to emotionally or musically. And those are the elements that you keep.'' Because of that, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> says, his work becomes increasingly interesting. `` What is not interesting is making Top 40 hits. If it happens, it is just a pleasant surprise. At the early point of my career _ <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> _ everything was a hit. And we wanted it to be.'' When the 47-year-old songwriter composes he's primarily concerned with his own generation and with an entire album instead of individual songs. `` I want people to like it and find it interesting. It does n't necessarily have to be great numbers of people. I want people to say, ` I do n't know how many people are going to like this, but I like it.''' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> wo n't tour with `` Negotiations and Love Songs,'' but may go out after next summer's album. `` I think in my case, the music is better when you play it live,'' he said. `` A song takes a couple of days to make in a studio. When you're playing that song for six months, you start off copying the arrangement of the record. Most of the time it gets more interesting and more complex musically. Very often musicians work out things they did n't fully work out on the record date. `` You usually have a bigger band. There is room for soloists to play. As a vocalist you have a chance to rethink the phrasing, even the melody.''

<HEAD>Religious Right Program Falters But Is Now Political Staple</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the twilight of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration, he has n't pulled off most of his social programs dear to the religious right, but he's made them practically a political staple They simmer in the current national campaign, and religious scholars say <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has excelled at using his office as a `` bully pulpit'' for his upbeat-style sermonizing. `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years have been good for public theology'' despite its often thin quality, writes church historian <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marty </PERSON>. `` Religion, which had seemed a private affair in the 1970s, went public again in the l980s.'' <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> notes that in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency, growing attention has centered on such issues as values, virtue, education, moral formation, sexuality, family life, abortion and euthanasia Rabbi <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> writes in the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` is clearly the dominant <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> theologian of the l980s.'' But the content, he adds, is `` only sparkling optimisim _ theological <ORGANIZATION> Perrier </ORGANIZATION>.'' While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not achieved most of his social agenda, such as banning abortion, reinstating prayers in schools and providing tax credits for children in private schools, he's still preaching them. They're also backed by his party's candidate to succeed him, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Says <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: `` Although we Americans have done much to put our national life back on the firm foundation of traditional values, there is still a great deal to be done.'' He told a summer Youth for Christ rally in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that `` as a nation we must embrace our faith, for as long as we endeavor to do good ... we will find our strength, our hope and our true happiness in prayer and the Lord's will.'' Although <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rarely attends church himself, he strikes his vintage religious chords. He told the youths: `` I would like someday to entertain an atheist at dinner and serve the most gourmet, perfect dinner that has ever been served, and then at the end of the meal, ask that atheist if he believes there's a cook.'' He said 4,000 abortions a day `` must stop,'' and he said Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` believes with me'' about it. `` Abortion is the taking of a human life.'' `` So far, we have n't succeeded in persusading the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact legislation that would once again permit voluntary prayer in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools,'' he said. `` But I'm convinced that, one day soon, such a measure will be passed.'' In <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly rejected measures to authorize school prayers, give tax breaks for for private school tuition or to amend the constitution to overturn the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision allowing abortion. Some leaders of the religious right, which had strongly backed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the presidency, have criticized him as not pushing hard enough for the measures, suggesting he gave them only lip service. While the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> right emerged as a political force in the 1980s, it is losing `` influence on the national level,'' says historian <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribuffo </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. However, historian <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> advices against underestimating it, saying it `` did get people talking about the family and personal values.'' He says it has gained legitimacy by adding `` scores of causes'' to its prime anti-abortion cause, and also has overcome objections to its involvement in politics. `` By and large the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> won its point'' _ that it had a legitimate voice in politics, <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> writes in Context, his journal of commentary on religion and culture. But he says the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> rightists `` did not win much'' in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. `` They wanted less government and they got more; they wanted less debt and ended up with the greatest ever; they wanted dismantled social welfare programs and got some, but it was selective.'' However, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asserted a `` major victory'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s recent upholding of an act allowing grants to religious groups to counsel the young against promiscuity. On that subject, he offered his advice to 9000 youths at their <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Evangelism, saying `` it's important for you not to pay any attention at all to all those who say that promiscuity is somehow stylish or rewarding.'' He said `` the right thing to do is to wait for that one special person.'' To be true in marriage, he said, `` you can start being true to that one special person beginning now.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also took credit for the Equal Rights Act, giving religious groups the same right to meet after school the same as other clubs. However, schools are still refusing to do so, challenging the law in court. Recalling a story of the country's origins, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> played one of his frequent themes: `` If <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> rose to invoke the Almighty as the Constitution itself was being drafted _ if the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opens each day with prayer _ then is n't it time we let God back into the classroom?''

 The Roman Catholic Diocese of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> says severe financial strain from continued ownership of television station <ORGANIZATION> KDTU </ORGANIZATION> has forced elimination of 14 jobs, suspension of some services and imposition of salary cuts. `` The financial resources of the diocese have been severely pressured by the continuing financial demands caused by the diocesan-owned television station,'' Bishop <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> said in a letter to parishes. He said efforts have failed over the last three years to sell the UHF station, Channel 18, which went on the air in 1984, and the `` continuing demands caused by its operations'' have forced reductions in diocesan services to parishes.

<HEAD>Television Serves as Islamic Moral Guardian</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Viewers may tire of a mullah chanting from the Moslem holy book, but there is no alternative when he's on The government runs television in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and uses it as a watchdog of Islamic morality. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> television has prepared interesting programs reflecting Islamic social values for the October-to-December quarter,'' program director <PERSON> Zaheer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhatti </PERSON> told the government news agency. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, he said that should not be interpreted as fundamentalist or reactionary. <PERSON> Bhatti </PERSON> dismissed the self-righteous view of Western television as a sinkhole of promiscuity, alcoholism and drug addiction, but also said there are basic differences between East and West, Moslem and non-Moslem. `` We want to make -LRB- the young -RRB- aware of the positive values in our society,'' he said. `` We do n't see the past of any society as a separate entity. It is a progression and we say we are a progressive religion.'' Television is a tool for preserving Pakistani culture, <PERSON> Bhatti </PERSON> said, and mentioned such things as keeping traditional dress from being supplanted by T-shirts, jeans and three-piece suits. Weekly television series display the cultures of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s five provinces. Love is a common theme, with the young in search of love often pitted against an older generation clinging to the tradition of arranged marriages. `` We do n't believe in sermonizing through the box,'' <PERSON> Bhatti </PERSON> said. `` We do not talk down to people; we talk to people.'' A series called `` Waris'' was a favorite of the late President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>. It was set in the interior of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> province and told of a powerful, dictatorial landowner who clashed with his sons and tenants. Some Pakistanis said the landlord was intended as a portrayal of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who was hanged in 1979, two years after Gen. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> overthrew him in a mlitary coup. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> now leads the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which was founded by her father and is the main political opposition. About two months before his death in a plane crash Aug. 17, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> announced that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would adopt Islamic law. Women protested in the streets, feeling their hard-won gains would slip away, and whether to implement Islamic law now will be left to the government organized after elections Nov. 16. Subtle changes began occuring on <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> television after <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s pronouncement and continued after his death Fewer women were seen on the tube, particularly in commercials, and more covered their heads. Women anchoring the evening news wore headscarves. <PERSON> Bhatti </PERSON> acknowledged the number of women in commercials has been reduced. Glamorous women in skin-tight dresses slipping into the latest car never were part of Pakistani television, but <PERSON> Bhatti </PERSON> said even tamer depictions of women to sell products is being reduced. If a product is for use by either men or women, a man will appear in the ommercial, he said, and `` the unnecessary use of females to sell products'' will be stopped. Foreign programs will continue to appear because <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s television industry can not produce enough programs to fill the time, but officials are selective, he said Dramas are included, but the emphasis is on such educational and informative programs as documentaries by <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>.

 Is there life after `` The Phantom of the Opera'' for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>? Emphatically `` yes'' says the man who conquered Broadway last season, carting off every theater award in sight, including a Tony. Now <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> has left the cast of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> production of `` Phantom,'' but even his departure from the hit musical was spectacular. After missing more than a week because of a virus, the star returned Oct. 8 for one final performance. During curtain calls, the entire cast showered <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> with red roses. They were assisted by members of the audience, some of them running down the aisles of the Majestic Theater to toss flowers on the stage. An emotional <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> spoke to the theatergoers, choking on what he said was the same thing he told his mother on his 21st birthday. `` I'd like to thank you for having me,'' he told the cheering crowd. `` You're perfection,'' yelled one enthusiastic woman. But <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> has not hung up his `` Phantom'' mask and put away his makeup for good. The actor plans to do at least a nine-month engagement, beginning next May, in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> company of `` Phantom.'' It's the best possible audition for the movies. `` The film people are there, and they'd see it,'' he says. `` I have got very strong interest and offers from two studios. If I'm in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, I can work on development as it is happening. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> has made movies before. Film buffs know him from `` The Knack,'' `` A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' `` Hello, Dolly!'' and `` How I Won the War.'' But this is the first time a movie will be planned around him. What a difference a hit musical can make to a career. `` I do n't think I was known over here at all,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> says. In <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, he was a star. He appeared in several hit British television series and had done three big musicals in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION> _ `` <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>,'' `` Flowers for <PERSON> Algernon </PERSON>'' and `` Barnum.'' The last show, an American musical, had an even longer run in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> than it did in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It ran so long we had births and deaths in the audience,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> says. `` People died, and we had a woman give birth once. It was like life aboard a 747 on an around-the-world trip.'' `` Phantom'' _ with the help of exposure on national television shows such as `` West 57th Street'' _ has made his face familiar to fans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` When I first opened in ` Phantom' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> even the stage managers would ask, ` Are you <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>?,''' he says. Before he left the show, there were crowds of 50 to 60 people waiting each night at the stage door to see him. And the letters never stopped coming. Every day he would receive more than 100 letters, some from overseas and addressed simply, `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, Broadway, <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s most dedicated followers have been an informal group of Britishers called the OGRES, which stands for Opera Ghosts Return Enthusiasts. Many of them came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for his final Broadway appearance. Some had been here twice before, unfurling banners down the Majestic alleyway that proclaimed `` Bring Him Home.'' `` There are about 25 of them and they wo n't let anyone else join,'' he says. `` They are very exclusive. And if anyone misbehaves, they are out. Or if they bother me. They do n't like to annoy me. They are very good to me.'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> also has widened his appeal with his first solo recording, `` Songs From the Stage and Screen'' that he made before he opened `` Phantom'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They have sold over 200,000 copies on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, so it's on its way to gold,'' he says `` And I'm very pleased. There was a terrific amount of care gone into that record.'' The album, which includes a medley of songs from `` West Side Story'' and such Broadway classics as `` If I Loved You,'' `` Memory'' and `` You'll Never Walk Alone,'' has sold well all over the world. `` It's triple platinum in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, which means it has sold 20,000 copies,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> says. `` Even the sheep are buying it.'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> will go back into the recording studio early next year in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to record a second album, this time a collection of love songs. He hopes to include `` Music of the Night,'' his big number from `` Phantom,'' if composer <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> grants his permission. The performer also is considering several new Broadway musicals, although none he can talk about. `` But it's nice that I've been asked,'' he says. `` And one of them is of particular interest to me.'' After his final performance in `` Phantom,'' a role now being played by <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to make a documentary film for a British charity. Then he may begin to relax for a few weeks. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> admits he'll miss the hoopla that accompanied his 10-month `` Phantom'' run in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, although there are tradeoffs. `` I'll be glad to have it quiet after all that attention,'' he says. `` You need that quiet whenever you have finished a show that is an event.''

<HEAD>Pardon for Butting In But USDA Has Something To Say About Goats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In case <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> want to talk about goats, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has some new material speechwriters can use. No kidding. It would be good for rebuttal, too. Goats are among the most non-controversial farm topics around. They have n't been involved in any huge <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> subsidy flap and are not a big legislative issue on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Moreover, while city folk may have trouble identifying with modern feedlots that send beef to their tables, or the farrowing pens that turn out pork chops and sausage, just about everyone feels good about goats. `` Since before biblical times, goats may have been the most useful of domesticated animal, producing milk for drinking or for cheese, gourmet meat -LRB- cabrito -RRB-, leather, and fiber for clothing -LRB- cashmere or Angora -RRB-, not to be confused with Angora -LRB- rabbit -RRB- wool,'' says the department's <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The goat report is the latest in a series of single-sheet papers turned out by the agency's Office for Small-Scale Agriculture. Others include such topics as sheep, mushrooms, foliage plants, herbs, wildflowers and specialty vegetables. Goats are relatively clean and make `` fine pets and show animals,'' the report said. Worldwide, there may be as many 460 million, which produce an estimated 4.5 million metric tons of milk annually. But before people quit the city job, politics or other endeavor, there are some things they should know about raising goats for a living or as a supplement to other income. `` They, of course, need care to keep dogs away and skillful management to prevent diseases and internal as well as external parasites such as lice, mites and fleas,'' the report said. `` Goat milk is so respected that there have been people who began raising dairy goats before learning whether they could sell the milk or knew how to make cheese.'' One problem is that in at least 21 states, goat milk must be pasteurized, or heated to a prescribed temperature, to kill potentially harmful bacteria. And pasteurization can cost a bundle for equipment. Where milk can be sold raw, herds must be licensed and the nannies must be carefully tested and kept free of brucellosis and tuberculosis, which are contagious to humans. Lest anyone sneer at someone's plan to operate a goat ranch on a couple of acres beyond the zoning of outer surburbia, goats have assumed something of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hauteur of late. In 1987, for the first time, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recognized the merits of the dairy goat, proclaiming a National Dairy Goat Awareness Week. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, it was said, supported the idea enthusiastically and had recalled `` with fondness the time about 25 years ago when each or our two doe goats had quintuplets on our ranch in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' Goats are raised for non-dairy purposes such as for meat and leather or fine hair, the report said. Farmers and ranchers who are already pasturing some sheep or cattle, or both, may be able to add some goats without any problems. `` Goats eat some plants that sheep and cattle do n't seek, so they are not mutually exclusive,'' the report said. `` They pasture well together.'' The meat, or cabrito _ sometimes called chevon _ has little fat and `` tastes better than venison,'' the report said. Worldwide, production is more than 1.2 million metric tons a year. `` With a flock of 350 to 400 Spanish does, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckholz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dripping </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who raises goats for meat, annually sells their offspring for meat at eight months of age for $ 30 a head,'' the report said. `` Since the stock is tough, thrifty and hardy, he has lots of pasture and some Pyrenees dogs to keep predators such as coyotes and wild dogs at bay, <PERSON> Buckholz </PERSON>'s expenses are relatively small.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, sometimes feed young goats, or kids, only about two months until they reach 35 to 40 pounds. The young animals are then sold at nearly $ 1 a pound in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area, where there is often a shortage of goats in November and December. For free single copies of the report, `` Goats,'' or any of the others published so far, write to: Office for <ORGANIZATION> Small-Scale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, Office of Grants and Program Systems, Room 342-D, Aerospace Building, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20251-2200.

 The stock market has gotten a modest boost from new government reports pointing to an economic slowdown. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.29 points Monday to 2,140.47. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that goods held on shelves and backlots in August rose 0.8 percent to $ 733.7 billion, following a 0.7 percent gain in July. It was the 20th consecutive monthly increase. Rising inventories can be a sign of economic sluggishness as manufacturers order production cuts and layoffs while goods in reserve are sold off. In another government report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the overall operating rate last month at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities fell to 83.6 percent of capacity, down 0.2 percentage point from August. The strain on the nation's industrial capacity eased for the first time in seven months as utilities scaled back after the summer heat wave, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said. The latest government reports also supported bond prices, driving interest rates lower. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond fell to 8.86 percent from 8.90 percent late Friday. In foreign-exchange trading, the dollar rose against most major currencies after reports of intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> lifted it from its lows of the day. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency finished in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at around 127.07 Japanese yen, up from 126.70 yen late Friday. As part of its business inventories report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said August sales totaled $ 487.7 billion, up a brisk 1.1 percent from July, when the gain was a slight 0.1 percent. It was the ninth increase in a row. In other economic developments Monday: _ A <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> report concluded that an entrenched budget deficit and fundamental policy flaws have destabilized the nation's economy, and the next president will have to take major steps to turn it around _ The oil ministers of the six-nation <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said they supported an increase in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s output quotas as a way to try to stabilize prices Analysts said stock traders took a generally upbeat view of the current state of the economy, believing that growth has slowed of late to a steady, sustainable pace. But inflation worries have n't been entirely snuffed out on Wall Street, and brokers said investors were looking ahead warily to Friday's scheduled report on the consumer price index for September. Furthermore, just about all market-watchers agree, investors are likely to be leery of stocks all week with the anniversary Wednesday of last fall's crash, and all the attendant publicity.

 Energy futures prices continue to climb, but analysts warn that trading will be volatile while <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members hold a series of meetings in hopes of lowering crude oil production. The November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, rose 29 cents Monday to close at $ 15.21 a 42-gallon barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Subsequent contract months settled about 22 cents a barrel higher. Analysts said the November contract had additional strength because of tight supplies. Refined products traded on the exchange followed a similar pattern, with near-term contracts posting the largest gains. The November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline picked up 1.34 cents to settle at 46.76 cents a gallon, while the November contract for home heating oil rose 0.67 cent to 43.88 cents a gallon. Prices zigzagged Monday before rising amid optimism that the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meetings could end the cartel's overproduction problems. `` People are expecting a lot of volatility in the market for the next few weeks,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market still looks strong, but people are afraid it's overbought and will run out of good news to keep it up.''

<HEAD>Firm Says It Will Appeal In Effort Remove Judge From Fraud Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will appeal a judge's refusal to quit presiding over the government's massive civil-fraud suit against the firm, raising the prospect of more delays and pretrial theatrics in a case that already has acquired celebrity status in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s angry rejection Monday of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s move to disqualify him was seen outwardly as a setback for the Wall Street giant, some attorneys following the courtroom battle saw it as a plus for the defense, which is trying to portray <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> as a victim of prejudice. `` You ca n't lose,'' said one attorney, who spoke on condition he not be identified. `` This effort has to be for the purpose of creating the picture that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is a fine company mistreated by the courts.'' <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> denied <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> motions to stop him from ruling on its case as well as in other cases involving the firm and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the imprisoned inside trader who implicated <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and others in alleged wrongdoing when he was exposed nearly two years ago. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, a respected 82-year-old jurist who has been presiding over most Boesky-related litigation for more than a year, deemed the defense strategy to remove him a ludicrous, time-wasting ploy. His opinion seemed to further raise the level of antagonism between <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> lawyers and the judge since the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filed its wide-ranging fraud suit against the firm and other defendants last month. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> already has chastised several defense lawyers for their conduct in the case and referred two of them to the chief judge of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court for possible disciplinary sanctions. A raucous hearing last week on defense efforts to disqualify <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> on grounds of possible bias featured emotional exchanges between him and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> attorneys, who are among the most highly paid in the country. That session drew a packed audience, unusual in securities law cases. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> lawyers applauded <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s opinion Monday and expressed eagerness to proceed. Private attorneys suing <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> also welcomed the ruling. Defense attorneys did not return telephone calls for comment. But <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said in a statement: `` Our attorneys had a professional obligation to bring this issue before the court. Since it is their considered view that, based on the facts in the motion, Judge <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s position is incorrect, the matter will be placed before the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> claims <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> has a conflict of interest because his wife, <LOCATION> Moselle </LOCATION>, stands to gain $ 30 million from the sale of her stock in <ORGANIZATION> Palais </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Houston-based concern going private in a transaction that indirectly involves <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> financing. Although Mrs. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s financial interest would make it appear that <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> is biased in <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s favor, defense lawyers had argued they wanted a judge whose impartiality could not possibly be questioned by the public. `` There is no financial or business connection, or other relationship between Mrs. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>,'' the judge wrote. `` There is simply no reasonable basis for doubting the court's impartiality in this case by reason of the <ORGANIZATION> Palais </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> stock sale; no facts, no rational basis, have been supplied. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> wrote that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s motion seemed so far-fetched `` as to be ludicrous and hardly a basis for a judge to step aside.'' Privately, many lawyers have speculated the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> defense wants another judge because of <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s reputation as a tough, no-nonsense securities-law expert tending to side with the government in fraud cases. Legal experts familiar with courtroom strategies to disqualify judges doubted the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> effort to remove <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> would prevail. `` It is fairly common to use a motion to disqualify as sort of a diversion,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` Sometimes the strategy is serious, when there are reasons to fear the judge. Sometimes the motion is made because you do n't like the judge,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` It generally fails, miserably.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and four key employees of the firm Sept. 7 alleging they secretly plotted with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to manipulate stock, profit on inside information about corporate takeovers, cheat clients and engage in other frauds. The defendants have denied the charges.

 Wall Street was kept in the dark, as the law requires, before <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced its $ 11 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The best evidence that there were no widespread leaks of the surprise takeover bid late Monday is that trading in both stocks was about average and there were no big price changes. The offer was announced after the close of trading. Small amounts of insider trading would not affect volumes or prices, but a rumor that traveled far quickly would have pushed <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s stock price toward <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>'s offer of $ 90 a share, and trading would have been heavy.

<HEAD>Rales Brothers Increase Interco Bid to $2.84 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In their latest attempt to win over <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, the <PERSON> Rales </PERSON> brothers sweetened their tender offer for the furniture and apparel maker to $ 2.84 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Through </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Washington-based sibling team of <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rales </ORGANIZATION> on Monday offered $ 74 a share in cash for each of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s 38.4 million outstanding shares. The offer tops the tender offer the duo launched in August by $ 4 a share, but also represents the fourth time the <PERSON> Rales </PERSON> brothers have bid for the St. Louis-based company. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>, which rejected the earlier <PERSON> Rales </PERSON> offers and instead unveiled a restructuring plan, had no immediate comment on the latest bid, said company spokesman <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>. The Rales brothers made their first overtures to <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s management in July, offering to acquire the company for $ 64 a share In August, the group launched a tender offer at $ 70 a share, which <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> immediately rejected. On Sept. 20, the brothers again were rebuffed after proposing a friendly merger at $ 72-a-share that was conditioned on the company providing them with certain confidential information. The sweetened tender offer was announced shortly before the close of trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed at $ 71.50 a share, up $ 1.62 -LCB- but still below Cardinal's latest offer <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> said the offer would remain open until midnight Oct. 31, unless extended. However, last week, a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> ordered the brothers to keep their bid open pending a further ruling in litigation between <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> over the tender offer. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> has filed suit against <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON>, charging it violated federal regulations by failing to disclose that the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was a co-bidder. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> also charged that the proposed takeover violates federal regulations by being too highly leveraged. At the time <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> rejected the Rales group's $ 72-a-share bid, the company unveiled a $ 2.8 billion restructuring and recapitalization program that <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> said could include a sale of its <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> furniture unit and other businesses. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s other products include <PERSON> Broyhill </PERSON> furniture, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Fog rainwear and <ORGANIZATION> Florsheim </ORGANIZATION> and Converse shoes. The restructuring also includes payment of a special dividend of $ 25 in cash and securities per share. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Saligman </PERSON> said the restructuring plan was worth $ 76 a share. The Raleses have insisted on a chance to bid on any assets <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> might put up for sale and warned of `` unfortunate consequences'' _ possibly legal action or a shareholder proxy fight _ if they are not consulted before any assets are sold.

 <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> executives, saying they wo n't be `` beaten, bought or buried,'' filed a lawsuit to halt a hostile takeover of the Alabama-based grocery chain by A & amp; P. The <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has offered $ 30 a share, or $ 210 million for <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION>, which operates supermarkets in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> The latest offer marks the third time in two years that A & amp; P has bid for the company. In announcing the suit filed Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> at Mobile, <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Delchamps </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> called the A & amp; P offer `` cheap.'' The lawsuit accused A & amp; P and others of failing to disclose potential violations of antitrust laws and failure to reveal an alleged plan to financially cripple <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> even if it fails to buy the company. <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> said A & amp; P's motive was to either purchase the firm `` at a cheap price and proceed with its plan to achieve dominance in the Gulf Coast retail stores market'' or cause the firm to suffer high legal bills and induce a leverage buyout that would weaken <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> as a competitor. `` A & amp; P has not been able to compete with us effectively in the marketplace, so it has obviously decided, ` If you ca n't beat them, buy them or bury them with investment bankers and lawyers.' We do n't intend to be beaten, bought or buried,'' <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> said. A & amp; P spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rourke </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> operates 102 grocery stores and six liquor stores. A & amp; P, headquartered in <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, is 52 percent owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Tengelmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A & amp; P made its first offer for <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> in October 1986, another in October 1987 and another this month. Between the first and last attempts, the offering price has risen from $ 23 to $ 30 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION>' stock was trading at $ 26.50 a share in the over-the-counter market Monday afternoon, up 50 cents from Friday, while A & amp; P's stock was down 37 -LCB- cents at $ 46.62 -LCB- a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> had sales of about $ 700 million last year.

<TEXT>
 The next president will have to take major steps to turn around an economy destabilized by an entrenched budget deficit and policy flaws, say economic advisers of varying political stripes in a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> report. In a set of eight papers, experts from consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> to Nobel laureate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON> offer the next president economic advice amid a presidential campaign that the magazine says has produced `` a lot of partisan noisiness'' but little serious deliberation. `` There's a fundamental basic instability in the economic system right now,'' <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> Editor <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said Monday, summing up the papers. The magazine had asked panel members to write memos advising the next president on a range of economic issues. The 42-page report will appear in the magazine's November-December issue. The underlying conclusion: a fundamental instability in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic system needs to be addressed. Indeed, the federal budget deficit is so deeply rooted that it wo n't solve itself in the normal course of economic events. <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> professor emeritus, argues that fear of alienating voters has `` frightened away all candidates from even discussing vital economic issues.'' The new president, he says, should spend his first year trying to reduce the deficit from about 3 percent of the nation's $ 4 trillion gross national product toward 2 percent, and, ultimately, by 1992 eliminating all deficit that is n't cyclical. A basic structural deficit is one that exists regardless of prevailing economic conditions, so that public debt rises even after the nation returns to full employment. Cyclical deficits are tied to inflation, unemployment and other economic conditions. `` When asked how to tame a basic deficit, one might answer prosaically: ` By expenditure cuts and tax increases.''' But <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON> says the new president needs to abandon the notion that the deficit can be reduced by either cutting spending or raising taxes or a 50-50 combination. The experts _ two of whom advise the presidential candidates, Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ offer detailed advice for increasing capital formation, modernizing the nation's manufacturing base and overhauling public education. `` Tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people the truth _ that today's apparent prosperity is being borrowed from the future, that our children will be angry and frustrated when they are left with a lower standard of living,'' advises <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former counselor for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> affairs to the Secretary of Commerce. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, a thorn in the side of big business for 25 years, surprisingly argues that government can learn from business to become more efficient, humane, creative and responsive. `` -LRB- The next president -RRB- should break through the legendary Oval Office cocoon to communicate regularly and directly with federal workers,'' he says. `` He should visit major departments, mix it up with the employees, listen to their ideas, stimulate their thinking and remind them of the importance of their mission.'' Conservative economist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adviser, counsels avoiding protectionist policies that some industries may press for during the long road back to trade balance. `` If you accede to these pressures, you would not only hurt American consumers and weaken the competitiveness of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry, but would also risk the start of a protectionist trade war,'' he writes. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> cites research showing that if current demographic and economic trends continue, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses will have to hire a million new workers a year who ca n't read, write or count _ at an annual cost to industry of $ 25 `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government spends more money on agriculture research than it does on education research. It's no wonder we know more about pork bellies and soybean futures than we do about our schools,'' he said.

<HEAD>State To Hike Withholding Rate On Bonuses</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> says it will place a higher wihholding tax on bonuses, commissions and other supplemental wages to make it harder for those in the financial services industry to evade taxes. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that starting Jan. 1, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> will hike its withholding tax to 7.875 percent from 5 percent on supplemental income sources unless taxpayers make prior arrangements to have withholding taxes figured at the same rate as regular wages. State Tax Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetzler </PERSON> said the change stems from a tax department investigation that turned up thousands of tax evaders at prominent Wall Street brokerages and investment houses, including employees at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. When arrests were made of some top-level employees of those businesses in April, former Tax Commissioner <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> said state officials were `` numbed and shocked'' at how widespread the tax cheating had become on Wall Street. At that time, <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> said the state had found more than 5,700 income tax evaders, including 1,519 people with salaries of more than $ 50,000 a year. The probe revealed that many brokers and investment counselors were properly paying state income taxes on their regular salaries. But they were found to be paying the 5 percent withholding tax and no more on the bonuses, partnership distributions and other supplemental income they were receiving. In many cases, said tax department spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickard </PERSON>, non-salary income is far larger than the regular pay the executives get. <PERSON> Rickard </PERSON> said he had no estimate of how much in taxes experts feel the state is getting cheated out of in that manner. According to <PERSON> Wetzler </PERSON>, the changes on bonus and commission withholding is expected to bring the state about $ 55 million more in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1989, and $ 90 million more in the fiscal year beginning the next day. Tax officials said the state has now matched a list of employees of 1,100 banks, investment firms and stock brokerages with a list of people not filing income tax returns. <PERSON> Rickard </PERSON> said 10,000 warning letters will be mailed by the tax department this week to people the state suspects of not properly filing returns. According to the spokesman, the state is continuing the process of settling accounts with those taxpayers found to be shortchanging the state this spring. He said tax officials are expanding their probe to other fields where some workers earn big bonuses or commissions, such as real estate.

<TEXT>
 Financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has broken off efforts to acquire ailing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> after failing to structure a deal that would satisfy the carrier's unions. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that `` the talks are over.'' `` It's unfortunate because a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would have been very positive for <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. But what will be will be,'' he said in today's editions of the newspaper. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> reportedly notified <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, on Monday that he was unable to reach an understanding with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s three unions over the weekend. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> had been negotiating for more than a week with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilot and machinist unions, although <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> never made a specific acquisition proposal. Last Wednesday, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> agreed to buy the Eastern shuttle for $ 365 million in cash. Sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that the union talks broke down mainly because <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was seeking wage concessions from the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions that the union leaders considered too severe. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> `` got too greedy,'' one union source told the Journal. The newspaper also reported that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> negotiators became angry when <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s machinist union tried to tie its forthcoming contract negoiations with the talks with Eastern. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> reportedly had given <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> an exclusive right until the end of the week to make an offer for Eastern to the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> board of directors. After that deadline, other interested parties could come forward with offers. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> executives have indicated that money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, minus its profitable Northeast air shuttle, would be worth around $ 1 billion, according to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, other parties that have expressed an interest in buying the rest of Eastern include <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Corr </PERSON>, who is a close associate of <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, and a group of major insurance companies, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A French professor whose visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the Depression sparked his interest in economics today won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>, 77, won the award `` for his pioneering contributions to the theory of markets and efficient utilization of resources.'' <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> told reporters at his suburban <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> home that the award was `` mindboggling.'' `` My motivation when I was young was an idea of being able to improve the conditions of life, to try to find a remedy to many of the problems facing the world,'' he said. `` That's what led me into economics. I saw it as a way of helping people.'' He was the first French economist to win the coveted award since it was created in 1968. Americans have dominated the prize, taking 15 of the 25 awards since it was created by the Bank of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Five winners were British. <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> did his economic research at the <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superieure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION>, the academy said. Although his work is little known outside <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> `` is the most prominent figure in modern economic research in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> as regards basic theory and applications to public-sector planning,'' said the 300-member academy in a statement. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s most prestigious institutions of higher education, said <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> `` was the mentor for everyone involved in the economy in postwar <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> between 1945 and 1968.'' Within the world of French economic thought after World War II _ in which leftists and rightists agreed that the state should play a major role in the economy _ <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> established a place for reliance on market forces. <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>'s work provided `` a very strong base for those opposed to government direction of the economy,'' said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautman </PERSON>, scientific director for human sciences at <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>' training was as an engineer. But in the 1930s, he visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the Depression, seeing factories idled and people unemployed. `` This is what sparked him to consecrate his life to economics,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. The academy said <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>' greatest contributions came in the 1940s with his work on market equilibrium and efficiency. He published works in 1943 and 1947 detailing his theories, which provided guidelines for using prices in monopolies and for public sector planning. The son of a cheese store owner, <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> was born in 1911 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. He is a professor of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superieure </ORGANIZATION> des Mines. His works include: Frequency, Probability and Chance; The General Theory of Surplus; and Third World at the Crossroads. <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>, who has served in French governments in several positions and was named an officer of the Legion of Honor in 1977, also wrote studies on history and physics. He graduated at the top of his class from <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnique </ORGANIZATION> in 1933 and then attended the <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superieure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> until 1936. <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> joins three drug researchers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> who became 1988 Nobel laureates on Monday for discoveries leading to medications for heart disease, AIDS and other deadly illnesses. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solow </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, won the economics prize last year for creating a model showing how technology and other factors influence economic growth. The economics prize is a late addition to the five awards established in the 1896 will of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, who bequeathed his fortune from the invention of dynamite to reward scientific breakthroughs, activities for peace, and literature `` of an idealistic tendency.'' On Wednesday the prizes in physics and chemistry will be announced, closing the list of laureates for this year. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces were awarded the peace prize Sept. 29 by the <ORGANIZATION> Norwegian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>. The literature prize was won by Egyptian novelist <PERSON> Naguib </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahfouz </PERSON>. The prizes carry a cash award of 2.5 million kronor, or about $ 390,000 at today's exchange rate. The prizes will be distributed Dec. 10 in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, except the peace prize which is given the same day in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>. On Monday the medicine prize was awarded to <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elion </PERSON>, 70, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>, 83, for identifying differences in the processing of genetic materials in normal cells and cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria and viruses. They shared the prize with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> who discovered beta blockers, the key to developing medicines which calm the body, control blood pressure and help prevent fatalities in heart attack victims.

 Manufacturing states, which have lagged behind the national average in personal income growth during the 1980s, began to close the gap in the year ended in June, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said non-farm personal incomes continued to grow fastest in the high-tech industrial states of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> from the second quarter of 1987 to the second quarter of this year, as they have through most of the current economic expansion. From the end of the last recession in the third quarter of 1982 and continuing through the April-June period of last year, incomes in the coastal regions _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, Southeast and <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> _ have grown faster than in the regions in the middle _ <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> area. The disparity has led administration critics to dub the current expansion `` the bicoastal economy.'' However, in the last year, the mix has begun to change. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> is still on top but <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states dependent on traditional heavy manufacturing are improving and income growth in the Southeast and Far West has cooled a bit. For the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a whole, the annual rate of non-farm personal income growth for the year ended in June was 7.7 percent, up from 7.1 percent in the earlier part of the economic expansion. Here's how the various regions fared: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>: 9.5 percent, up from 8.7 percent. <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION>: 8.7 percent, up from 7.4 percent. Far West: 7.8 percent, down from 8.2 percent. Great Lakes: 7.7 percent, up from 6.2 percent. Southeast: 7.5 percent, down from 7.9 percent. Plains: 6.2 percent, up from 5.9 percent. Southwest: 5.8 percent, up from 5.5 percent. Rocky Mountain: 5.2 percent, up from 5.1 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attributed gains in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> states to strength in the manufacturing of durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years, and in construction. It said the <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> region also benefited from a pickup in manufacturing. Growth in the Southeast as a whole was down, but by state it was mixed. Weak growth in incomes from service jobs in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and interior states more than offset strong growth in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast states of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Economists have been anticipating gains in the so-called manufacturing `` Rust Belt'' of the nation. The drop in the value of the dollar over the last three years has made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods less expensive on overseas markets and has fueled a boom in export sales this year.

 British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said today he will appeal a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> judge's refusal to overturn a key element in <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s buyout agreement with a rival suitor. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said he also planned to seek an order barring the consummation of the rival group's tender offer for the publishing and information services giant. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> has agreed to a $ 2.5 billion buyout by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> senior management. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> has offered $ 2.51 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> under certain conditions, and both sides have tender offers out that are scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. EDT Wednesday. On Monday, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, a judge in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, denied <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s request for an injunction against a `` lockup provision'' that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> granted <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> in case its buyout offer failed. The provision gives the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> group the right to buy four of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s businesses for $ 865 million should the merger fail to materialize. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, who is making his bid through his <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had argued that the provision was unfair and said he would be willing to pay $ 900 million for the same units, which include the Berlitz language centers, the directory division, the direct marketing division and a division that publishes state legal codes. But <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> argued that the provision was needed to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> group to raise its bid for the company. In today's statement, <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> said it `` intends to appeal the court's decision and will move today in the appropriate courts for an injunction barring the consummation of <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer and barring <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> from entering into any transactions out of the ordinary course of business pending that appeal.'' When the company concluded an auction for itself late last month, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> offered $ 89 a share in cash for its 27.8 million shares, while <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 90.05 a share in cash and securities. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> agreed to the <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> offer, but <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> subsequently raised his offer to $ 90.25 a share in cash. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said in his ruling that while `` the auction procedures were deficient in several respects ... the evidence is not sufficient to persuade the court that those infirmities were responsible in a legal sense for <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> not receiving -LRB- <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s -RRB- highest bid before the auction gavel fell.'' The judge did grant <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s request for an injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s poison-pill defense, which could have been used to dilute his stake in the company if he were to begin to accumulate <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> stock. The judge said he granted the request on condition that <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> proceed with his offer. Among <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s options are to appeal the decision to a higher court. He had conditioned his tender offer on, among other things, the elimination of both the poison pill provision and the lockup option. He had argued that if <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> were allowed to buy the four units, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> would be left with a $ 250 million tax liability on the sale.

<HEAD>MCI Earnings Up Nearly Six-Fold in 3rd-Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its earnings rose nearly six-fold in the third quarter on a 40.8 percent rise in revenue. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest long-distance company, said its net income rose to a record $ 99 million, or 38 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with $ 17 million, or 6 cents per share, in 1987. Third-quarter revenue rose to a record $ 1.4 billion for the quarter, compared with $ 994 million for the same period last year. The company said earnings were driven by strong revenue growth from sales of 800-line and international services and gains in commercial accounts as well as improved operating margins. `` Our success in increasing both volume and market share while controlling costs has allowed us to take full advantage of the high operating leverage that is fundamental to this industry,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> president and chief operating officer. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> said the third quarter results included a pre-tax gain of $ 11 million from previously negotiated antitrust settlements and a pre-tax charge of $ 8 million associated with a contract settlement. Results for the third quarter of 1987 included a pre-tax gain of $ 2 million from antitrust settlements. The results for this year's quarter also reflected a 7.35 percent dividend on $ 400 million of preferred stock that was issued to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in August. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> also completed the repurchase of about 47 million shares of common stock from <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> earnings rose more than fivefold to $ 219 million, or 78 cents per share, from $ 41 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. Nine-month revenue rose 27.6 percent to $ 3.7 billion from $ 2.9 billion a year earlier.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s pay-for-performance program for its salaried workers is under review because it requires a ranking of non-union employees that some workers feel is unfair, a spokeswoman says. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> said Monday a decision on a compensation plan for salaried employees in 1989 has not been made. But she said the company is reacting to changes in the program which resulted in some employee concern that judgments about their performance were n't fair. She said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has used some form of a pay-for-performance plan for its salaried employees for years. `` The problem with the modifications made last year was not so much that it distinguished among employees as much as the perception that some people were judged, in their minds, unfairly,'' <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> said. The rankings were created to determine how large a raise, if any, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s 114,000 salaried employees should receive. But workers who learned of the rankings began grumbling that such information should not be widely circulated.

 Grain and soybean futures opened narrowly mixed today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting concerns about the rain-slowed harvest and disappointment in the pace of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat exports. Soybeans opened a little stronger in reaction to the wet Midwestern weather that has slowed harvesting and farmer selling of both soybeans and corn, analysts said. `` The corn market is very quiet,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There obviously is not much movement and harvesting has been slowed but the demand side of the market has been slow at the same time.'' Corn harvesting was 63 percent complete as of Sunday in the top 17 producing states while soybean harvesting was 90 percent finished in the top 19 producing states, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said late Monday. Wheat futures prices retreated slightly amid disappointment over the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of bids from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for large shipments of subsidized soft red wheat. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> did buy 110,000 metric tons of hard red wheat at a subsidized price, analysts said. In early trading, wheat was 1 \ cents to 3 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.27 a bushel; corn was unchanged to -LCB- cent lower with December at $ 2.94 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 3 cents higher with December at $ 2.58 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2 \ cents higher with November at $ 8.12 -LCB- Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .12 cent to .62 cent lower with October at 72.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .57 cent lower with October at 81.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent to .42 cent lower with October at 39.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .48 cent to .80 cent lower with February at 48.25 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled higher on Monday while pork futures were mixed.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors urged stockholders today to reject <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s unsolicited $ 5.23 billion bid for the food and restaurant company. The board described the $ 60-a-share offer as inadequate. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said its board instructed management to work with the company's financial and legal advisers to consider alternative courses that would boost the price of the company's stock and protect the best interests of the company and its shareholders. The company's stock was unchanged at $ 58.62 -LCB- a share in midday trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, a spokesman for Grand Met, said the British conglomerate had no immediate response to today's action by <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> board. In a letter sent to all <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The board believes that shareholders would realize greater value by retaining their stake in <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Now is not an appropriate time to sell the company. Remaining independent would be a superior alternative over the long term to accepting the Grand Met offer,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> added. At a news conference today, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s options could include selling the company to a third party, restructuring <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s finances by selling some businesses or going ahead with a leveraged buyout. He said <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> will give shareholders a better idea of the company's strategy before the deadline for tendering stock to Grand Met expires. `` The offer made by Grand Met, $ 60 a share, is not adequate,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Greater values are available to the shareholder in the long term.'' Asked what he thought <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s chances were in defending against a takeover bid by a well-heeled suitor, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, `` It ai n't over'til it's over.'' Wall Street analysts had speculated Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> would reject Grand Metropolitan's offer, which was made Oct. 4, and possibly announce a dividend-yielding restructuring in an effort to remain independent or possibly attract a better offer from Grand Metropolitan. There also was speculation that a European `` white knight,'' possibly <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, might emerge as a friendly merger partner. But <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> was not currently up for sale and that `` remaining independent would be a superior alternative over the long term to accepting the Grand Met offer.'' In his letter to shareholders, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, `` The board found that Grand Met's offer failed to reflect the values currently being developed at <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiaries under programs that are in the process of being implemented.'' Those programs include `` reinvesting'' in the company's core businesses, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> is a diversified international food company with operations in packaged consumer foods, including <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Haagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dazs </ORGANIZATION> products, and restaurants. Among its restuarants are Burger King, Steak and Ale and <PERSON> Bennigan </PERSON>'s. The Grand Met bid is one of two takeover attempts in among giants in the food industry that are currently under way. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 11 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that would make it the world's largest maker of consumer goods. Like <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> indicated it might fight the takeover.

 The stock market was mostly lower in moderate trading at midday today, as an early rally fueled by takeover activity in the food industry ran out of steam. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 4.80 points at 2,135.67 at noon EDT. Declining stocks were slightly ahead of advancing ones, with 634 issues lower, 614 higher and 550 unchanged.

<HEAD>Health Maintenance Group Mergers Microcosm Of National Trend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRETT J. BLACKLEDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This Midwestern city, once recognized nationally for the swift emergence of health maintenance organizations, is now at the center of an industrywide shakeout. The merger of four <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> health care plans within a few months represents a growing national trend of consolidation among HMOs. `` It sounds like a western, but this town's not big enough for more plans,'' said Dr. C.B. Rebsamen of PruCare of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, one of three surviving health maintenance plans left in a city that once offered more than 20. `` I think what's happening in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> is an example of what the rest of the country is experiencing,'' said <PERSON> Rebsamen </PERSON>, who is head of the doctor group for PruCare. `` We seem to be experiencing the end of the boost in the industry.'' HMOs, which emerged earlier this decade as an alternative to traditional health insurance, are prepaid plans of health services that include preventive treatment. The plans, buoyed by federal legislation requiring many employers to provide HMOs as an option to employees, offer health services through physician groups controlled by HMO units, independent groups or private physicians who agree to participate. Industry observers say the large number of insolvencies and repeated annual losses for HMOs are due to the rapid expansion in the industry, rising benefit costs, undercapitalization, mismanagement and tough competition. `` What they're suffering most from is shortsightedness and stupidity,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Boland </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Boland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healthcare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultants </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a national consulting firm for managed health plans. As much as two-thirds of all HMOs nationally reported losses in 1987, more than any other previous year, <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> said. HMOs have faced the added pressure of the evolution of preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, another three-letter plan that in many cases offers customers more flexibility, choice and accessibility than the traditional HMO, <ORGANIZATION> Boland </ORGANIZATION> said. The combined effect of financial instability and viable competition in the market made initial early growth for HMOs a short-lived phenomenon, he said. `` It really flew in the face of dynamics that are coming back to haunt them,'' <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> said. BlueLincs HMO in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> group, acquired HMO of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, Health Accord of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healthcare </ORGANIZATION> Plan _ all within four months. `` A unification of four HMOs in less than 120 days is unprecedented in this industry,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowser </PERSON>, executive vice president of BlueLincs, when announcing the last acquisition this past summer. The <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> mergers were not included in the most recent national quarterly report issued by <ORGANIZATION> InterStudy </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit research group based in <LOCATION> Excelsior </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, that studies the health maintenance industry. But the activity has not gone unnoticed, said senior <ORGANIZATION> InterStudy </ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>. `` There's certainly a trend toward consolidation nationally,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. You're either going to have to grow or you're going to have to go with a larger plan.'' In 1985, <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> began to be recognized by health care experts as an example of the growth and expansion of HMOs across the country. In that year, 11 plans were offered in the city of 380,000. `` Few medical markets outside <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> are as highly competitive, and it's doubtful any became so as fast,'' wrote <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, senior associate editor of <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, in the May 1985 issue of the national health industry magazine. In 1985, there were 480 HMO plans nationwide with 21 million members. The number of plans and participants had grown steadily since 1981, with the largest increase in plans and enrollment in 1985. `` We set up a situation where it was pretty easy to get into the HMO business,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. `` But it's not very easy to stay in. It's a tough business.'' `` HMOs that succeed will have excellent management, will be diversified, and may or may not be legally constituted as HMOs,'' she states in a report on the future of the industry. With the termination of Physicians Health Plan of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, only three plans remain in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, serving nearly 90,000 clients. Nationally, 15 health plans -LRB- not including those merged in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> -RRB- were terminated, merged or acquired by another group in the first quarter of 1988, according to <ORGANIZATION> InterStudy </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said national studies indicate a decrease in growth in the HMO industry with fewer new plans started and a drop in enrollment growth. Last year was the first year since 1981 that enrollment did not increase from the previous year, and the first quarter of 1988 shows a decrease in the number of plans, according to <ORGANIZATION> InterStudy </ORGANIZATION>'s statistics. As of March, there were 648 HMOs in the country serving 31 million members, an increase of 1.7 million clients since the previous quarter, Ms. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. The growth seemed to peak in June 1987 with 662 plans serving just under 29 million members, she said. `` There's no question that the growth rate is slowing. But it's hardly a dying industry when you see 1.7 million new members,'' she said `` What we see now is the number of new plans is balanced with the number of merged plans.''

<HEAD>Bahrain Hopes Stock Exchange Will Be Gulf's Wall Street</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> is to have its first stock exchange by the end of the year and officials hope it will become the Wall Street of the oil-rich gulf region. Initially, 28 Bahraini companies will be listed for trading, with an aggregate capital of about $ 1.8 billion. Efforts are under way to attract business from neighboring Arab countries as a new commercial confidence in the gulf emerges in the region with the cease-fire in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. The first stage will be limited to regulating and channeling existing share dealings, mainly person-to-person, in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. Officials said the regulations are still being formulated. But they noted that the financial records of all companies will be scrutinized and the exchange's board of directors will regularly review ceilings for share movements. Despite the low-key beginning, businessmen believe it wo n't be long before the small chamber at the end of <LOCATION> Manama </LOCATION>'s main banking street flourishes into a bustling bourse in a region that sits on one-third of the world's oil reserves. There is no fixed timetable for developing the exchange, which officials hope will become the financial nerve center of the region. Bahraini, gulf and international listings will be added over the next five to 10 years. The man tapped to be its director general is banking on an even faster pace. `` Ten years is a long time ... We hope to have that status before then. Hopefully we can be recognized internationally before long,'' said <PERSON> Fawzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Behzad </PERSON>, adviser to the nine-member board. He holds a doctorate from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, earned in 1984 with a thesis entitled `` Prototype for the <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> Stock Market.'' Although the scale of gulf investment in the new exchange is not yet clear, <LOCATION> Bahraini </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> cited some key advantages. `` I believe the gulf is a prime region for investors _ no taxes, no exchange problems,'' he said. <PERSON> Behzad </PERSON> noted that the British government's order to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to reduce its holdings in the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was a timely reminder to gulf investors to look to their own region rather than abroad. `` The scope for investment aboard is subject to the laws of those countries ... Crises and annoyances on the world market are no doubt positive elements in enhancing chances of capital rushing back to the domestic market,'' he said. Gulf states have invested billions of petrodollars harvested from the 1970s oil boom abroad. Strapped by the collapse of oil prices, gulf governments want national stock exchanges and eventually a regional capital market to attract back billions of dollars held overseas by the private sector. Luring that money back may not be so easy, considering the recent track record for equity markets in the region. Six years ago, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s unofficial Souk al-Manakh stock market crashed under the weight of $ 94 billion of post-dated `` paper checks.'' Many investors were badly hurt. Abdulnabi al-Sho ` ala, a leading businessman and member of the board of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> crash was part of a `` chain reaction'' to the recession that has gripped the region since the Iran-Iraq war broke out in September The recession was fueled by a downturn in oil prices that began in 1982, the fluctuating dollar and a general stock market slump. `` Building people's confidence is n't easy. Lots of people suffered through dealing in shares,'' Sho'ala said. With dozens of offshore banks and financial institutions, and traditionally the region's services center, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> sees itself as the natural financial heart of the gulf. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, recovering from al-Manakh, is fast developing its infant official exchange. <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> plans a small market this year, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> says its turn will come soon. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is cautiously fostering a dealings center and encouraging public issues by major firms. <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> is linked to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> through the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an economic and defense alliance. Economist <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Azzam </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, has estimated that there is some $ 150 billion of gulf money invested abroad, against $ 50 billion in the <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION> governments, said in a recent study that `` a collective <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION> stock market will polarize $ 320 billion in <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION> petrodollars estimated to have been invested abroad.'' During the oil boom, when there was so much money around, there was no need to mobilize liquidity. But in the early 1980s, governments started suffering shortages of capital and sought to beef up non-oil revenue. Financiers stressed the need to broaden <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s capital market and to integrate with the GCC. In theory, <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION> nationals can already buy up to 25 percent of shares in a <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION> company elsewhere, but some governments have acted to restrict that. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, for example, bans non-citizens holding stakes in its banks. `` Every -LRB- GCC -RRB- government has been talking about a larger role for the private sector. If they want the savings in private hands, they have to open channels for them,'' said <PERSON> Azzam </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> says it plans to drill an exploratory oil and gas well this winter from an ice island in the <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Construction of the island and an ice road connecting it to shore is expected to begin in mid-December, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> permit application said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s exploration manager, said Monday that drilling of the Karluk prospect would be finished by May 1 to allow removal of all equipment before breakup. The prospect is about eight miles east of the <LOCATION> Endicott </LOCATION> oil field operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. It is inside the barrier islands, on a state lease <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> acquired in 1979 in the joint state-federal <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> lease sale. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> has been interested in the area for quite awhile, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. He said the company drilled a well on <PERSON> Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON>, about four mile north of the new prospect, several years ago. The well will be <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s first since 1986, when it teamed with Standard on the only well drilled to date in the coastal plain of the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said there is no particular reason the company has planned the well for this winter, other than that it is a prospect <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> identified some time ago. State oil and gas officials said the 10-year lease on the prospect is about to expire and speculated that might be <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s primary reason for drilling this year The company is planning an ice island that is about 1,000 feet in diameter and about 50 feet thick.

 <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudas </PERSON> began a stockbroker training program with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 19, 1987, the day infamously recalled as Black Monday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average plummeted 508 points. What's worse, <PERSON> Dudas </PERSON> began practicing his new profession on Nov. 13, a Friday. Foreboding signs and the hard reality of the crash aside, <PERSON> Dudas </PERSON>, like some of the brokers who have made their debuts within the last year, has used the crash to his advantage. <PERSON> Dudas </PERSON>, 29, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot, said prospective clients were initially hesitant to commit to a new broker in the wake of the crash, but were anxious to talk. `` I have people who have had brokers for years and are dealing with me and one of the things they know is ... that their brokers did n't call them Oct. 19 or the weeks following,'' said <PERSON> Dudas </PERSON>, who works at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. A number of those brokers, even some who did call their clients on the day of the crash, might now be unemployed or in another line of work Over 12,000 workers in the securities business _ including brokers, floor traders, clerks and secretaries _ lost jobs as a result of the crash of a year ago, according to some estimates. A survey by the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a state regulatory agency, shows approximately two out of three investors say their problems stemming from the crash have not been resolved. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASAA </ORGANIZATION>'s president, said the survey indicated one out of seven small investors said they have left the market completely or were holding less than $ 500 in stocks. Once known for their ability to grab new customers with a daily round of cold calls, young brokers joining the fold since the crash seem to be working harder than ever at getting to know their clients. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>, a broker for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman-Hutton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> since late 1987, said good brokering is not purely transactional. `` You're not just calling a person and saying, ` Look, I have this great stock. You ought to buy it,' and you do n't know anything about the person.'' Chin, 42, meets with his clients a few times before deciding where to distribute their investments. Recently, a client asked Chin to invest his $ 1 million portfolio in equities. Realizing his expertise at that point was limited, <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> gave part of the responsibility and commission to other <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> money managers whose performance he monitors. `` It's not a matter of maxing out commissions, but doing the right thing for the client,'' <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON>, a 25-year-old financial consultant for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compares the role of the post-crash broker to that of a physician `` You ca n't just walk into a doctor's office and be prescribed a medicine,'' <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> said. `` You have to get to know the history and then start making recommendations.'' Partly in response to the bottom falling out last year, <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> made the transition from municipal bond seller to full-service broker. During the bull market people were eager to hear a stock idea right off the bat, <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> said. But since the crash, `` people adjusted their thinking and want to talk about our overall ideas,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> has taken the consultative approach for years, according to <PERSON> Spector </PERSON>, but now the clients have come to expect it. When <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> is convinced that a person she has cold-called is already under good financial care by another broker, she usually does not try to pursue the business. But many new brokers find that success is still based on a numbers game. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s Chin works a 55-hour week and recently broke the 200 mark in his clientele. New brokers are required to attain 40 new clients with investments of at least $ 10,000 each in their first six months, according to Chin. `` I blew it away,'' <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> said of the minimum. The company sounds just as ambitious about the future of the brokering business. Spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> enrolled 900 in its training program for 1988, up slightly from 853 in 1987. `` We have a long-term commitment to retail investors, even though individual investment is down this year,'' he said. For <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dudas </PERSON>, the challenge lies in holding on to new business. Nothing can compete with landing aboard a jet carrier at night, the ex-aviator said reflectively, but `` I've lost more sleep for my clients than I ever did after I came back from a bad landing in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.''

 Scottish & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breweries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will paste its labels upside down on 36 million bottles of its <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ale </ORGANIZATION> to protest an Australian takeover bid. A special `` hands off'' message _ yet to be written _ will be pasted onto the back of 24 million of those bottles, brewery spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrington </PERSON> said. `` We sell <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> to 30 different countries so we expect this message will soon find its way to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Merrington </PERSON>, head of the brewery's public affairs department. Australian brewing company <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IXL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> launched a takeover bid Monday for the Scottish-based beverage company, valuing it at $ 2.8 billion. Scottish & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> promptly rejected the offer, calling it `` totally unwelcome and unacceptable.'' <PERSON> Merrington </PERSON> said, `` The aim of the upside down labels is to demonstrate a thumbs down to Elders.'' Three million of the bottles will be distributed nationally by the end of the week and another nine million by the end of the month, he said. <PERSON> Merrington </PERSON> said the takeover proposal should be referred to the government's Monopolies and <ORGANIZATION> Merger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that S & amp; N's profit of $ 197 million in its latest fiscal year was up 25 percent over the previous year. The company employs 24,000 workers. Scottish & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> rejected a merger proposal from Elders last summer. Elders, through its <ORGANIZATION> Courage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, is offering $ 6.96 a share in cash for Scottish brewery.

<HEAD>Hercules Introduces New Packaging Technology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hercules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday introduced a new film-packaging technology that it claimed will double the shelf life of fresh produce. <PERSON> Hercules </PERSON> said its new `` FreshHold'' package system controls the atmosphere inside packages, thereby keeping produce fresh longer and preserving its appearance, taste and color. Hercules, a chemical and aerospace company based in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, said it took five years to develop the packaging. `` The key element is a breathable film that allows fresh produce to continue breathing after packing,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Hercules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polymers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. `` This breathable film regulates the rate at which oxygen and carbon dioxide enter and leave the package.'' An initial venture involving broccoli has been successful, <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> said. FreshHold packaging has been test-marketed at supermarkets in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Cauliflower, strawberries, celery, carrots, lettuce and pineapple will be available with the new packaging next year, the company said. While packaged produce now makes up only 3 percent of the billion-dollar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> produce market, many companies are working on similar concepts to extend shelf life, experts say. The new product also will reduce the amount of ice needed to transport produce across the country. The FreshHold packaging also has some drawbacks, according to experts. The lunglike membrane on top of the film has to be custom designed to the respiration rate of each type of produce held in the box, and it requires good refrigeration for optimum performance. In addition, consumers must be convinced that pre-cut fruits and vegetables are as fresh as those they can choose themselves from the produce bin, the experts say. The produce packaged in FreshHold sells for slightly more than unpackaged fruits and vegetables.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>, a prolific theorist whose ideas on balancing supply and demand helped rebuild the French economy after World War II, won the Nobel Prize for economics Tuesday. <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> shopkeeper's son, became mentor to a generation of economists. He developed formulas to enable large enterprises, particularly public ones, to keep an economy in balance by regulating prices and allocating their resources. After the award was announced, the 77-year-old economist said he had given up hope of ever winning the prize, which was established 20 years ago. `` I've been mentioned so many times before, I just did n't think I would get it,'' he said at from apartment in a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> suburb. The poverty and unemployment <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> saw in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, on a visit during the Great Depression of the 1930s, turned him to economics from the engineering career for which he had trained. `` He is a giant in economic theoretic analysis,'' said <PERSON> Assar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindbeck </PERSON>, who heads the committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> that awards the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science. `` He's been under consideration for a long time,'' <PERSON> Lindbeck </PERSON> said. `` It took a long time to investigate him because of the great volume and complexity of his works.'' According to the citation, <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> was honored `` for his pioneering contributions to the theory of markets and efficient utilization of resources.'' This year's prizes are worth about $ 390,000. <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> is the first <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> national to win the economics award, according to the official list, but 1983 laureate <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Debreu </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was born in <LOCATION> Calais </LOCATION>. He was a student of <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>. <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> did his major work in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> during the war. He published `` In Search of an Economic Discipline'' in 1943 and `` Economy and Interest'' in 1947. Of his change in careers, the laureate said Tuesday: `` My motivation when I was young was an idea of being able to improve the conditions of life, to try to find a remedy to many of the problems facing the world. That's what led me into economics. I saw it as a way of helping people.'' <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` He was the mentor for everyone involved in the economy in postwar <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> between 1945 and 1968, all the people who were in charge of the biggest enterprises and of the state planning apparatus.'' <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> taught at <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>'s institution until his retirement nine years ago, and is not widely known outside <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. He has continued research and writing. His theories are expressed in complicated mathematical formulas. They form the basis for sorting out the thousands of independent factors involved in marketing goods and services: How much should a train ticket cost, for example, or what is the right price for a kilowatt-hour of electricity? <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said the idea is to keep supply and demand in balance, and according to the <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> theories, `` it's the government's role to organize this fair competition.'' The academy said the French economist's work, in some ways, parallels that of earlier Nobel laureates <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> says he is not from any mold. `` If you will permit me, I do n't fit into any category except my own,'' he declared Tuesday. `` I am not a monetarist and I am not a Keynesian. On certain points I agree with each.'' <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON> was once quoted as saying a generation of economic theory would have taken a different course if <PERSON> Allais </PERSON>' earliest writings had been in English. Americans have dominated the prize. Fifteen Americans are among the 25 economics laureates and five are British. <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> has published constantly since the war and has at least 36 titles to his credit, including works on history and physics.

 The stock market was mixed in late trading today, after seesawing gently through much of the trading session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 3.02 points at 2,137.45 at 3 p.m. EDT. The closely watched barometer was dragged down by a steep decline in <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> stock, one of its components, and analysts said the average would otherwise have been higher. In the broader market, advancing issues almost evenly matched declining ones, with 674 issues higher, 672 lower and 575 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 125.78 million shares. Analysts said most of the action continued to center around issues of major food companies involved in new takeover bids. `` Other than that, the market's been mixed,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandenberg </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Market watchers also noted some underlying uneasiness in advance of Wednesday's one-year anniversary of the October stock market collapse <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> stock had shot up 28 \ a share to 88 -RRB- in heavy trading, just below the $ 90 a share offered late Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> in an $ 11 billion takeover offer <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> stock had dropped 5 -LCB- to 94 -LCB-, apparently because investors felt the acquisition would dilute the earnings of the cigarette and food giant. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said it has filed suit against <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> and certain of its directors in an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> court.

 Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting the weak tone of the grain export business. Soybeans swung in a range from $ 8.04 to $ 8.16 a bushel.

 A group of companies allied with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> raised the stakes Tuesday in a battle with other computer giants over control of Unix, a base layer of software that makes it easier for different brands of computers to work together. By banding together, the big computer makers gained more bargaining power in the contest with the <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a group that includes <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Unix is portrayed by enthusiasts as a great hope of the computer industry because it would allow programs to run on a wide variety of computers without expensive alteration However, the struggle over Unix has soured computer buyers, who fear the standard is being split in two. Programs written to work with one version of Unix might not run on computers that use another version. Both sides in the contest say they want to unify Unix, but the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION> insists that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's Unix System V Release 4.0 should serve as the basis, while the Open Software Foundation says <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s version, <LOCATION> AIX </LOCATION>, should be the core The <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION> scored a small victory when the <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> indicated Tuesday that there might be room for compromise. Until now it has made its insistence on <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s AIX a non-negotiable point. `` Nothing has changed on that right now,'' <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> said. `` But that does n't mean the world ca n't change tomorrow. Please bear with us.'' A meeting between AT & amp; T and the <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled for later in the week, probably Friday, <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> said. The new group rallying around <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's version of Unix is made up of 18 companies, including giants such as <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Ing. <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co..

But supporters of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's version of Unix, known as System V Release 4.0, say <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has taken steps to ensure that other companies and customers have a big say in the development of Unix. `` What <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has done is resolve those issues,'' <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindelow </PERSON>, senior vice president for marketing and services at <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> labor officials said Tuesday they are hopeful there will be other suitors for the carrier, from which financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has reportedly backed away. `` We'll just keep moving along,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of the Machinists District 100, said before leaving Tuesday for out-of-town meetings concerning Eastern. `` We're confident that we will still get something worked out. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that `` the talks are over.'' `` It's unfortunate because a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would have been very positive for <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. But what will be will be,'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was quoted in Tuesday's editions. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> reportedly notified <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, on Monday that he was unable to reach an understanding with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s three unions over the weekend. But with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> continuing to lose money and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> stalemated in efforts to extract concessions from its unions, Wall Street analysts and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> labor officials think he wants to sell. `` I do n't think there's any question that his advisers and lenders have advised him that his crusade against labor is going to drag the whole <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> down the tubes,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> local. `` I think he has realized the only way out is to sell.'' However, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, quoting an unidentified source, said Tuesday there were no other active offers for Eastern and that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is planning to keep the airline. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> had been negotiating for more than a week with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilot and machinist unions, although <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> never made a specific acquisition proposal. Last Wednesday, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> agreed to buy the Eastern shuttle for $ 365 million in cash. Sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that the union talks broke down mainly because <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was seeking wage concessions from the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions that the union leaders considered too severe. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> `` got too greedy,'' one union source told the Journal. The newspaper also reported that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> negotiators became angry when <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union tried to tie its forthcoming contract negoiations with the talks with Eastern. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> reportedly had given <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> an exclusive right until the end of the week to make an offer for Eastern to the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> board of directors. After that deadline, other interested parties could come forward with offers. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> executives have indicated that money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, minus its Northeast shuttle, would be worth about $ 1 billion, according to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, other parties that have expressed an interest in buying the rest of Eastern include <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Corr </PERSON>, who is a close associate of <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, and a group of major insurance companies, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. Eastern has racked up losses of more than $ 302.5 million since 1987. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> announced on Monday an unusual peak-season cut in MaxSaver fares between <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and northeast cities. `` Never before has <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> offered such deep discounts so far ahead of the peak winter travel season,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s newly named vice president for marketing. Fares will range from $ 69 one way to $ 89 depending on destination. Fares between <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, for example, are $ 79 each way. That's 33 percent off the normal restricted MaxSavers fares and 70 percent or more off regular coach prices. Roundtrip tickets must be purchased 24 hours after a reservation is made and are nonrefundable. They must be bought by Oct. 31 for trips beginning Nov. 1 through Feb. 15. A Saturday night stayover is required. The new rates, announced Monday, involve 16 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities and 40 northern destinations. The rates through the winter season, a peak travel time to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> from the northeast, exempts Nov. 23, 27, and 28; Dec. 22 and 23, and Jan. 2 and 3 from the cut-rate fares.

 <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reported sharp declines in their third-quarter profits while another large banking concern, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, posted significantly higher earnings during the same period. But all three companies were ahead for the first three quarters of the year following losses a year ago, when they added to their loan-loss provisions to cover troubled Third World debt. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest bank holding company, said that net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $ 394 million, or $ 1.13 per share, down 25 percent from earnings of $ 528 million, or $ 1.78 a share, in 1987. For the first nine months, the company's profit totaled $ 1.11 billion, or $ 3.17 a share, vs. a $ 1.8 billion loss a year ago. No. 7-ranked Manufacturers Hanover said it earned $ 197.7 million, or $ 3.77 a share, in the third quarter. That was 53 percent higher than net income of $ 129.1 million, or $ 2.73 a share, in 1987. Hanover's nine-month earnings totaled $ 741.2 million, or $ 14.28 a share, compared with a $ 1.1 billion loss last year. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON>, ranked 10th, reported quarterly income of $ 131.7 million, or $ 2.36 per share, down 15 percent from earnings of $ 155 million, or $ 2.77 per share, in the year-ago period. Net income for the first nine months of was $ 376.6 million, or $ 6.75 per share, vs. a loss of $ 60.4 million last year. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> said its third-quarter results included an after-tax reduction in earnings of $ 22 million as a result of its decision to reclassify $ 566 million of its $ 1.4 billion in loans to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, reflecting the non-payment of interest for 90 or more days on those loans. Last year <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> increased its loan-loss provision by $ 3 billion to $ 4.1 billion. Its loan loss provision so far this year is about 78 percent lower. <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> said its third-quarter profit included an after-tax gain of $ 98 million from the sale of a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office building. Helping boost its nine-month profit were net gains of about $ 188 million from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, two branch buildings and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. The nine-month profit had been hurt a year ago by the company's decision to increase its reserve for possible credit losses by $ 1.7 billion <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> said market conditions in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where it is based, were favorable, but the reduction in quarterly earnings reflected a $ 369.3 million charge for reducing its portfolio of loans to less developed countries.

 A year ago Wednesday, the world seemed to be collapsing around <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> as he battled and screamed to keep order in three tumbling stocks. `` It was a very scary time,'' said <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a market maker on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where prices collapsed in frenzied selling on Oct. 19, 1987, put some of his colleagues out of business and severely stretched the limits of others. `` There was disbelief and certainly fear.'' He spent that night in a nearby hotel, rather than returning to his suburban <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> home, wife and teen-age daughter. What really worried him, he said, was what would happen on Oct. 20. `` Logic said it was n't going to happen again,'' he said. `` Emotion said it was.'' In an interview on the eve of the anniversary of the worst stock panic of modern times, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said the anxiety level has fallen sharply, but so has interest in stocks. Like other <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> market makers, known as `` specialists,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> is now more concerned with the absence of buyers and sellers, his bread and butter. `` Ours is a business of feast or famine. Always has been, always will be,'' the 47-year-old said in his native <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> drawl, as he leaned against his trading post on the cavernous <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> floor in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s jungle of skyscrapers. `` It's certainly closer to famine now.'' A partner in the specialist firm <ORGANIZATION> Benjamin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jacobson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> has been in the business for more than a decade. During a typical day, he buys and sells thousands of shares in <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tandem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, known on Wall Street as <ORGANIZATION> Sallie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>. As a specialist, his firm has what amounts to a franchise in these and 37 other stocks on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> floor, acting as an intermediary for buy and sell orders from brokers stationed along the floor perimeters. In return, the specialist firm is obligated to set opening prices and keep trading orderly, largely by selling from its own inventory when other sellers are scarce and buying when buyers are scarce. On Black Monday, Oct. 19, and its volatile aftermath, a marauding avalanche of sellers threatened to overwhelm the ability of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s 54 specialist firms to do their jobs. Many were reluctant to buy stocks because they were uncertain whether other buyers would appear. Others who had spent enormous amounts of borrowed money to buy stocks faced credit crises with their banks. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>'s firm, one of Wall Street's strongest, traded more than $ 1 billion in securities during the week of the crash. The performance of the specialists was criticized in some post-crash studies, which called them a weakness in a system that experienced unprecedented strain. But <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> defended what he called the fairest and most efficient market system, even in the face of new technologies that have replaced many of the trading functions once performed by humans. `` If you ask how the specialists did on Black Monday, you'd get a different answer from every one,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. `` Some went out of business, some made bad mistakes. But one has to understand what a specialist does. `` We are a pricing mechanism. We're not here to buy every stock for sale,'' he said. `` What we're here to do is make sure it's done in an an orderly fashion. We could have done everything right and the market could still have come down.'' Computers can speed the delivery of buy and sell orders to the trading floor, he said, but the auction process, the bargaining and haggling that inevitably becomes part of securities trading, will always be a human domain. `` You ca n't automate the interface of brokers,'' he contended. `` You ca n't black box that.'' On the day before the anniversary, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> floor was relatively quiet, and few people were talking about the crash. `` It's history,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garlinge </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> colleague who trades <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock In the first hour, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> traded a few thousand shares of <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> with floor brokers and the price moved up | point _ or 62 -LCB- cents a share to $ 33.50. A blue-coated <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> reporter, who conveys all trades into a computer system that feeds the exchange's electronic ticker tape, dutifully recorded the transactions `` This is slow,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. The biggest action was a few trading posts away at <ORGANIZATION> Stokes </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoyt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the specialist firm for <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, where brokers were screaming to sell because the stock was up nearly $ 30 a share on a $ 90-a-share takeover offer by <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc.. Several specialists watching from afar shook their heads in To them, takeovers are bad news because the acquired company's stock will no longer be traded. `` It's a product that we lose,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, another partner in the <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> firm. `` It's very tough to lose a company.''

 The dollar finished higher against most major currencies Tuesday after a choppy day of trading in the foreign exchange markets. Gold prices fell in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In late trading, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 410.70 a troy ounce, down from $ 411.90 a troy ounce late Monday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency began the day on the upswing in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, buoyed by comments in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> governor <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Larosiere </PERSON> who reiterated support for central bank intervention to achieve exchange rate stability. The dollar then headed lower in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before turning up again in domestic trading. Analysts said that despite the appearance of volatility, the dollar was stuck in the same narrow range it has been trading in since spring, between 1.80 and 1.90 West German marks. `` All we're seeing is the low end of the same range,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It will continue to do that until the election.'' Those following the dollar generally agreed that any drastic moves up or down were unlikely before the presidential election is decided next month. Smaller moves within the established trading range are possible, they said. Indeed, some technical analysts attributed the move upward at the end of day Tuesday to a bounce off the low end of the trading range. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the trading day begins, the dollar rose to 127.70 yen from Monday's 127.20 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it slipped to 127.05 yen. Late in the day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar moved to 127.155, up from 127.065 late Monday. The dollar gained against the pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where it cost $ 1.7515 to buy one pound, cheaper than the $ 1.7530 it cost late Monday. But in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fetched $ 1.74805, up from $ 1.74635 late Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Monday, were 1.81125 West German marks, up from 1.80875; 1.52925 Swiss francs, up from 1.52745; 1.20075 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20375; 6.1675 French francs, down from 6.1710; and 1,346.50 Italian lire, unchanged.

On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 411.80 a troy ounce, down from $ 412.20 an ounce Monday. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 412.95 a troy ounce, compared with late Monday's $ 412.25 an ounce.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Resume Climb On Tight Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices climbed sharply Tuesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid renewed fears of tight supplies linked partly to a miners' strike in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, the world's seventh largest copper producer On other futures markets, precious metals were slightly lower; most energy futures fell sharply; cattle posted steep while pork futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; and stock-index futures advanced. Reports that as many as half of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 70,000 metals miners were out on strike fueled a late rally in the copper market, analysts said. The contracts for both spot and December delivery hit new life-of-contract highs for the 10th time in the past 12 sessions. Copper for spot delivery settled at $ 1.38 a pound, up 3.9 cents from Monday while the contract for delivery in December rose 3.2 cents to $ 1.246 a pound. The market opened steady and traded on a fairly even keel for most the session in light of Monday's report that <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> stocks had fallen last week by 4,550 metric tons instead of the 7,000-to-9 ,000 - ton decline that had been expected, Nevertheless, `` LME stocks continued their down trend and probably will continue to decline,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Demler </PERSON>, metals economist with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Inventories are critically low, consumption remains good in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, parts of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and production has faltered a bit as of late,'' he said. `` The only thing that's negative in the copper market right now is that it's due for a technical correction _ it's moved up much too fast,'' <PERSON> Demler </PERSON> said. `` But most most of the fundamentals suggest the market will be tight for another five to six months.'' Gold and silver futures retreated slightly in reaction to a reversal of recent trends toward a weaker dollar and lower prices for crude oil and other commodities, <PERSON> Demler </PERSON> said. Gold settled $ 2 to $ 4 lower with December at $ 415.10 troy ounce; silver was 5 cents lower across the board with December at $ 6.425 a troy ounce. Crude oil futures plunged on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid heavy profit-taking but market players still believes <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members will reach agreement soon on a plan to stabilize prices, analysts said. `` The market was overbought and a lot of people wanted to take profits,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 60 cents to 67 cents lower with November at $ 14.61 a barrel; heating oil was 1.59 cents to 1.79 cents lower with November at 42.29 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1 cent lower to .16 cent higher with November at 46.92 cents a gallon. Cattle futures prices fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on profit-taking following Monday's advance to life-of-contract highs for all delivery months, analysts said. The cattle market had rallied on expectations for higher cash markets and ideas that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s quarterly cattle-on-feed report, due out after the close on Friday, will show a significant reduction in the number of cattle being fattened for slaughter. Live cattle settled .35 cent to 1.15 cents lower with October at 72.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to 1.07 cents lower with October at 81.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent lower to .25 cent higher with October at 39.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .18 cent to .57 cent lower with February at 48.77 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures finished mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting the weak tone of the grain export business, analysts said. Corn harvesting was 63 percent complete as of Sunday in the top 17 producing states while soybean harvesting was 90 percent finished in the top 19 producing states, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said late Monday. Wheat settled 1 cent to 7 \ cents lower with December at $ 4.23 a bushel; corn was 2 -RCB- cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at $ 2.92 \ a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.57 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 5 -LCB- cents lower with November at $ 8.05 -LCB- a Stock-index futures posted strong gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 2.95 points higher at

 A late rally catapulted the stock market Tuesday to its highest close since last October's crash, as Wall Street overcame its jitters on the eve of the debacle's one-year anniversary. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 19.38 points to 2,159.85, scoring most of the gain in the waning minutes of the session. The blue-chip average brushed past the previous post-crash high of 2,158.96 reached on Columbus Day, Oct. 10. The crash anniversary `` has probably got some people a little uneasy,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Raftery </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` People should look beyond it; the world is n't coming to an end. Tuesday's post-crash peak was still 21 percent below the all-time high of 2,722.42 reached on Aug. 25, 1987. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8-to-5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 841 issues up, 568 down and 546 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> totaled 162.5 million shares, up from 119.29 million in Monday's session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 191.79 million shares. Stocks spent most of the session seesawing gently between the plus and minus columns, until the late buying spree. The rally was fueled by takeover activity involving several big food companies, which gave the market support throughout the day. `` There's just rampant takeover speculation going on,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, a partner in the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hummer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> stock shot up 28 -LRB- a share to 88 \ in heavy trading, just below the $ 90 a share offered late Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> in an $ 11 billion takeover offer <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> stock dropped 4 -LCB- to 95 -LCB-, apparently because investors felt the acquisition would dilute the earnings of the cigarette and food giant. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said it has filed suit against <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> and some of its directors in an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> court.

<HEAD>Tobacco Companies Agree To Put Warnings On Products</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Cigar </PERSON> and pipe tobacco manufacturers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have decided to put cancer warnings on their products rather than fight a lawsuit that could have resulted in thousands of dollars in fines. The manufacturers already were losing money in sales because a chain of stores refused to stock their products and others threatened to follow suit. The lawsuit was filed, and some products removed, after the manufacturers failed to comply with Proposition 65, a toxins initiative passed by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters in 1986. The initiative requires businesses to provide `` clear and reasonable'' warnings to consumers exposed to chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects. `` The tobacco manufacturers were very eager to settle and do the right thing,'' said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, a spokesman for state Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>. The manufacturers made the decision Monday. But on Tuesday, cigars and pipe tobacco were still absent from the shelves of <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> supermarkets, the 345-market statewide chain that became the first supermarket company to announce it would pull the products from it shelves. `` The shelves are still empty; <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> has not seen a copy of the agreement,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. She said the grocery company would withhold comment on the agreement until it had been reviewed. Under the settlement, companies will begin placing warning labels on cigars and pipe tobacco. The state has agreed to waive the fines of $ 2,500 a day it had threatened to place on every pack of cigars or other tobacco products that did not contain such warnings. Since passage of Proposition 65, there have been several court fights over which substances should be classified as toxic. Cigarettes, chewing tobacco and snuff all carry federally mandated warnings. `` We want to make it clear that we have been in compliance -LRB- with federal warning laws -RRB- for a year and a half. We are not part of the lawsuit,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Smokeless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The institute represents makers of snuff and chewing tobacco. Close said the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> agency said in a July 1 letter that the warnings on snuff and chewing tobacco `` are consistent with the spirit and intended effect'' of Proposition 65. `` Although labeling is burdensome, the manufacturers preferred to avoid lengthy and costly litigation,'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, president of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Cigar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement. Most cigar products sold nationally will bear the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> warning because it would be impossible to label only those sold in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said. The lawsuit, filed Sept. 30, prompted at least eight retailers and 25 tobacco companies to agree to the warnings. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> filed the lawsuit about two months after environmental groups said they would seek $ 1.3 billion in fines from stores and manufacturers for violating the Proposition 65 warning requirement. After <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> announcement of Oct. 4, <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, with 343 markets across the state, followed by giving tobacco makers 30 days to label their products or have them removed from Lucky's stores. <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates 221 stores in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, has posted its own warning signs near cigar, pipe and chewing tobacco displays. The company also told tobacco manufacturers that it would no longer accept shipments of products without labels after Monday.

<HEAD>Delaware Supreme Court Agrees to Hear Appeal on Macmillan-Kohlberg
Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The five-month-old takeover fight for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was put on hold Tuesday for at least two weeks as a result of court action in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed to hear British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s appeal of a lower court ruling relating to <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s merger agreement with a rival suitor and set oral arguments for Nov. 2. The publishing giant has agreed to be acquired in a leveraged buyout for $ 2.5 billion by a group led by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and including <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> senior management. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> has offered $ 2.51 billion for <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> under certain conditions through his <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier in the day, the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> issued a preliminary injunction preventing the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> group from completing its tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s stock until <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> could appeal. That order will apparently remain in effect until after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> issues a decision in the case. `` Nothing can happen until November. Neither side can change their offer. The status quo is maintained,'' said <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It does n't come as a surprise,'' said a top <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> financial adviser, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirie </PERSON>. `` This is a major case under <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law and I would have been surprised if the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had n't agreed to hear it.'' The court action in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, came a day after Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> refused to grant a preliminary injunction requested by <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> against a `` lock-up'' provision that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> granted <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION>. The provision would give <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> the right to buy four of <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s businesses for about $ 865 million if its merger agreement fell through. Under the merger pact, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $ 90.05 a share in cash and securities for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, who is determined to make his company one of the world's biggest communications concerns, has offered $ 90.25 in cash for each of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s 27.8 million shares provided that, among other things, the lock-up provision is eliminated. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> contends the lock-up provision is unfair and would leave the company with a $ 250 million tax liability. He has said he would drop his tender offer if he were allowed to buy the same four businesses for $ 900 million. They include the Berlitz language centers, the directory division, the direct marketing division and a division that publishes state legal codes. The fight for <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> has been underway since mid-May when a group led by the wealthy <PERSON> Texan </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> proposed acquiring the company for $ 64 a share. The Bass group has since dropped out of the bidding. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> fell 50 cents a share to $ 88.25.

 Small business growth has remained healthy after the stock market crash a year ago, with sales and employment gains outpacing those of larger corporations, according to an economic index reported Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its Small Business Growth Index rose sharply in the first half of 1988, to 4.46 from 1.48 for the previous six months. The strongest gains were in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, which recovered quickly from the Oct. 19 stock market plunge, which occured a year ago Wednesday. `` ... The dramatic increase in the Growth Index reflects an overall resiliency within the small business sector,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> who is co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>. The index measures the semi-annual growth in employment, sales and new incorporations of some 7 million small companies _ defined as those with 100 or fewer employees. The index found that small business employment rose 1.97 percent and sales grew 1.3 percent in the first half of this year, compared with a 1.90 percent jobs gain and 1.06 percent sales rise in the second half of 1987. New incorporations remained steady. While small business sales and employment growth outpaced similar rates for large business, the gap between the two narrowed in the first six months of this year, the report said. In the last half of 1987, small business sales grew at a rate 8.2 times those of large business, but in the first half of 1988, the rate narrowed to 3.7 times, the report said. `` Large business cutbacks, prevalent throughout the 1980s, appear to have bottomed out,'' said <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>. `` Additionally, large business employment is now accelerating and sales growth, almost nonexistent last year, is beginning to rise to the level of high-performing small business.'' The weakest growth area for small business was in the <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> region, where sales dropped 2.35 percent and employment edged up 1.31 percent. This was the only area showing a negative indicator, the report said. The biggest turnaround came in the region that includes <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> where overall sales, employment and new incorporations grew 1.03 percent after a 3.94 drop the previous six months. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> ranked first for employment growth at 2.33 percent, while the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> states led in sales growth with a rise of 2.72 percent, the report said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> passengers are not shying away from in-flight meals despite a link between food served aboard some flights and the outbreak of an intestinal illness, an airline spokesman said Tuesday. `` We have n't had any reports of any problems,'' said <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. `` Can I say that nobody has turned -LRB- airline food -RRB- down? No, I ca n't tell you that. But we have n't heard of anything major.'' Shigellosis has been confirmed in passengers on nine flights from Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to seven cities: <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> In addition, there was a confirmed case on an in-bound flight from <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said Tuesday that possible cases of the illness have been identified by the department on about 145 flights since Sept. 15, including flights overseas to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. State epidemiologist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Osterholm </PERSON> said Monday it's still not clear whether food now being served on <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> flights is safe and <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said Tuesday that the situation had not changed. `` I ca n't confirm that it is safe and I ca n't say it is n't,'' <PERSON> Osterholm </PERSON> said. Confirmed cases of the illness have been found among passengers who flew on the airline as late as last Thursday, <PERSON> Osterholm </PERSON> said. All the confirmed cases have been traced to food prepared for the airline at the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> kitchen, which services <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport That facility serves <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> exclusively and prepares 100,000 meals per week for more than 900 Northwest flights out of the Twin Cities. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlags </PERSON>, a corporate spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that tests on the company's 360 workers should be complete by Thursday and results should be complete before the weekend is out.

<TEXT>
 After serving two years as president of troubled Burger King, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olcott </PERSON> resigned Tuesday in the fast-food company's second top management shakeup this year. The resignation comes as Burger King's parent, Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is scrambling to defend itself against an unwanted takeover bid. Analysts said it was <PERSON> Olcott </PERSON>'s failure to reverse <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s losing trend that led to his departure Under <PERSON> Olcott </PERSON>, Burger King embarked on an expensive and ultimately disappointing marketing campaign based on the slogan `` We do it like you'd do it.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Olcott </PERSON> `` was n't a marketing man when they needed a marketing man badly.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> is in the process of defending itself against an unsolicited $ 5.23 billion tender offer launched by London-based <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts speculated that <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> might opt to sell <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the world's second-largest hamburger chain, in an effort to preserve its independence. A sale could bring as much as $ 2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s board unanimously rejected Grand Met's $ 60-a-share offer Tuesday, calling it `` inadequate and not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.'' `` They're fighting the only battle they can,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The hamburger chain accounts for about one-third of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s sales and about two-thirds of its profits but has not done well recently Its pre-tax profits have decline by more than 50 percent, from $ 119.2 million in fiscal 1986 to $ 48.2 million for the year ended May 31, the company reported. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Tuesday in urging shareholders to reject Grand Met's bid that significant investments have been made to improve Burger King operations. He said improved performance is `` critical'' to the chain. <PERSON> Olcott </PERSON>'s departure marks yet another major management shakeup for the fast-food chain, which has had five chairman and eight presidents since <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> took over in 1967. Most recently, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> resigned as head of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s ailing restaurant group in June. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, was named <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s chairman. He had worked previously in mergers and acquisitions at <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, prompting financial analysts to speculate <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> might be preparing to get rid of the Miami-based restaurant chain. `` The guy's good at doing deals,'' <PERSON> McMillin </PERSON> said. `` I've got to think he's been brought in to do a deal.''
