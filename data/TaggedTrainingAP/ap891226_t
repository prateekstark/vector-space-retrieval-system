<HEAD>Living Donor Recipient Has Follow-up Operation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nation's second recipient of a liver from a living donor underwent another operation Tuesday to remove a pocket of infection from her abdomen, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a 16-month-old liver defect victim from <LOCATION> Millington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, received part of a liver Dec. 8 from her father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a dry-wall installer. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said Dr. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Emond </PERSON>, a member of the original transplant team, decided the best way to deal with the small abcess was to reopen the operation incision to drain and clear the area of infection. `` She tolerated the procedure very well, and was out of the operating room in about two hours,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, adding the infection had not been life-threatening. The spokeswoman said <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> was listed in critical but stable condition after the two-hour operation, and was expected to be transferred out of the intensive care ward within several days. Also Tuesday, <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who preceded <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> as the nation's first living-donor liver transplant recipient, had her condition upgraded to serious `` She continues to progress well,'' Ms. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> was given a `` day pass'' from the hospital to visit with her parents on Christmas Day at a <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for relatives of ailing children. <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 29, an elementary school teacher who donated part of her liver to her daughter for the Nov. 27 transplant, was released from the hospital two weeks ago. The Smiths are from <LOCATION> Schertz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> is expected to leave the hospital sometime after the first of the year if all continues to go well, according to Ms. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> suffer from biliary atresia, a usually fatal congenital defect which is the leading cause of liver transplants in children.

<TEXT>
 Millions of Christians jammed churches in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to celebrate their first Christmas in freedom after four decades of Communist rule, but their thoughts also went to the brave Romanian people. In <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and even in battle-ravaged <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, the spirit of defiance that had guided Eastern Europeans to their remarkable revolutions turned into hope for a brighter future. The change was striking in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> as people from both sides of the technically still divided city mingled freely, attending joint church services for the first time since the Berlin Wall was built 28 years ago. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Sunday began allowing visa-free travel by West Germans and thousands used the opportunity to cross to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to join relatives for a Christmas service. `` We had very good attendance this year. Many people from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> came. Now we really have a feeling of freedom,'' said <PERSON> Christiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, an East Berliner who was showing West Berliners around the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` The church gave hope during all those years when there was no hope and now we are full of hope. `` This year it was important to speak of God's message of love so that there are no acts of revenge. The church was on the side of the weak for years and now its is important not to hate those who treated us unjustly,'' she said. The pope's midnight Mass was broadcast live for the first time by East German television. In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, the cradle of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s pro-democracy movement, pastor <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Magerius </PERSON> began the service in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicholas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> by commemorating the thousands of Romanians killed and wounded in their struggle to overthrow Communist dictator <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, like in many other towns in East Europe, the church had sheltered dissidents during the years of oppressive Communist rule. In <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, hundreds of faithful came to the Mitropolia Cathedral to hear the Patriarch of the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Teocitist </PERSON> <PERSON> Arapas </PERSON>, and Christmas carols played on radio for the first time in more than 40 years. The patriarch thanked about 500 believers for coming to the service despite battles raging in the city between popular forces and die-hard <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> loyalists. `` We must thank <PERSON> God </PERSON>, who gave us freedom after 25 years of terror,'' the patriarch said, referring to the length of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s dictatorship. `` I have been waiting 40 years for this. Now I can openly go to church,'' said <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganescu </PERSON>, a dissident who spent 10 years in prison for his opposition to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> had enjoyed much more freedom than churches in other Communist countries, many people stayed by television sets Sunday night to watch Polish-born Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> celebrate Midnight Mass at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Thousands attended the midnight service at their local parishes and crowds filled churches to capacity on Christmas Day to pray and see traditional nativity scenes, which at some churches comment on the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. One, at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s St. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>'s church, showed the Holy Infant resting upon the fallen <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. In most of the vast <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, Christmas will be celebrated Jan. 7 according to the Russian Orthodox calendar. But in the three Baltic republics, where there are large populations of Roman Catholics and Protestants, Christmas was a holiday for the first time under Soviet rule. In <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> activist <PERSON> Antanas </PERSON> <PERSON> Terleskas </PERSON> said many people attended church as usual. But he said people were not especially happy, because `` the freedom of expressing religious beliefs is just an illusion we are permitted to toy with,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, radio and television broadcast the pope's mass and activists said church attendance was up. In <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, people were able to watch the pope's mass on Finnish television, which they receive easily, and for 12 hours Estonian television broadcast Christmas carols. On Christmas Eve, millions of Czechoslovaks watched Christmas Mass on an unprecedented live television broadcast. The Mass from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s 13th century Strahov Monastery was said by the Rev. <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Maly </PERSON>, who the government had banned from the priesthood for 11 years because of his human rights activities. Millions of believers jammed into churches and Cathedrals throughout the country for midnight Mass. On Christmas Day, 90-year-old Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> said Mass at the gothic <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vitus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> overlooking the city, delivering a sermon on the responsibility that freedom brings. In central <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, on the site where mass pro-democracy rallies turned the tide of Czechoslovak history last month, crowds of students gathered to sing and share the holiday at the statue of <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>'s patron saint _ good King Wenceslas.

<HEAD>100 Days Into de Klerk Presidency, Optimism Seems Contagious</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 There's still doubt whether President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> will personally oversee the end of apartheid, but his performance since his inauguration has raised hopes higher than ever for peaceful change. Even the white-run government's most militant opponents acknowledge a dramatic shift in mood since P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> quit the presidency. They say <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s conciliatory moves resulted from pressure rather than conviction, but many anti-apartheid leaders now believe _ for the first time _ that the government sincerely wants to negotiate with them. `` Exit a president named <PERSON> P.W. </PERSON>, to be replaced by one named F.W. Remarkable what a difference that one letter made,'' wrote The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper, in its year-end issue. `` Suddenly the logjam seemed to break. Good intentions twinkled around the country. ... For the first time, people of widely differing views agreed: there is hope in our land.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, a leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> freed by <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> in October, said in a remarkably optimistic Christmas message that he had reason to hope for `` relaxation of tension'' throughout <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the coming year. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> took over as acting president in mid-August after winning a power struggle with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. Even before his inauguration Sept. 20, two weeks after general elections, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> made his mark by approving the first mass anti-government marches in decades. He marks 100 days from the inauguration on Thursday. Since his inauguration, in the words of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> political writer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabricius </PERSON>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> `` has been a blur of movement, making a major announcement almost every other day, unraveling the security establishment, going some way to unbanning the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, consulting a vast spectrum of political figures.'' Among those consulted was the world's best-known political prisoner: <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The Dec. 13 meeting at de Klerk's <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> office was seen as further proof that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release is inevitable, probably before de Klerk opens the new Parliament on Feb. 1. During <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s 11 years in power, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> was depicted as a communist-led terrorist group that had no right to enter negotiations unless it formally renounced violence. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, by meeting <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and unconditionally freeing <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, has begun the process of acknowledging the guerrilla movement's legitimacy The government now says it will talk with any group committed to peaceful solutions _ the demand for renunciation of violence has been dropped. Seeking to remove obstacles to negotiations, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has ordered the abolition of whites-only beaches, proposed repeal of the law that allows segregated local facilities, and hinted that the state of emergency imposed in 1986 will be lifted. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Selfe </PERSON>, an official of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> _ despite a past reputation as a conservative _ has proven vastly different from previous <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders. `` It might even be that the man had an ideological change of heart after coming into office,'' <PERSON> Selfe </PERSON> said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has vowed to end discrimination and negotiate a new constitution that would extend political rights to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks But he remains wedded to the concept of racial groups, and his critics believe he will balk at any steps that jeopardize the power held by the 5 million whites. `` In the process -LRB- of defending white control -RRB-, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is even prepared to put apartheid in jeopardy,'' said <PERSON> Fikile </PERSON> <PERSON> Bam </PERSON>, a legal aid director in Port <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. Wrote The Weekly Mail's editor, <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Harber </PERSON>: `` By now, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has done enough to convince most people that he is sincere in wanting some form of change. ... However, few of these people are certain he has the strength or the vision to carry through even this limited vision.'' The country's most powerful black moderate, Zulu leader <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, is less skeptical. `` There are now few who do not take the state president seriously when he talks about bringing reform,'' <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> said. `` 1990 is probably the year in which the government is going to strike out in the direction of establishing justice and equality for all.'' Perhaps <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s most significant move was curbing the influence of police and army commanders. He halved mandatory military service for white men from two years to one, proposed defense spending cuts, and scrapped a bureaucratic network through which security force officers controlled black townships. `` His achievement has been to go a long way to civilianizing the country again and creating a spirit of glasnost ... as a prelude to the real challenge of thrashing out a true democracy,'' wrote <PERSON> Fabricius </PERSON>, political correspondent for The Star newspaper.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> rummaged through the ashes that had been his home and salvaged a balpeen hammer with a charred handle and a blackened pair of pliers. The two tools and the clothes on his back are what remains of his earthly possessions. Even so, the 70-year-old retired auto mechanic says he is glad <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces invaded <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and overthrew the dictatorship of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` It hurts that I've lost everything, but what are you going to do? The gringos had to do it like they did. I only wish they would have done it long ago,'' he said. He stood on blackened sheets of corrugated zinc that had been the roof of the two-story wooden apartment building, where he lived with his wife and their granddaughter. The only remnans of the building are two masonry columns that supported the communal bathrooms. <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> and his neighbors had the misfortune to live a block from the headquarters of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s command center <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tanks and rocket-firing helicopters destroyed the military headquarters before dawn Wednesday. The barrage sparked fires that raced through housing in the working class <LOCATION> Chorrillo </LOCATION> neighborhood, creating at least 20,000 refugees. `` No one has more right to speak than we do, the ones hurt most by the attack,'' said <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Camargo </PERSON>, 37, standing in front of his ruined home. <PERSON> Camargo </PERSON>, a goldsmith, is luckier than <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> in that he lived with his wife and two children in a more substantial cinderblock structure. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces evacuated the area at daybreak Wednesday, hours after the assault began. <PERSON> Camargo </PERSON> said his 4-year-old daughter was traumatized by the hours of fire and bombing, and she wakes up crying during the night. `` One single person is guilty of all this. So much death because of one man, and that man's name is <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Camargo </PERSON> when asked if he resents the invaders. Of a dozen Chorrillo residents inteviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, all applauded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action. The closest thing to criticism was voiced by taxi driver <PERSON> Bolivar </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, 32, standing in his flooded home on the ground floor of the destroyed housing block. Most of his family's possessions were wrecked or looted. He had salvaged a red cape embroidered with silver trim _ a costume that his 11-year-old daughter had worn. `` The invasion itself was correct, the form no,'' he said. `` They should have come with much more personnel to establish positions corner by corner, to prevent looting. And they could have used less shelling. A lot of people died in their sleep. Now we have to start from zero,'' he said. Hospital authorities estimated between 200 and 300 people were killed in the invasion, at least half of them civilians. Hundreds more were injured. `` It was the only way to get him -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- out,'' said <PERSON> Camargo </PERSON>. `` He could have quit and given us all the gift of a happy Christmas, not this bitter Christmas we're having.'' The perception of the Americans as liberators underscores the relationship the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have enjoyed since <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was created, through seccession from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, by President <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s gunboat diplomacy in 1903. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s currency is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and its economy has always been closely linked to the U.S.-built and jointly administered canal. The national pastime is baseball and virtually all males over 8 years old follow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> big leagues. `` Not only are we happy with the invasion. Most people here would like <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to be the 51st star on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag,'' said a middle-aged woman. <PERSON> Camargo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> and about 9,000 Chorrillo refugees are being sheltered and fed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops at <ORGANIZATION> Balboa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, two miles away. They, like a dozen others interviewed in the wasteland around the Defense Forces headquarters, appealed for reconstruction aid from the U.S.-installed government of President <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> loaded some soggy sofa cushions from his house onto his brother-in-law's pickup. `` We've suffered, but finally that corruption is ended,'' he said. `` The Panamanian people have been asking for a long time for the North Americans to intervene.''

 Just last week, doctors thought 18-year-old <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> `` Missy'' <PERSON> Goebel </PERSON> would remain in a coma for years. On Christmas Day, the <ORGANIZATION> Mead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> honors student was talking and watching as family members opened presents for her at Sacred Heart Medical Center. `` I thought the very best Christmas present I could ever get was to hear my daughter talk again,'' said <PERSON> Missy </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>. `` She gave me that gift with a week to spare. And each day she gets a little bit better.'' <PERSON> Missy </PERSON> was injured Nov. 25 in a head-on collision on Interstate 90, just west of <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Goebel </PERSON> and her 16-year-old boyfriend were in her car when they collided with a pickup truck traveling the wrong way. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> McElfish </PERSON>, the boyfriend, was treated and released. The 79-year-old driver of the pickup is now in a nursing home. A month ago, doctors, family members and friends thought <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> would die. <PERSON> Missy </PERSON> was in a coma, largely unresponsive to talking and touching by family members. On Day 19, doctors said <PERSON> Goebel </PERSON> most likely would be comatose for years. But just a few hours after doctors left her room that day, <PERSON> Missy </PERSON> spoke to her mother. Then, she asked to telephone her brother, despite her head injuries and a broken neck, clavicle, right arm and left leg. `` She's a little miracle,'' said <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Goebel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Missy </PERSON>'s mother `` She's quite an amazing girl.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Goebel </PERSON> said she welcomed the sound of <PERSON> Missy </PERSON> bickering with her younger brother, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>. `` She calls her brother a dweeb a lot,'' the mother said, adding that the siblings were close friends. `` I could n't believe it when they were in there arguing the other day. It was great.'' <PERSON> Missy </PERSON>'s struggle is far from over. The left side of her body remains paralyzed. <PERSON> Goebel </PERSON> said his daughter often slips into a `` kind of dream state'' and gets confused easily. `` She's pretty much like a rag doll,'' he said. `` But she's further along than anyone ever thought she would be.

<HEAD>Anti-Biological Weapons Legislation Making Progress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twenty years after President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> ordered the destruction of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpile of biological weapons, the federal government is on the verge of making development and possession of the weapons illegal. Although <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s directive met with little resistance and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> joined the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and 109 other countries in signing a 1972 pact to prohibit production and possession of the weapons, efforts to incorporate the treaty's provisions into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law have failed _ until this year. Scientists, defense analysts and lawmakers credit the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, the changing atmosphere for arms control agreements and the work of a freshman senator from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> who has little foreign policy background. `` If I had to pick any of the 100 senators, it would not be him, even the top 80,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> of the liberal Council for a <ORGANIZATION> Livable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> said in a recent interview. `` He was the new kid on the block.'' The kid is Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who with the help of a longtime opponent of biological and chemical weapons, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., convinced the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to support the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 In the waning hours of the congressional session on Nov. 21, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the legislatio by voice vote. House passage and presidential approval appear likely early next year. `` By approving the legislation, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has signaled the world that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is serious about controlling these abominable creations,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. By definition, biological weapons are a form of bacteria, virus, fungus or naturally occurring toxin. A biological weapon could be unleashed on an unsuspecting public by using it in a liquid to contaminate water or in an aerosol that is dropped by bomb. In 1925, the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Protocol banned the first use in war of biological and chemical weapons, but did not address the development, production, possession or transfer of the weapons. Forty-four years later, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to destroy its arsenal of biological weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> then spearheaded the fight for an international ban on production and possession of the weapons. On April 10, 1972, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, 111 countries signed the Biological Weapons Convention. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratified the treaty two years later. According to the pact, each nation must take `` any necessary measures'' to prohibit biological weapons at home. Legislation was introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over the years to include the prohibition in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, but the measures never got far. Among the problems during the 1980s, according to the legislation's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sponsor, Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, D-Wis., was the view of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` This administration is somewhat different,'' <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> said in an interview. `` During eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, candidly speaking, they were not really for this legislation. ... They felt we did n't need this.'' But with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's support for the bill and the `` tenor of the times'' for arms control legislation, said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the biological weapons bill won easy <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval after just a handful of hearings. `` It was the right time, the right place, the right bill,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. The measure's purpose is twofold. It implements the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and seeks to protect the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against the threat of biological terrorism. `` The legislation would prohibit the possession or development of germ warfare devices and authorize the punishment of those who attempt to help foreign nations acquire such weapons,'' the bill says. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> believes final congressional approval and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signature would strengthen the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' hand in demanding that all countries comply with the 1972 treaty. The administration is concerned about countries with the capability to produce biological weapons, including <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The official list remains classified.

<HEAD>US Pool Reporters in Panama: Late for the Story</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLON, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Under cloak of darkness, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> army helicopter flew the length of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> taking a pair of reporters, a photographer and a television crew to this port city. But soon after they arrived, members of the group realized that they'd missed the story. Again. Soldiers told of entering the city on Friday afternoon to the cheers of citizens who draped <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags from their balconies. They told how the local groups helped the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers round up <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists, and how deeply moving the scene had been. But more than two days after the invasion began, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military still was keeping the media away from its operations until they were over. The Pentagon news pool, created to cover American military actions in a way that would protect important operational secrecy, was still on its way to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last Wednesday when the invasion began. Arriving in the country, the pool had to cool its heels for hours inside a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> army base and found out the details of the attack the same way everyone else in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> did _ on television, based on reports from other news people already in the city. The group arrived at the battle area around Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s headquarters after the battle was over. They viewed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s private retreats after they'd been disturbed by military investigators, and saw people who had been rescued, but not the rescue itself. After a while, the pool members decided their motto should be `` semper tardis,'' or `` always late.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> showed reporters the spoils of war but not the war itself, which was, of course, the reason for the pool in the first place. Exposure to ongoing events was almost an accident for the pool, but it happened. For example: _ An alert photographer yelling `` Whoa! got the press bus to stop at a makeshift prisoner-of-war camp. _ Reporters heading to a pre-set downtown site received an extraordinary view of looting and mayhem when their driver got lost _ The press corps could n't help but witness a surprise attack on Southern Command headquarters, the site of the press center _ On a trip to interview <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commanders west of the city, reporters happened upon an extraordinary scene: more than a thousand people cheering wildly as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists surrendered their weapons to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers All around the country, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> GIs and local citizens were more than happy to tell their stories. But, not being witnesses themselves, reporters were forced to piece things together and deal with difficult contradictions. At <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>, a Panamanian army base west of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> rangers fresh from their first real combat told of parachuting into an intense firefight. Several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lives were lost, and one paratrooper was shot in the doorway of his C-130 aircraft as he prepared to jump, they said. His Ranger comrades had to pull him back to save his life. But back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the brass was saying how the attack on <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION> had been cleared of resistance thanks to new Stealth fighter planes which evaded radar for a bombing run which distracted the defenders. At <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was the `` Witch House,'' a modest residence where <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was said to have kept his four Brazilian voodoo witches. Reporters were shown the evidence of strange ritual: a bucket of blood, animal entrails, and a variety of religious artifacts carefully arranged on a desk that apparently served as an altar. But before reporters were allowed in, the military removed what soldiers said were packets of cocaine wrapped in tropical leaves. Soldiers who confiscated the stockpile described their haul as about 50 pounds of cocaine. At headquarters and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the generals said it was 50 kilograms, which, at 2.2 pounds per kilo, would better back up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claim that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved heavily in the drug trade. It was possible the generals were referring to cocaine also recovered elsewhere, but reporters never were able to reconcile the figures.

<TEXT>
 The manslaughter conviction of a Hispanic officer in the deaths of two blacks had raised hopes for healing a decade of racial tension. Instead, the verdict has spread tensions within police ranks. Talk of a work slowdown by the police and an allegation that a Hispanic policeman hesitated before responding to a backup request from a black officer have embroiled the force in recent weeks. The local branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> even asked Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> on Friday to have <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> patrol <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s black neighborhoods. `` If I needed police protection, I would not feel comfortable calling the police because of the attitude of some of the officers,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> McMillian </PERSON>'s request, and Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> and Police Chief <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> assured the community that officers of all races would act professionally. Tensions have been evident since a jury found Colombian-born officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> guilty Dec. 7 in the deaths of black motorcyclist <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> and his passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>. During the past two weeks, an Hispanic <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officer and a white <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> policeman have been suspended for wearing black tape on their badges or black wristbands to protest the verdict. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has raised funds and presented <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> with a `` Brotherhood in Blue'' T-shirt _ a mocking reference to the term prosecutors used during the trial to accuse officers of protecting each other. Many black officers, however, agreed with the verdict and see fund-raising, wristbands and clemency petitions as a slap in the face. `` For the very people who uphold law and order, to take exception in such a blatant manner, is extremely insensitive,'' said Officer <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But to many other officers, <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> is seen as a martyr to the community's desperation to avoid a fifth race riot in the 1980s. Two previous disturbances followed acquittals of officers charged with killing blacks, and the Jan. 16 deaths of <LOCATION> Lloyd </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> ignited three days of riots. `` It would n't have made a difference whether he was Hispanic or black _ he did n't receive a fair trial,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, head of the Hispanic Officer's <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> defended officers' action in support of <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>. He said some black officers cheered and gave each other high-fives when the conviction was announced. `` If the blacks were permitted to celebrate, then we have the right to protest,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. Some community leaders have blamed past racial violence on a feeling by blacks that they are being left behind while the Hispanic population grows in size, wealth and influence. Hispanic gains in the community have been reflected in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police force during the past decade. Today, 44 percent of the force's 1,100 officers are <PERSON> Hispanic </PERSON>, 19 percent are black and 37 percent non-Hispanic white. The changes have created divisions that did n't exist before, when <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> joined blacks in challenging `` Anglos'' for jobs and promotions, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. `` Before, we probably had better working relations with black officers than we did with <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> officers _ but not now,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. In the week following <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s conviction, a Hispanic officer was accused of stalling on the way to the aid of a black officer who had called for assistance. The incident prompted a meeting of the Hispanic and black officers associations with police officials to soothe the tension. `` This used to be a war between the police and the criminal,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Hialeah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, who mediated the meeting. `` We do not need to have a war between police and police.'' The mayor also met with <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and police unions. `` They showed a lot of sensitivity,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said. Nevertheless, police unions continue to fight the suspensions of the two officers punished for the black bands and raise money for <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s appeal. Members of the Fraternal Order of Police each have agreed to donate $ 260 to defray <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s legal expenses. The Hispanic Officers Association is selling its own T-shirts and distributing black wristbands to departments around the state, said <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. Although police chiefs have banned in-uniform displays of support, many Miami-area officers wear black wristbands off-duty. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s defense attorney, said he has n't been surprised by the support. `` A lot of people did n't take it seriously until he was convicted,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. `` I get more calls all the time from people, many of them police officers, who want to know what they can do.''

<HEAD>Employment Rights Bill Tops Civil Rights Shopping List on Capitol

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Civil rights forces, stunned by what they see as a wave of setbacks in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last June, are putting a congressional agenda forward for next year. `` We'll have a fight but we'll win because civil rights is looked upon with favor these days,'' declares Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif. A civil rights bill, set to be unveiled soon after lawmakers return from the holidays, could focus political pressure on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Opposition would risk alienating the black community while support would mean repudiation of court decisions that have found favor among conservatives. The sponsors, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., and bipartisan coalitions in both houses are expected to introduce the bill soon after the 1990 congressional session gets under Thus far, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have been saying they see no problem with recent rulings on the employment discrimination front. They have said they would monitor the results to determine whether legislation is needed. Civil rights forces say it is needed now. While details are not available, proponents say the measure will be designed in large part to counter three decisions by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last June: _ The court held in a June 5 decision involving two salmon canneries that plaintiffs in hiring bias suits have the burden of proving the practices at issue have no legitimate business purpose Prior to the so-called Wards Cove decision _ named for a packing company that figured in the case _ it was the employer who had to prove that there was a legitimate business reason. _ The justices on June 12 cleared the way for challenges to longstanding, court-approved agreements giving minorities and women preference in hiring for government jobs The <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> case, involving <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, firefighters, was viewed as a sharp setback for affirmative action plans. _ The court ruled June 15 that a civil rights law does not bar racial harassment in the workplace The <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> case was brought by a black woman from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> who said she was mistreated on the job because of her race. In each case, the court was divided 5-4. `` What has happened is that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in its mischievousness, in the past year has actually gutted title 7 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,'' said <PERSON> Althea </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. Title 7 is the job bias portion of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Legislation to counter the decisions `` has to pass _ we have no choice but to pass it,'' she said. `` If you ask, ` Is it going to be smooth sailing?,' I think we have to work hard to pass it, but I think it's going to pass.'' Actually, winning approval for the measure might not turn out to be such a formidable task. No longer the embattled underdogs of yesteryear, civil rights forces have been getting most of what they want from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, often by margins as wide as 70 percent in each house. `` We expect very substantial bipartisan majorities in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to support this vital legislation,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group that includes virtually every civil rights organization active in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Both Ms. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neas </PERSON> described the employment rights measure as far and away the top item on the civil rights agenda for the year ahead. But civil rights forces are pressing for a wide array of other items. They are hoping for legislation to counter a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, case that struck a severe blow at set-asides that reserve a portion of government contracts for minority-owned business. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., is planning hearings Legislation to guarantee civil rights for Americans with disabilities already has been passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> following a compromise agreement with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Action in three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committees is expected when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns from its break. Pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is House-passed legislation that would order the government to gather statistics on so-called hate crimes, directed against racial, religious and ethnic minorities. Committees in both houses have approved legislation that would guarantee employee rights to medical leave in cases involving birth, adoption and serious illness. A conference committee currently is attempting to resolve differences between <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of legislation to provide federal aid for child care, either through grants to states or tax credits. Leaders in both houses have said the measure will get high priority. Incorporated into legislation to reestablish the death penalty now pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is an amendment to bar racial discrimination in imposing it. Civil rights forces also are pressing the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to attach anti-discrimination provisions to pending legislation that would allow voter registration through the mail, provide automatic registration for anyone with a driver's license and require government agencies to register voters. Also pending is Senate-passed legislation that would reauthorize through 1994 discretionary programs to aid handicapped students. Civil rights forces plan to press <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> again for legislation that would guarantee Americans affordable housing.

<TEXT>
 Taxpayers receive their annual holiday greetings from Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> starting today, as the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> mails out more than 107 million tax forms and instruction packages. The forms, which have been waiting at post offices across the nation for weeks, should be in most taxpayers' hands before Jan. 1. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> always times the mailing, which costs $ 26 million for postage and printing, to come right after the crush of Christmas mail but soon enough to give taxpayers as much time as possible to complete their returns before the filing deadline, which falls this year on April 16. For taxpayers still reeling from the sweeping changes wrought by the 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Act </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has reassuring words: the new forms look very much like last year's forms. But to the chagrin of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> officials, one of the few changes should not have been made, and it could confuse millions of elderly Americans. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is trying to get the word out to taxpayers eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> that they should ignore the lines on the tax form covering the supplemental <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> premium. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did away with the premium along with the catastrophic health program it was designed to fund. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not vote to repeal the controversial program until late November, long after the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> forms had gone to the printers. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> hopes to keep confusion to a minimum through a publicity campaign to get word to the 12 million elderly taxpayers who could be affected. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> officials note that the form taxpayers would need to compute their Medicare premium tax liability, Form 8808, does not exist. `` We believe that taxpayers will not want to pay taxes that they do n't have to pay,'' said <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said that if taxpayers still include an amount on the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> premium line, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will refund the money. This year's returns are accompanied by a special pitch from new <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who urges taxpayers to consider filing their returns electronically to cut down on the time it takes to process their refund checks. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is providing a special toll-free telephone number, 1-800-424-1040, for people to call for a list of tax preparers in their area who can file returns electronically. In 1988, two-thirds of all taxpayers qualified for a refund, with the average refund totaling $ 875. All of the changes in this year's forms are explained in the accompanying instruction booklets, which also include a list of other <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> publications that offer further help in preparing taxes. To request additional tax forms and the tax information publications, taxpayers can call the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> at 1-800-424-3676. Among the changes featured in this year's forms: _ The personal exemption, the amount you may exempt from taxation for yourself, your spouse and each dependent, increases to $ 2,000 per person, up from $ 1,950 last year _ The standard deduction, claimed by people who do not itemize, rises to $ 3,100 for a single person, up from $ 3,000 last year The exemption for a couple increases to $ 5,200, up from $ 5,000 last year. _ Tax rates remain the same at 15 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent with about four of every five taxpayers paying only the lowest rate While the rates stay the same, the tax brackets have been widened so that more income will be taxed at lower rates in order to compensate for inflation. _ For the first time, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will include two name lines, instead of one, in recognition that more married couples have different last names The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is looking for 111.2 million individual tax returns to be filed this year with 65 percent expected to opt for the comprehensive Form 1040, designed for taxpayers who itemize or who have incomes above $ 50,000 annually. Two shorter forms, Form 1040A and the brief nine-line Form 1040EZ, are available for taxpayers who do not itemize and can meet other qualifications. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> form each taxpayer receives is based on the form that taxpayer used last year.

<HEAD>China Faces Growing Demand for Imported Wheat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is the world's largest wheat producer but is not keeping pace with its own consumer demand for more bread, noodles and dumplings. As a result, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been buying huge amounts of wheat from other countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst says import demand will continue to grow, at least through the turn of the century. `` Even though it is the world's largest producer of wheat, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s domestic demand exceeds supplies,'' says <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crook </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Wheat output has risen steadily as farmers have boosted yields because of greater irrigation and use of improved varieties.'' Crook, in a report on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s wheat economy, said population growth and `` consumer preference for wheat products'' such as noodles, steamed dumplings, bread and pastries have spurred demand. As the world's most populous country with 1.1 billion people, even slight changes in per capita use can translate into large numbers. Crook said per capita wheat consumption rose steadily from 29 kilograms in 1960 to 48 kilos in 1978. Then, as supplies increased because of import and production gains, the average jumped to 90 kilograms per person in 1987. A kilogram is about 2.2 pounds. Ninety kilos would be about 198 pounds, or approximately 3.3 bushels of wheat, allowing 60 pounds per bushel. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been at peaks and valleys as a customer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat farmers since the early 1970s. Lately, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has been a large and consistent buyer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, rivaling the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at times. In the 1988-89 wheat marketing year that ran through last May 31, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> imported almost 8.1 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and became the largest foreign customer of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> growers. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, by comparison, imported 4.96 million tons in the same period. So far in 1989-90, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought about 4.7 million tons against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s purchases as of Dec. 14 of less than 2 million tons. A metric ton, the unit favored in world grain trade, is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. It also is equal to 1,000 kilograms. Both <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have bought large amounts of wheat under a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> price subsidy arrangement, the Export Enhancement Program. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, private exporters can sell to designated foreign countries at reduced prices and then collect USDA-owned commodities as `` bonuses'' or subsidies to make up the price difference. From a production standpoint, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been the world's largest wheat producer in four of the last five years, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> statistics. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s wheat output this year, for example, is estimated at 91 million tons, compared with 89 million for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and 55.6 million for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Other major producers this year include: <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 24.4 million tons; <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, 12.5 million; <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, 10.7 million; <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, 53 million; <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, 42.3 million; and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, 79.3 million. Crook said that by world standards <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has achieved `` fairly high wheat yields'' and is surpassing those in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and countries which have large areas of non-irrigated wheat, such as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On the other hand, Crook said wheat yields are higher in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Crook said that Chinese experts predict wheat yields will climb an average of about 1.65 percent a year and that by the year 2000 there will be some decrease in total wheat area. But they claim that total output by then will increase to between 100 million and 105 million tons. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s population will continue to grow in the next decade, and if per capita income continues to rise, demand for wheat will also increase,'' Crook said. `` However, prospects for rapid gains in domestic wheat output are dim because little arable -LRB- land -RRB- can be shifted to wheat production, and yields are already high.'' As a result, he added, the outlook for wheat exports to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` looks promising in the near future.'' But the rate of growth will depend mostly on the ability of the rest of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy to earn foreign exchange.

 A retired policeman who was facing major heart surgery fatally shot his ailing wife because he was afraid he could n't take care of her and did n't want her to suffer anymore, authorities say. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 67, was charged with first-degree murder in the death of his wife, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, who suffered from multiple sclerosis, said Police Sgt. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was released on personal recognizance into his daughter's custody after a Christmas Day hearing. The prosecutor agreed with a defense lawyer that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who retired six years ago, posed no threat to society. `` Good luck and Merry Christmas,'' Circuit Court Judge <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Garber </PERSON> told <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> at the close of the hearing. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was scheduled to appear for another hearing today. Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 64, apparently died instantly Christmas Eve when her husband of 44 years shot her in the head with a .38 - caliber revolver as she sat in her wheelchair, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> then called police and handed over the gun when officers arrived at the home, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. `` It's a sad thing to happen on any day, and it just seems to be embellished by the fact that it's Christmas Eve,'' said <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the officers that `` all his wife did was complain about how much she was suffering and she begged him to end it,'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' doctor recently told him he needed a second major heart operation and he would n't be able to care for his wife, according to an account given to police by <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' daughter. Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> suffered from multiple sclerosis, a degenerative disease of the nervous system, for 20 years, and had heart and kidney problems, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. `` His health was n't the best and hers was deteriorating,'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure the guy is overwrought.''

<HEAD>Cuba Believed Sending Weapons to Leftists by Remote Mexican Route</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is believed to be using a remote Mexican land route to send weapons to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is believed to have started using the alternate route some time ago, and indications are that use of the route _ beginning in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> _ has increased recently, said the officials, who asked not to be identified. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has traditionally used <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as its primary transit point for weapons deliveries to its allies in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. It was not clear whether <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials have been approached by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats about the alleged shipments. There was no immediate comment from the Mexican government. Historically, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has been sympathetic to the Salvadoran rebels but that support has been more muted since President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> took office a year ago. Much of the weaponry sent to the Salvadoran insurgents is supplied by the Soviet bloc and delivered via <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, according to officials. Recent administration statements indicate that it sees <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> _ not the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> bloc </LOCATION> _ as the principal villain in these activities. As described by officials, the Cubans ship the weapons across the narrow channel that separates <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. From there, the equipment is sent by truck to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> although the precise route is not clear. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government has been criticized internationally for its alleged collaboration with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in supporting the Salvadoran rebels. As <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials see it, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s apparent search for new ways to help the Salvadoran rebels _ without relying exclusively on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ may be an effort to limit the chances that the Sandinista role will be exposed more than it has been. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has denied that its territory has been used for subversive activities in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Such interference is a violation of Central American agreements signed by Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. The Sandinista government has been in the forefront of the international effort over the past week to have the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration condemned for its invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s response also has been indignant The administration views <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s purported use of the route through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> as a supplement to the support the Nicaraguans are providing as a transit point for Cuban-supplied weapons. As evidence that the Sandinista connection has not been abandoned, the administration has cited the discovery of weapons by <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> officials aboard a truck said to have been headed to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The driver of the truck involved in the Oct. 18 weapons seizure told authorities he had been making the run between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> monthly since August 1988. According to officials, a more revealing incident occurred on Nov. 25 when a plane carrying surface-to-air missiles crashed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The plane had taken off from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and its destination reportedly was rebel-held territory in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The officials contend <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> are intent on providing assistance to the Salvadoran rebels during the current period because it may be more difficult in the coming months. One reason: peacekeepers from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> are being assigned to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to ensure that provisions of regional agreements are being kept. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been pressing <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials to ensure that the peacekeepers, among other duties, are on the lookout for deliveries to the Salvadoran rebels from outside the county's borders.

<TEXT>
 The key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed at yet another record high Tuesday, while the dollar edged down against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 257.69 points, or 0.67 percent, ending at 38,681.31. The index had gained 383.25 points Monday as investors welcomed the third discount rate increase by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> this year. The previous record was 38,586.18 on Dec. 18. The dollar closed at 142.37 yen, down 0.35 yen from its finish of 142.72 yen on Monday, when it fell 0.95 yen. It opened Tuesday at 142.94 yen and ranged between 142.30 yen and 142.95 yen. `` Share prices were higher almost all across the board,'' said <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurokawa </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Although stock investors are normally discouraged by a discount rate hike, they boosted buy orders following the Monday announcement by the central bank, mainly because investors were reassured that there would be no more major changes in monetary policy for a while, <PERSON> Kurokawa </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> raised the discount rate to 4.25 percent from its current level at 3.75 percent. The discount rate is the rate the central bank charges on its loans to commercial banks. `` A majority of market players think all the negative factors in the market have disappeared,'' <PERSON> Kurokawa </PERSON> said. In currency dealings, the market was quiet becuase many overseas markets, including those in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, were closed for Christmas holidays, traders said. After the dollar hit a high at 142.95 yen, investors began to sell the currency for profit-taking and small position adjustments, they said. <PERSON> Toru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON>, a foreign exchange analyst with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the dollar-yen rate remained inactive because the market had already responded to the discount rate hike Monday. `` The market had been well prepared for the hike since the rumor had come out last Tuesday,'' <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON> said. `` Everybody knew there would be a 0.5 percentage point hike, so the hike yesterday had little impact.'' Also, traders said that a mere 0.5 percentage-point raise would not boost yen-buying because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s discount rate is still substantially lower than those of other industrialized nations. Market players were reluctant to buy the dollar as well, due to uncertainties over whether the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will cut its discount rate, <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says it arrested five <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> residents on charges of trying to smuggle dissidents out of the country and today accused a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> group of running an `` underground railroad.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alliance </LOCATION> for Supporting the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> helped dozens of dissidents flee abroad since the army crackdown on pro-democracy protests in June. Police said the arrests `` dealt a major blow to the overseas reactionary forces who attempted to use <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> as sanctuaries for criminals,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in a report Monday. The five arrests were made over the past three months, and <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> did not say why they were being announced only now. It said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will `` punish severely those who dare to plot and ship wanted criminals out of the mainland.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said repeatedly it will not allow residents of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> to interfere in mainland affairs, but this was the first time it explicitly accused the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> alliance of running the underground railroad. The alliance was founded after the June crackdown, which increased anxiety in British-ruled <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and Portuguese-ruled <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> about their return to <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> rule in the coming decade. The official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> defended the arrests in an editorial in today's editions, saying `` <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> residents must obey Chinese laws when on the mainland.'' In excerpts of the editorial, the paper accused the alliance of smuggling abroad `` important counter-revolutionary criminals. ... The Chinese government will never tolerate such activities.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> considers ethnic Chinese from the two colonies to be <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> citizens and has rejected past efforts by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to intervene on behalf of arrested <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Chinese. The arrests were likely to increase <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> fears about Chinese rule, which already have sent many in search of haven elsewhere.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor is trying to encourage serious research on extraterrestrials by reviving a professional journal. The Journal of UFO Studies, resurrected this year from a defunct publication of the same name, aims to give researchers something `` they would n't be embarrassed by writing for,'' said its editor, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Swords </PERSON>. `` It's meant to allow the serious people to have an outlet, which does n't really exist right now. This was a hole in UFO publishing that had to be filled,'' the professor of natural sciences said recently. Swords, who is working on the second annual issue, said the $ 15 journal, with a circulation of about 700, is too technical for the general public. For example, one of the first issue's three articles of about 35 pages each discussed chemical analyses of a substance gleaned from the Delphos Case, a supposed 1971 UFO landing site in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. Another looked at the effect of hypnosis in obtaining information from people who claim they have been abducted by aliens. Swords wrote a third article, about whether other life exists in the universe. He said it is n't a matter of if, but of how many. `` All the laws of nature are the same everywhere, and what happens once is bound to happen twice. Chances of other high-tech extraterrestrial civilizations are equal to how long it could exist after reaching the danger zone of technology. `` Since we're made it 45 years past nuclear weapons, I think people think there are at least dozens if not thousands of high-tech civilizations out there,'' Swords said.

 Owners of a high-rise retirement home where a Christmas Eve fire killed 16 people had planned to install a sprinkler system in the spring, the manager says. `` We did n't feel uncomfortable with the safety of the building. We just had seen fires, basically on TV and other places. The comment was made that the sprinkler system would have been a benefit,'' <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trivett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M Properties, which manages the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sevier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday night. <PERSON> Trivett </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sevier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the 11-story building, was going to have sprinklers put in at a cost of $ 100,000. The 5-decade-old building did have water hoses on each floor and met the fire code in effect in 1977, when it was converted from a hotel into apartments for retirees, according to Lt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, fire marshal for this eastern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> city of 40,000. He said the current fire code requires sprinklers for buildings undergoing renovations. `` We inherit these buildings,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. `` They're no more dangerous, it just means they do n't meet the present codes ... Legally they do n't have to.'' The fire broke out Sunday evening on the first or second floor of the building, where about 145 people lived, and sent thick smoke billowing through the upper floors. Officials said the deaths occurred on the upper floors, probably because of smoke inhalation. About 50 people were injured, including about 15 firefighters. The cause of the fire was under investigation, but <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said it appeared accidental. In October, a resident of the home died when a kerosene heater, apparently mistakenly filled with gasoline, ignited his apartment. After that fire, Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Souder </PERSON> said, he stepped up pressure on the owners to install sprinklers. `` I feel like if a building is sprinkled and if the sprinkler is working properly then we would n't have had life loss,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>. Sunday's disaster might have been worse had so many residents not been away for Christmas, said Mayor P.C. <PERSON> Snapp </PERSON>. `` I ca n't think of a worse time, on Christmas Eve,'' <PERSON> Snapp </PERSON> said. `` On the other hand, it could have been a good time because a number of people had gone to visit relatives.'' Fourteen victims lived in the building and the two others were visiting residents. Residents of upper floors waved flashlights and screamed for help from the windows of their smoke-filled apartments. `` We could hear some people over there screaming, ` We ca n't hold out much longer!' then all at once we did n't hear them anymore,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Hambric </PERSON>, whose 77-year-old mother was rescued from her ninth-floor apartment. Up to 250 firefighters fought the blaze, which took about nearly seven hours to control. Some of them suffered frostbite. Most of the injured were treated for smoke inhalation and released. At least one person was seriously burned, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Northside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Ten of 11 residents who had been listed as missing Monday have been accounted for. The 11th person is believed to have been away at the time. The fire marshal said he did n't know if owners plan to renovate the building or tear it down. He said it appeared to be structurally sound. <PERSON> Trivett </PERSON>, the building manager, said, `` If it's renovated, it will be renovated to today's codes.''

After he opened the box and discovered the color, Slate returned to the store. But a guard blocked his entrance, saying the store was closing. As Slate persisted, the guard warned him he could be arrested. With that, police reports say, Slate extended his arms and told the guard to lock him up. The guard did. Authorities said Slate faces misdemeanor charges of criminal trespass and disorderly conduct. He was being held on $ 1,000 bond.

 Facing an uncertain future, thousands of people left homeless by the firepower of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops who ousted Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> lined up at a refugee camp for a Christmas dinner of GI rations. President <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his vice presidents, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, visited the camp Monday for a Mass celebrated by Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> five days after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion. Residents swarmed around them, shouting `` Viva Endara!'' and `` Long live the civilian government!'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> won May elections that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> annulled. Christmas dinners were served in makeshift plastic shelters and large <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> tents. `` We served more than 8,000 meals last night,'' Army Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said Monday. `` The lines were longer than we or they would have liked.'' Many of the refugees, their arms and legs in casts or bandages, quietly wondered what would happen to them now. They lost their homes in fighting between <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces that attacked Wednesday to oust the military ruler. `` Well, you know, it's a place to stay meanwhile,'' said <PERSON> Pilab </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, 40, a store clerk. `` It is safe here and there is food. Of course I am sad to have my home gone at Christmas, but I have my life and they say we will leave here in a few weeks.'' The camp is at <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> and High School, just south of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the former Canal Zone near the canal administration building. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has erected 14 large tents and hopes to put up 14 more. Many of the homeless have patched together shelter from what was available. `` There are between 9,000 and 10,000 people here but you do n't see that many now,'' said <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> native `` A lot of them leave during the day to where their homes were and search for any belongings they can bring back here,'' he said. `` They come back in the evenings. We can estimate the population by the number of meals we serve.'' For many, the clothes they have on are all they managed to save. The camp is clean and orderly, and <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said it has extensive medical facilities. Both the troops and the homeless consider it fortunate that now is the start of the dry season in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, with no torrential rains expected. Organization of the camp has been turned over to <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvez </PERSON>, mayor of the <LOCATION> Chorrillo </LOCATION> district that surrounded <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters The district was devastated in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack, and most of the camp residents came from there. `` I have been talking with presidential advisers and they are very willing to help rebuild,'' <PERSON> Galvez </PERSON> said. `` We all want to go back to <LOCATION> Chorrillo </LOCATION>. We hope the government of President <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> will solve this problem very quickly.'' Army Col. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> are looking into an urban reconstruction program for Chorrillo. <PERSON> Galvez </PERSON> divided the camp into six sectors, based on people's neighborhoods before their homes were destroyed in the fighting The homeless form orderly lines for <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> rations. A few cooked rice or other staples over small fires. One family opened a small store with a few cans of food.

 When a fire early one morning claimed the lives of their three young boys, Dubby and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> made a bittersweet choice. They donated their boys' organs for transplant operations. Two days later, the heart of 10-year-old <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> was beating in the body of a 48-year-old woman in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>' first heart transplant. The livers of <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> and his 9-year-old brother, <PERSON> Jake </PERSON>, were transplanted into the bodies of a 14-year-old <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> boy and a 33-year-old <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> woman. And the boys' kidneys went to four <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> residents. Those who know the <ORGANIZATION> Wilcoxes </ORGANIZATION> said their decision was typical of their unselfishness. As word of the tragedy spread, friends, neighbors and even strangers responded to give to them. In a few hours, a radio station's plea for help generated thousands of dollars. A restaurant planned a benefit dinner, church groups provided food, children collected pennies and employees of a grocery chain authorized payroll deductions. Others in Bald Knob, a town of 2,700 residents about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, contributed clothing, furniture, appliances, vehicles, utilities and even a house, provided rent-free for the next year and renovated in a day's time by dozens of volunteers. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> smiled, then cried as she recalled entering the home for the first time. `` You could n't move,'' she said. `` There were people lined up all along the walls. And they all hollered, ` Welcome home.''' The three <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> children were sleeping in their beds the morning of Nov. 8 while Mrs. <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> drove her husband to work just a few blocks away. In those few minutes, the house was engulfed in smoke, the result of what Police Chief <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said was a short circuit. Five-year-old <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> died of smoke inhalation that morning. <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> died the following day, also of smoke inhalation. When first approached about donating their sons' organs, the <ORGANIZATION> Wilcoxes </ORGANIZATION> said no. Minutes later, after considering what they thought the boys would have wanted, they changed their minds. Mrs. <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said the knowledge that her children saved lives is comforting. `` There's people that've got loved ones because of my boys,'' she said. The transplant of <PERSON> Jared </PERSON>'s heart to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> allowed her to celebrate Christmas with her family. She said Monday she hoped to meet <PERSON> Jared </PERSON>'s parents. `` I feel that it was a gift from that family, a gift of life from that family,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` I'm really anxious to get to know them. I just feel like I'm part of their family now.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Wilcoxes </ORGANIZATION>' generosity also has helped others who need an organ transplant, said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Cumberland </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. `` We had more organ donor referrals in November than in any month in our history, and I think a large part of that is due to this family's decision to tell their story,'' he said. Their story has touched people around the country. The couple received about 3,000 letters. Donations have swelled to more than $ 20,000. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Risener </PERSON> of radio station <ORGANIZATION> KWCK </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <PERSON> Searcy </PERSON> called the response to the station's on-air request for donations unbelievable. `` Within a few minutes, we had $ 500,'' he said. `` Within three hours, we had $ 6,000, and it just continued to climb.'' A teary-eyed elderly woman walked in the station's door with a $ 100 donation. Students from nearby <ORGANIZATION> Harding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> carried in jugs of nickels, dimes and quarters. One man who does n't drive arranged a ride 15 miles into town to donate $ 1. After the boys died, friends of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilcoxes </ORGANIZATION> feared the couple might leave Bald Knob, particularly since they had no home. `` I did n't want them leaving,'' <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said. `` I felt that if they left, it would have been a big loss in the community. Our youth program would n't be the same without Dubby.'' <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said a small group of friends decided to take on renovation of the house offered by real estate agents <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Verla </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. More than 50 people showed up to help. The house was little more than a shell. But in nine hours, volunteers installed electrical wiring, plumbing, a septic tank, the water line, a heating unit, appliances and bathroom fixtures. Utilities were turned on, and <ORGANIZATION> Simms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Searcy </PERSON> filled up the fuel tank, leaving behind a ticket that said `` No charge.'' The workers cleaned, painted, hung curtains and stocked the pantry and medicine chest. And to make the house a home, volunteers decorated the walls with items from their own walls. `` This is the closest to home right now we can get,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said. `` You do n't realize how many friends you have'til something like this happens,'' <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> added.

 The century-old Tournament of Roses Parade takes to the streets New Year's Day with millions of flowers, amazing floats and some of the world's most distinguished marching bands. Then there's a group of <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> musicians who just months ago could n't play trumpets and trombones. The 140-member <ORGANIZATION> Sampoerna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indonesia </ORGANIZATION> will be its country's first representatives in Monday's parade, tournament officials said The band has been practicing furiously. Even their director, <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, did n't know at first if they'd be ready. Now, he said, they are. `` They really have worked extremely hard,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said during a recent telephone interview from <LOCATION> Surabaya </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> city of 4 million people in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Java </LOCATION> where the band is based. `` Marching band instruments are not their native instruments, so when we started they did n't even know what a trumpet was supposed to sound like,'' he said. He has drilled the musicians, two-thirds of whom are women, for 40 hours a week for 11 months. The band also has marched and marched and marched, three to four miles a day in the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> heat. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, who moved from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> early this year to work with the band, said the ensemble submitted an audition tape to tournament officials because `` we wanted to shoot for the top.'' `` Even over here the Rose Parade is known as the world's premiere parade. When they learned of their acceptance, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said they were thrilled. `` I wish you could have seen their faces,'' he said. The Indonesians, who range from age 16 to 42, will join elite company. They will be among the 22 bands, 60 floats and 29 equestrian units that an estimated 1 million people are expected to turn out to see. Millions more will watch on television. The band will march amid such high-technology floats as the General Motors-United Auto Workers entry, which is a 33-foot-long land vehicle of the future that converts into a 60-foot-tall robot in seconds, and the city of <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>'s entry _ a 55-foot-long `` Be-Bop Malt Shop'' that pays tribute to'50s rock music and nostalgia with a giant juke box and roller-skating waitresses. Other parade veterans are the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units, as well as aggregations from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> bands will be high-stepping in the parade hours before the two schools' football teams play in the annual Rose Bowl game. If they had n't passed the audition, they would have tried again next year, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. But the group was ready, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Riffey </PERSON>, chairman of the Tournament of Roses music committee. `` They looked very good,'' he said. `` They're a very good band.'' For the band members, the parade promises to be only one highlight of the trip. Most get around <LOCATION> Surabaya </LOCATION> by bicycle or scooter and live very modestly, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. Only one band member has been outside the country before, and <PERSON> Riffey </PERSON> said one person expressed concern about where band members would bathe in an area with so few rivers as <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. She was told about indoor showers, he said. The group's members are looking forward to sampling their first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hamburgers, visiting <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and going skiing, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. That latter experience might provide the greatest culture shock of all, he said. `` These guys put on coats when the temperature falls to 80,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> is on the equator and the temperature is usually 90 to 100.'' But whatever the weather, the band is ready to play its repertoire of <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> marching tuns and folk, pop and patriotic songs, all of which work surprisingly well as marching music, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` They're very proud to be representing their country,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> is a young country and patriotism is not considered corny.''

<TEXT>
 With thousands of its bridges in need of repairs, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is turning to a building material that's strong and durable, relatively cheap, easy to work with and pleasant to look at It's wood. Far from being a way to cut corners, engineers say wood is in many respects better than the traditional steel and concrete in the kind of short, lightly traveled, rural bridges most in need of repair. `` Using wood is really our best shot at building the longest-lasting bridge with minimal maintenance,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, a road engineer for <LOCATION> Cattaraugus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, in western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Nearly a fifth of the 270 bridges maintained by the county have some wood. The issue is significant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, because the state is faced with billions of dollars in repair costs for 7,650 state - and locally-owned spans that are n't up to standards The deficiencies were discovered after a bridge on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thruway </ORGANIZATION> collapsed in April 1987 in an accident that claimed 10 lives. If properly pressure-treated and preserved, wood is virtually impervious to the enemy that rots out conventional steel-and-concrete bridges _ road salt _ said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a professor of wood products engineering at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. `` There's no reason wood should n't last 50 or 100 years or more from a strength and durability standpoint,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Steel and concrete bridges, on the other hand, can show serious deterioration after just 10 or 12 years on roads that are heavily salted in the winter, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. Proponents of wood point to covered bridges, some of which more than a century old, as evidence of the longevity of wooden spans. Some elm pilings examined when the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> was dismantled and shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a tourist attraction had been in service for 400 years. The cost savings achieved by using wood can vary considerably, according to the length of the span, design, location, and other factors, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, a structural engineer with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. Costs can drop 20 percent or more when wood is used instead of concrete and steel for a bridge's superstructure, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON>, an engineer for <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said many road workers prefer working with wood to concrete. `` Workers tend to have more of a familiarity with wood, they feel more comfortable with it,'' <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON> said. `` Instead of hiring expert welders and elaborate equipment you do n't have in normal inventory, with the wood you have workers drilling holes, attaching bolts and using tools and equipment they're used to.'' Despite the potential cost savings, timber is seldom used in bridges around the country, said <PERSON> Clellon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovall </PERSON>, chief engineer in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s transportation department and chairman of the subcommittee on bridges and structures for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Officials. Wood has probably become attractive to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> highway officials, he said, because it sometimes costs two or three times more to build a bridge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> than in other states due to high labor, contracting and material expenses. `` It is limited in strength and connection capabilities,'' said T.Y. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, founder and honorary board chairman of the T.Y. Lin International engineering firm in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` However, there are certainly places where it can be profitably or economically used.'' Generally, timber bridge experts say wood should be used only in spans shorter than 50 feet. There are other potential drawbacks: beams can split, especially under high pressure, and once that happens they must be replaced. Wood can shrink and swell in varying moisture and temperature conditions, possibly causing weaknesses in footings. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, wood is most often used in construction of the superstructure _ that portion of the bridge placed atop pilings to support the deck _ or to build the deck itself. In steel-and-concrete spans, both parts are highly susceptible to corrosion due to road salt and rust.

 Americans took time out from family celebrations to bring Christmas cheer to the unfortunate, sorting cards for GIs in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, staffing soup kitchens and even giving up their own feasts when thieves took food destined for the needy.

Wounded soldiers at <ORGANIZATION> Wilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> exchanged presents with relatives in special visiting rooms, said Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Adame </PERSON>, a hospital spokesman. Residents volunteered to help sort gifts, cards and letters sent to the GIs injured in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. For many Americans, it was a day for church services or quiet personal celebration of the birth of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. But many extended gift-giving beyond their families, sharing with the less fortunate. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, some homeless people dined on pizza instead of turkey and ham after thieves stole 400 turkeys and thousands of dollars worth of food and toys collected for a Christmas meal. Then, when word got out of the theft, Atlantans nearly overwhelmed the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> with traditional holiday fare, much of it apparently destined for their own tables, said attorney <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Boortz </PERSON>, one of the organizers. `` We told the people that we needed some more turkey, some more ham, and people at home today are taking the <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> and the ham they were going to eat and were putting it in boxes and bags and bringing it to us,'' <PERSON> Boortz </PERSON> said. `` They were looking in their cabinets for some canned goods and were making themselves some spaghetti or something.'' Organizers estimated that 20,000 people showed up. `` This is the helping spirit of <LOCATION> Kwanzaa </LOCATION>, Christmas and Hanukkah all wrapped into one,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a volunteer on the food line. Kwanzaa is an African-American celebration. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Center </PERSON>, also hit by theft of thousands of dollars worth of food intended for Christmas Eve dinner for 1,500 needy people, was back in business Christmas Day, bolstered by donations from city residents.

 <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new president, is a former senior Communist official who was demoted for standing up to <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and is said to be a close friend of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had stripped <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> of the prestigious post of party secretary and had him assigned to direct a publishing house. <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, 59, announced on television Friday the formation of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which he described as the `` new organ of state power'' in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. On Saturday, he announced <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s arrest Today, <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> was appointed president by the provisional government. He holds a university degree in business administration and also studied hydrology at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where knowledgeable Romanians say he got to know <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. While originally one of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s close aides in the late 1960s as the man responsible for youth problems and propaganda, he was demoted from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 and later from the Cabinet. He became regional party secretary in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Roamania </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Iasi </LOCATION>, near the Soviet border, in the early 1970s and was summoned to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> and named chairman of a council for water administration. Fired from that job after a sharp exchange with <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and the dictator's wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, at a party meeting in the mid-1980s, <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> was named director of the <PERSON> Editura </PERSON> <PERSON> Tehnica </PERSON> publishing house. His reported friendly ties with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> saved him from a more dramatic fall, informed sources said. `` <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, as a local party chief, was very informal. He never used the word ` comrade' when addressing people and was ready to talk to them as soon as they knocked at his door,'' said <PERSON> Cornelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimitriu </PERSON>, a university professor in <LOCATION> Iasi </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> was sent in 1974 to serve as regional party secretary. `` He could n't stand <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s personality cult and he did not refrain like others from expressing it,'' she said in an interview. `` He often did not obey the orders he received from <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>.'' `` <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> fell out of favor with <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> because he was outspoken and frequently aired his grievances. He is a technocrat and not an ideologist,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dimitriu </PERSON> said. Born in 1930 into a worker's family in eastern <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, who is married but has no children, held a number of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> jobs throughout the 1960s, enabling him to work his way up through the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. At one point he headed the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propaganda </ORGANIZATION>, and from 1967 to 1971 he was Minister of Youth Problems. <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, long rumored to be a possible successor to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, did not sign a March 1989 letter to the former Romanian leader that protested the dictator's human rights violations and his despotic rule. Informed Romanians said it might have jeopardized <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> had he openly joined them, preferring to appear unblemished in the eyes of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, whose secret police reportedly kept close tabs on his private life. `` He obviously managed to outfox them,'' <PERSON> Mircea </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoica </PERSON>, a former professor at <ORGANIZATION> Bucharest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> stated Friday that the new government would establish `` a new structure of political power.'' `` The old structure of party and government was liquidated,'' <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> said, possibly indicating the demise of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> `` We will establish a provisional structure which will prepare free elections -LRB- in April -RRB- in which the people will be the decisive factor for pur public life, <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> said.

 Gaming pioneer <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Binion </PERSON>, who started out running illegal craps games and parlayed his fortunes to become owner of one of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s big-time casinos, has died. He was 85. <PERSON> Binion </PERSON> died Monday at <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> of a heart-related condition, according to a statement by <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON> Public Relations of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He had a history of heart problems and entered the hospital several days ago for observation. `` I'd asked the doctors in gamblers' terms what were his odds, and they told me six or eight to one against him,'' said his son, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Binion </PERSON>. `` This morning I could see he was n't going to make it.'' He said his father, who owned the <LOCATION> Horsehoe </LOCATION> casino, had been given the last rites of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Binion </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Grayson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to a family that sold race horses on the county fair circuit, a connection that provided his entry into the gambling world. He started out running illegal craps games, usually out of hotel rooms. `` The craps table would have legs that folded down and it fit into a crate that looked like a bed crate, and since hotels always had beds going in or out, if you had 30 minutes notice that you were going to be raided, you could clean the place out,'' he once recalled. He was said to have killed two people in gunfights during those days, but never went to prison for them, with the charges dropped in each case. He never apologized for them either, once saying, `` Tough times make tough people.'' He did serve time in prison for selling liquor during Prohibition and for income tax evasion in the 1950s. But toward the end of his life he had become such a friend of law enforcement that police officers borrowed money from his casino to make major undercover drug buys. <PERSON> Binion </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> in 1946 and bought the Horseshoe five years later, quickly building it into one of the city's premiere attractions. `` I was around it and just drifted into it,'' he once said. Among the gaming memorabilia featured at the club are $ 1 million worth of $ 10,000 bills. The club, also known for its million-dollar craps table bets and its annual $ 10,000 buy-in World Series of Poker tournament, now occupies a city block. In addition to his wife, <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, and son, surviors include two daughters, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beckey </PERSON> <PERSON> Behnen </PERSON>, another son, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>. Funeral arrangements were pending.

 Advanced-technology `` stealth'' jets slipped through Panamanian air defenses and dropped two 2,000-pound bombs on a military base in the early hours of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion, said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told a Monday news conference in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that the raid before dawn Wednesday was intended to `` stun and disorient'' the Panamanian Defense Forces at <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION> before airborne troops were dropped there. The troops attacked an officers' school and base of the <ORGANIZATION> Machos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> battalion, one of deposed Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s crack units The raid, first reported by a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman on Saturday, was the first combat use of the F-117A fighter jet that employs `` stealth'' technology designed to elude radar. To date, the super-secret fighter built by the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been kept from public viewing, with a squadron based in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. A photograph of the plane released by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> last year depicts a relatively small swept-wing plane with a flat underbelly. From some angles it looks like a stingray. Stealth technology makes extensive use of exotic composite materials, some of which absorb rather than reflect radar waves, and avoids sharp surface angles. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> refused to elaborate on negotiations over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sought refuge Sunday in the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy that we would like to see <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> brought for trial,'' he said, adding that the military's role in the hunt for the general had ended and `` now it is up to diplomats and lawyers.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said he met with President <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and vice presidents <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and was `` tremendously impressed with their determination to get the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> back on its feet.'' He would not say what they talked about. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops had discovered a larger supply of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> weapons in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> than they did during the American invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> six years ago. `` It is sure far more weaponry was found than Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could conceivably use even if he armed his forces several times over,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. `` I'm not sure what the purpose of this is.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said additional troops sent for the invasion `` will stay as long as they are needed. ... We do n't want to leave too soon before the objective has been achieved.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> noted that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not turn over the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> for 10 more years and said, `` There were troops here before so there will continue to be a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence for the near future. The defense secretary visited troops earlier Monday and called the invasion `` the most surgical operation of its size ever carried out, not only by our forces but by anybody else's forces.''

 Soldiers wounded in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, wearing Purple Hearts on their pajamas, enjoyed Christmas visits with relatives and celebrated the news that Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> turned himself in. `` I feel glad that the beast is in chains,'' Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlo </PERSON> said Monday during a visit to <ORGANIZATION> Wilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P.W </PERSON>. Stone. <PERSON> Merlo </PERSON>, who is in the military police, said he wished the man who had run <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had turned up somewhere other than in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION>, where he requested asylum Sunday. `` I'm not sure that it was the best place for him to turn himself in for us to get gratification and achieve our ends,'' said <PERSON> Merlo </PERSON>, who suffered at least four gunshot wounds to the abdomen and a nick on the temple. Stone visited wards stacked with Christmas presents and full of visiting relatives at <ORGANIZATION> Wilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Brook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where more than 80 servicemen were being treated. `` We have been vigilant in our defense of our values and the threat to the national interest. But vigilance has its price,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said after the visit. `` We honor the soldiers for their patriotism, bravery and courage.'' As he made his way around hospital rooms, giving <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> medallions as gifts, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> heard firsthand about the fighting. <PERSON> Merlo </PERSON>, 40, with his wife, daughters and other relatives at his side, said he and MP Spec. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuschleg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, were ambushed in the darkness during the first day of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack. Cuschleg, in the next bed, had a finger amputated because of an injury. Pfc. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyne </PERSON>, 21, of <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, also at <ORGANIZATION> Wilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, said he hoped <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s surrender would allow American troops to come home soon. `` I'm glad he did it this early,'' said <PERSON> Heyne </PERSON>, who was wounded by mortar fire. A small jar containing some shrapnel doctors removed from his waist sat next to his bed, and <PERSON> Heyne </PERSON> said he planned to keep it as a souvenir. First Sgt. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Western </PERSON>, 31, recovering at <LOCATION> Brooke </LOCATION>, also expressed delight that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s whereabouts were finally known. `` I'm glad <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> surrendered. It does n't matter where he is, as long as he surrendered,'' said Western, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. So far 250 soldiers, including 15 on Monday, have been brought to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> after being wounded in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

On Christmas morning, soldiers read newspapers reporting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s surrender and displayed Purple Hearts from their pillows or pajamas.

 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> avoided a quick decision on what to do with Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but said fighting in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would likely end now that the ousted strongman has taken refuge in its embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s first official statement since <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sought refuge in the embassy on Sunday, spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said Monday that the `` concerned parties'' would examine <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s case. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said one of the parties was the government of <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, installed after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces invaded. He declined to elaborate on the others. He said it was premature to say whether <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be turned over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he is wanted on drug charges, or given passage to another country, although reports from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> mentioned the possibility of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> going to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> was quoted as saying Monday that asylum for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was the exclusive problem of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the new Panamanian government. In comments to <ORGANIZATION> EFE </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s national news agency, <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> was quoted as saying, `` <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is not the ideal country to accept <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> because of its extradition agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which includes drug trafficking -LRB- cases -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> was asked by Italian state TV, if a `` simple'' turnover of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was foreseeable. `` Well, I do n't think so,'' said <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>. `` There is n't an extradition treaty or anything.'' Earlier, another <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official said he doubted the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> would hand <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over directly to the government of an invading army and suggested the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> could hand him over to the new Panamanian government on condition of a fair trial. The Vatican depicted the situation as an opportunity to bring peace to the Central American country and indicated it knew of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s position before he showed up Sunday afternoon. `` I can announce with satisfaction that the conflict in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> seems to be nearing a solution without further shedding of blood,'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said in a four-paragraph statement. `` And this is good news for Christmas Day.'' `` Concerning the situation of Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in particular, I can confirm that at this moment he is in the Apostolic Nunciature in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, after having expressed the will to end the conflict.'' Asked about any negotiations or discussions preceeding <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s arrival at the embassy, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> declined to respond There have been previous cases of people seeking refuge at <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> embassies, including <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. The embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> sheltered him for a month after he was beaten by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s soldiers. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> was informed of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> case Sunday evening before going to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basilica </LOCATION> to say Christmas midnight Mass. The pope made no direct mention of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in his Christmas address.

<HEAD>No Sorrow for Ceausescu as Romanian Immigrants Pray</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Romanian-Americans prayed for the thousands killed in the uprising in their homeland, but few had sympathy for executed President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, blamed for `` the worst nightmares in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since World War II.'' `` I did n't want him to die ... it's too easy,'' said <PERSON> Lidia </PERSON> <PERSON> Oprean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I wanted him to suffer for a lot of years and understand the Romanian people suffered.'' Ms. <PERSON> Oprean </PERSON> was one of about 200 who gathered on the steps of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Hall Monday to call for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. That was one of many gatherings around the country in response to the execution Monday of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, 71, and his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>. Their executions were ordered after a secret military trial found them guilty of the deaths of more than 60,000 Romanians and the theft of more than $ 1 billion from the country, the new provisional government announced. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's last hard-line communist ruler was ousted by a popular revolt Friday. The uprising was triggered by the massacre of thousands of people protesting <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s harsh rule, and at least several hundred more are believed to have died in fighting since Friday. In a service at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Apostle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Dimitrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> said his country's glimpse of freedom was won at a high cost in bloodshed. `` This is agonizing. This is a terrible tragedy,'' <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> said. `` In the last 40 years, there has n't been a peaceful Christmas, a Christmas where Christians in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> were free to worship until this year.'' About 100 people attended a memorial service outside the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for those killed in the uprising. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, who left <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> five years ago to join his mother who defected earlier, said <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> `` got what he deserved.'' `` He's one of the worst nightmares in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since World War II,'' <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said. The group lit 48 candles at the bottom of a wooden cross on which hung a lantern and a sign saying, `` In memory of the Romanian heroes who have died for freedom of religion, liberty and justice.'' <PERSON> Isai </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotaran </PERSON>, 25, who left <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in 1987, joined about 20 other emigres in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, to set up a fund-raising network to channel aid back to their impoverished homeland. `` I am not pleased with the death,'' <PERSON> Hotaran </PERSON> said. `` Killing him is not enough punishment. Letting him and his family live in prison would have been more just. I do n't think that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had any idea what he had done to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, Dr. <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alin </PERSON> <PERSON> Botoman </PERSON>, who fled <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> as a teen-ager, described the despair he encountered on an August vist to his hometown of Fagaras in southern <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>. `` I met childhood friends who looked 10 years older than I do, just blank faces,'' <PERSON> Botoman </PERSON> said. `` People were desperate. They were standing in lines for bones they would n't feed their dogs here. They were only giving out meat on holidays.'' <PERSON> Simona </PERSON> <PERSON> Simut </PERSON>, a Romanian-American activist in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said a public trial for <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> would n't have worked. `` The people of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> hate him so much that they probably would have just ran to the courtroom and killed him themselves before he even got to a trial,'' she said. A group of Romanian immigrants in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> held a tearful memorial for victims of the revolt at the end of Sunday Mass at the Transfiguration Orthodox Church. <PERSON> Dumitru </PERSON> <PERSON> Manea </PERSON> mourned the dead, but celebrated the country's chances for change. `` Nothing can happen without sacrifice,'' <PERSON> Manea </PERSON> said. `` This is the lesson of history.''

 A jailed leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> escaped from a maximum-security stockade by bribing her guards, a military official said today. <PERSON> Wilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiamzon </PERSON>, wife of party chairman <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiamzon </PERSON>, escaped Monday during Christmas celebrations inside Camp Crame, the Philippine Constabulary headquarters, in suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the official said. The escape was discovered this morning, said Col. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Filler </PERSON>, chief of staff of the Constabulary. A press statement said Mrs. <PERSON> Tiamzon </PERSON>, who was arrested Oct. 2, `` apparently mixed with visitors who were allowed inside the ... jail and slipped without being noticed.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tiamzon </PERSON> allegedly was the head of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, secretary of its <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the executive committee of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and of the Politburo. A $ 46,000 reward had been offered for her capture. Her husband remained at large. `` It seems that they bribed the guards,'' Filler said, adding that a Constabulary officer and three enlisted men were being questioned. `` With regard to the physical security at the camp, I think we have taken every measure to ensure that there will be no other escape.'' <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, escaped from the same stockade in November 1988. <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jopson </PERSON>, escaped while attending the birthday party of camp's jail warden, who has since been replaced. Constabulary chief Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> today ordered the arrest of the officer in charge of the stockade, Capt. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Diego </PERSON>, and three enlisted men for `` laxity.'' <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> also ordered the constabulary's inspector general, Brig.

Two days after <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, he was overthrown by the uprising that began a week earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Bucharest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, were executed Monday after they were found guilty during a secret military trial of genocide and `` grave crimes'' during his tyrannical 24-year rule. <PERSON> Gowhari </PERSON> was dismissed only three months before he was due to return to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was given a red carpet welcome in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s second-biggest trading partner in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and during his visit <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> signed an agreement to buy 1 million barrels of oil a year.

But he stressed that Iranian leaders repeatedly advised <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> to `` bow to his people's demands'' while he was in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. During <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s visit, however, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> praised <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> as `` the sole east European country rigidly adhering to its past government.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported that legislator <PERSON> Hojatoleslamn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadeq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalkhali </PERSON> `` strongly objected to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s visit.'' <PERSON> Khalkhali </PERSON> was president of the revolutionary courts in the early days of the 1979 Islamic revolution and was notorious for sentencing thousands of `` counter-revolutionaries'' to death, often on the flimsiest of pretexts. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has also hotly denied European reports that Iranians were fighting alongside <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s security police against rebel forces and that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had stashed a fortune in gold in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> banks.

<TEXT>
 South African Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> today defended his criticism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s treatment of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and said that former <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders engaged in terrorism in the past. Minister of Religion <PERSON> Zevulun </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> told the Nobel Peace Prize winner that he showed a `` simple lack of understanding'' toward the problems of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Hammer, who held a one-hour meeting with the Anglican leader, was the only <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official to meet with <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> during his five-day Christmas pilgrimage to the Holy Land. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> has visited <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> and the Christian village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahur </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, met with Palestinian leaders and prayed at <ORGANIZATION> Yad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vashem </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s memorial to the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust. Israelis have been highly critical of <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s remarks, and he told reporters that an Israeli shouted, `` Black Nazi pig!'' at him during one rally. When asked if he would condemn Palestinian attacks on Israelis as `` terrorism'' and whether he considered <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a terrorist, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said the definition of terrorism must include military attacks on civilians. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders have practiced terrorism. `` There are people in high positions in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> who did things which they would now call terrorism, for example the bombing of the King <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotel </PERSON>,'' he said. He was referring to the July 1946 bombing that killed 91 Britons, <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> and Jews. The attack on the hotel, which contained British military headquarters, was carried out by the Jewish Irgun underground led by former <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>. `` That was a terrorist act and Mr. Begin later became prime minister,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said he did not meet with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> politicians because of his tight schedule, but added if he had met Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> he would have repeated his call for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to end its harsh treatment of Palestinians. `` I would say to him that I can not myself understand people who have suffered as Jews have suffered inflicting suffering of the kind that I have seen on the Palestinians,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. He rejected Israelis' criticism of his comparison of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oppression of blacks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s treatment of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, which he has repeated throughout his visit. `` Some of the things I have seen here are things I have seen at home,'' he said. `` When I find injustice in the world, whoever perpetrates it must know that I will condemn them. `` If I am accused, as I am often accused, of being anti-Semitic, tough luck,'' he said. Hammer, who joined <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> in an informal news conference after their meeting, said the bishop's views of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> showed `` to my sorrow, a simple lack of understanding.'' `` I tried to explain that with us, in Judaism, and in the State of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, freedom is part of the rights of man and part of our beliefs,'' he said. `` The ones who have been denied their historical rights are us and we are the ones who were persecuted.''

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which had cordial ties with Romanian dictator <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, today joined countries including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that have pledged support for <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new leadership. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and some other governments regretted that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, who were executed in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Monday after a secret military trial, were not tried publicly. The Soviet Foreign Ministry called the executions an internal affair. Spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said the decision `` has probably been made taking into account the aspirations and will of the Romanian people.'' The Dutch government said it was `` concerned'' that the <ORGANIZATION> Ceausescus </ORGANIZATION> had been executed after a secret trial and expressed hope that `` the high principles of the rule of law will find their place in the new <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for which so many have fought to the utmost.'' In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said normal accepted standards were difficult during `` a civil war situation.'' `` Although one may regret a secret trial, at the time it was not really surprising,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who by custom was not identified. `` Dracula Executed,'' blared the banner headline in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Daily Mirror `` Tyrants are Executed,'' said the rival <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today joined at least 13 other nations in pledging support for <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s provisional government, which took over after <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> fled the capital in a helicopter on Friday. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government also said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> would provide immediate humanitarian aid, but it did not elaborate. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was esteemed by Chinese leaders for maintaining good relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> over the decades when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the rest of the Soviet bloc viewed each other with hostility. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was one of the few socialist leaders to praise the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership's crackdown of the student-led pro-democracy movement in June, when hundreds, perhaps thousands were killed by troops in the streets of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said today it recognized the Romanian government and <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> was ready to send medical aid. But it dismissed its ambassador to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> for failing to inform <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> of growing opposition to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> before the Romanian leader visited <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last week. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> said Saturday they would not oppose Soviet bloc intervention to support Romanians fighting against police units loyal to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Monday the provisional government had not for Soviet support. On Monday, food and medical aid began to flow into the hard-hit country. French education minister <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jospin </PERSON> said on French television Monday night: `` Perhaps one would have wished that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> could have been judged and said what he had to say. Naturally we prefer public trials, but these are tragic and at the same time very hopeful events we are seeing now in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.'' Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said: `` The staggeringly high number of casualties reported in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is truly shocking and deplorable. We join the rest of the world in wishing that country and its people the blessings of peace, freedom and well-being.''

 A Romanian immigrant living in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was killed by security forces as he tried to deliver relief supplies in his embattled homeland, family members said. <PERSON> Ionel </PERSON> `` <PERSON> John </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Antimie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 21, a four-year resident of <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION>, was gunned down by forces loyal to executed former Romanian dictator <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> over the weekend, his father, <PERSON> Ionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antimie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> said through an interpreter. The State Department could not immediately confirm the report, but planned an investigation, spokesman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Covington </PERSON> said Monday. The family got the news Christmas morning from friends in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, who were able to get a phone call through to the East European nation and talked with the victim's brother, <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON>, 32, <PERSON> Antimie </PERSON> said. The two brothers had been on a holiday driving tour through <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, their family said, and also had planned to visit <PERSON> Ionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antimie </PERSON>'s girlfriend, <PERSON> Angelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hij </PERSON>, 16, who lives in <LOCATION> Cluj </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, for the holidays. But when news of civil unrest in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> broke, the brothers delayed their journey in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and bought food, medicine and other relief supplies worth `` thousands of dollars,'' <PERSON> Antimie </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> friend told <PERSON> Antimie </PERSON> that the brothers, traveling in a rented car with their supplies, were stopped by uniformed security officers who opened fire, killing <PERSON> Ionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antimie </PERSON> but apparently allowing his brother to flee. <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Antimie </PERSON> told the friend he had returned to the shooting site and recovered his brother's body, his father said. <PERSON> Ionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antimie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> helped run the family's contracting business. He left <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> with his parents, four brothers and two sisters in 1985, according to a sister, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Furdui </PERSON>. Two brothers and one sister stayed behind in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, she said. Tens of thousands of people have died in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in recent weeks during the popular revolt. <PERSON> Ceausecu </PERSON> was executed by firing squad Monday. The Antimie family notified the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Monday. <PERSON> Covington </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will help if it can, but the government does not usually track injuries or deaths of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents who are not citizens.

 Rescuers today searched through charred wreckage at the nation's second-largest petrochemical refinery for a worker missing in the aftermath of an explosion and fire that killed another man. Separately, heating oil futures prices shot higher in early trading today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on speculation that the damage combined with the nation's recent record-setting cold wave would tighten already short home heating oil supplies. `` They are searching now and they'll search through the night in the units where we've gotten clearance to go through,'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Joslin </PERSON> said Monday night. `` We've got to get assurance before we send people back into the dangerous areas.'' Seven people were injured and one contract worker was killed when his pickup truck caught fire 100 to 200 feet from the Christmas Eve explosion. The blast at the plant on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> shattered windows up to six miles away and ignited a fire that raged 15 hours. The name of the missing worker was withheld. Co-workers reported seeing the missing man after the explosion, and officials would n't ruled out the possibility he was n't at the plant. The fire, which burned into Monday morning, engulfed eight storage tanks holding more than 4 million gallons of oil and lubricants, and two separator units, which remove water from oil, the company said. It was believed to have begun in gas that was somehow released, but the cause remained under investigation, said plant Manager <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Galante </PERSON>. Production was halted at the refinery, but <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials said they did not know whether heating oil shortages would worsen as a result. `` Generally, the limit to fuel oil seems to be due to transportation problems in bad weather, and not supplies,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Embry </PERSON>. The refinery has a capacity of more than 19 million gallons of crude oil a day. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the January contract for No. 2 heating oil jumped 4.01 cents a gallon to 85.75 cents in early trading today. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> called out 50 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> overnight to prevent looting of stores where plate-glass windows were blown out. Initial reports said looters hit some stores, but police Lt. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said Monday that there had been no arrests. The dead man was identified as mechanic <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillory </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Irwinville </LOCATION>, an employee for contractor <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Enterprise </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Landmark Supreme Court Ruling: No Citizenship to Messianic Jews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Messianic Jews are not entitled to automatic Israeli citizenship, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled, concluding that their belief in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> makes them Christians instead of Jews. The ruling, published in Israeli newspapers today, was a boost to ultra-Orthodox religious interpretations of the state's 1950 Law of Return. The law forms the basis of Jewish immigration to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The law and its subsequent amendments defines a Jew as a person born to a Jewish mother or who converts to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> and professes no other faith. Orthodox politicians have long sought a more precise definition, and the court's Christmas Day ruling has resolved one issue. The 100-page decision said that belief in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> makes one a member of another faith and ineligible for automatic Israeli citizenship, the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, Hadashot and <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> dailies reported. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Shmaryahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> declined on two occasions today to show the 100-page ruling to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> or comment on its contents. According to the newspapers, Justices <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Elon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Halima </PERSON> acted on an appeal by a South African couple, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Beresford </PERSON>, who belong to a Messianic Jewish sect. Members of such sects often are referred to as `` Jews for <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>.'' The Beresfords challenged a recent refusal by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Deri </PERSON> of the ultra-orthodox <ORGANIZATION> Shas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, to grant them citizenship on grounds they were not Jews. Both Beresfords were born Jewish. The Jewish mainstream rejects the central principle of Christian faith that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was the Messiah. Several small, Messianic Jewish sects, however, do believe in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as Christ while considering their followers as Jews. In their ruling, the Israeli justices rejected this view. `` Messianic Jews attempt to reverse the wheels of history by 2,000 years,'' <PERSON> Elon </PERSON> wrote. `` But the Jewish people has decided during the 2,000 years of its history that -LRB- Messianic Jews -RRB- do not belong to the Jewish nation ... and have no right to force themselves on it. Those who believe in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> are, in fact, Christians.'' The law in question has been a repeated source of tension between secular and religious Jews in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The main quarrel is over attempts by religious leaders to amend the law to recognize only converts to Judaism by Orthodox rabbis. Such a change would make it more difficult for many American and Canadian Jews who belong to Reform and Conservative streams to immigrate.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today directed <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other top party officials to travel to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> to try to heal the break with that independent-minded Baltic republic's party. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Monday bitterly criticized Lithuanian Communists for their declaration of an independent party _ the first crack in the unity forged by <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> before the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. But he also urged caution. Lithuanian Communist leader <PERSON> Algirdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON>, who urged the republic's Dec. 20 break with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, was quoted as telling Lithuanian radio that such a visit by <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> officials would be `` good and useful.'' The two-day meeting of the policy-making party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> found it `` reasonable for Soviet Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to make a trip to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>,'' said an announcement by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other officials will meet with <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party officials and members of the public to find out their opinions on <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s drive for independence. After a visit by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other officials, another <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting will be held to make a firm decision on the dispute with <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. There was no indication when the visits or the next <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting would be. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also approved <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s opening statement to the meeting, in which he mixed tough criticism of <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> and other party officials with calls for restraint and reason Thousands of Lithuanians rallied today in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>' Cathedral Square in support of the split, said <PERSON> Eduardas </PERSON> <PERSON> Potasinskas </PERSON>, an editor at Lithuanian television. <PERSON> Potasinkas </PERSON> also reported on <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON>' comments, saying the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> leader praised the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decision in a radio interview shortly after the meeting ended today. At Monday's meeting, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said: `` No part of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has the right to decide the question about its independent existence with its own program and rules, not taking into account the position of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as a whole. `` And this means that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> was and remains a part of the united <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who is party general secretary as well as the country's president <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, in a report on the first day of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> accused the leaders of the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party as having `` gone over to playing up to nationalist, separatist forces.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tried for several months to head off the split that the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party declared in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, and at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Saturday lashed out at separatists. `` Today, to realize the right to self-determination through secession means to blow up the union, set the people against each other and sow conflict and blood and death,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said at that meeting. `` That's what separatists are pushing us toward.'' He also told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the Soviet government should consider the legal status of public movements that are `` carrying out separatist activities and whipping up nationalist terror.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not identify any such organizations, but in the context of the debate he likely was referring to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations pushing for broad sovereignty and ultimately complete independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> Nevertheless, according to a text of his statement published by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda today, he urged `` maximum restraint'' to allow emotions to calm down.

 A newborn baby girl found abandoned in freezing weather on Christmas Eve was recovering today from frostbite as authorities searched for her mother.

 Government TV today showed the bodies of former President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife after they were executed by a firing squad, and Romanians rejoiced at evidence of the Communist dictator's death. Television also showed a former torture chamber run by his dreaded secret police in the western city of <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>. It said more then 12,000 protesters were killed by the police after the unrest that sparked a popular revolt. The new provisional government today appointed its leader, <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, as chairman of the 37-member governing council. The government also named a prime minister. The videotape showed the <ORGANIZATION> Ceausescus </ORGANIZATION>' bullet-riddled bodies lying against a wall after an earlier sequence of the couple in captivity. A close-up showed <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> lying with blood on the right side of his head. The actual shooting by firing squad was not shown, nor was its location disclosed. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, 71, and his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, 72, were tried by a secret military tribunal and executed Christmas Day for `` genocide'' and other crimes. They were captured Saturday, a day after a popular uprising forced them from power. `` We are people carried away by a very spontaneous process,'' <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> told French television. `` So there was a general demand which pushed us to follow this process, first of all under the pressure of the terrorist groups who wanted to free him.'' The new prime minister, <PERSON> Petre </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON>, told the network the tribunal sentenced <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> to death because officials had information `` concerning possible attacks on the place where he was.'' By trying the couple, putting them to death swiftly and showing the bodies, the revolutionary government apparently was trying to persuade <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s ruthless security troops to surrender to the army, which joined the people in revolt. Thousands have been killed since the revolt began 11 days ago. The new government blamed <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> for the deaths of 60,000 people. The death toll was for the whole of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s 24-year rule, said Romanian sources abroad and a correspondent for the <LOCATION> Yugoslv </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Reports have said as many as 80,000 died in the popular uprising. Hundreds were reported tortured and buried in mass graves, and thousands were killed in some of the fiercest street battles since World War II. The military tribunal said the <ORGANIZATION> Ceausescus </ORGANIZATION> also were convicted of undermining the nation and its economy and attempting to flee with more than $ 1 billion plundered from the people and stashed in foreign banks. The broadcast of the torture chamber showed `` calcinated bodies, pieces of hairy scalps, blood and tortured bodies lying on the floor. The victims were brought here naked,'' an unidentifed commentator said. `` How small were <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s lackeys. They were genuine angels -LRB- compared with the secret police -RRB-,'' he said. This morning, an uneasy calm prevailed in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> with no shooting to be heard for the first time in days and, according to the radio and Romanian sources, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> loyalist forces were surrendering en masse. Power stations, factories, dairies and bakeries have resumed production, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agerpress </ORGANIZATION> said this morning. There was a brief celebration in downtown <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, with cars honking their horns, as government radio announced the appointment of the new leaders, who included <PERSON> Dumitru </PERSON> <PERSON> Maziliu </PERSON> as vice chairman of the governing council. It said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also issued a decree appointing Roman prime minister until elections promised for early next year. Romanian observers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> said they did not know who Roman was. Another decree, also signed by <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, appointed Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Militaru </PERSON> minister of national defense. <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, said to be a close friend of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> from school days in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, is a former senior Communist official whom <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> demoted for speaking out against the dictator. Sporadic fighting in central <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> had continued late into Monday night, driving many people from the streets by the time the executions were announced. TV footage showed <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> being helped out of an armored vehicle by a soldier, then submitting to a blood pressure test. Unshaven, gaunt and visibly tired, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> smiled a few times for the cameras and once patted the hand of his wife and second-in-command, who sat forlornly, a beige fur-lined coat pulled tight around her and her head swathed in a scarf. Romanians at the Intercontinental Hotel clustered eagerly around a TV set as the footage appeared around 1:45 a.m., cheering and even spitting at the television screen at their hated ex-rulers. `` Oh, what wonderful news. The anti-Christ died,'' an unidentified <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> radio announcer exulted minutes after the announcement was made. `` Today, we removed the most hideous tyrant who soiled with blood the history of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>,'' added another unidentified man on radio hours later. Word of the execution came three days after the <ORGANIZATION> Ceausescus </ORGANIZATION> fled <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> by helicopter, toppled by a popular revolt that began Dec. 15 in the western city of <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> with unrest that led to a massacre of anti-government protesters by security forces. Word of the execution, the first of a Communist leader in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> was hanged in 1958 for his part in the 1956 uprising in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, came without warning. Today, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ which had maintained friendly ties with <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> _ joined other countries including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recognizing the new government. Romanian ambassadors in at least 27 countries also declared their support. Food and medical supplies poured in from countries including <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, among the first nations to recognize the new government. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has drawn together ex-Communists, dissident intellectuals and the priest whose threatened arrest sparked the revolt. It has pledged an end to one-party rule and free elections by April. In <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, local army commander <PERSON> Corneliu </PERSON> <PERSON> Vajda </PERSON> said 600 bodies of people slain by security forces had so far been found in mass graves and estimated the total number of dead at 4,670, the <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported, quoting Finnish journalist <PERSON> Marita </PERSON> <PERSON> Vihervuori </PERSON> as its source. Unconfirmed reports of casualties have run as high as tens of thousands. But <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciobanu </PERSON>, health minister under <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and now in opposition to him, said 500 people had died in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> alone over the past four days, with 2,000 wounded. A skittish calm that settled over much of <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> earlier Monday was shattered Christmas night by a flurry of automatic weapons and artillery fire. Heavy explosions boomed near the Intercontinental Hotel in downtown <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. Volleys of sniper fire were answered immediately with staccato bursts of automatic weapons that drowned out the Christmas carols playing for the first time in 42 years on Romanian radio.

 <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, the hard-drinking, hard-nosed former <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> manager whose on - and off-field brawls overshadowed his accomplishments on the baseball diamond, died in an alcohol-related traffic accident He was 61. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was a passenger in a pickup truck that skidded off an icy road in front of his farm Christmas Day. The driver, longtime friend <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, was charged with driving while intoxicted, <LOCATION> Broome </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffo </PERSON> said. Neither man was wearing a seat belt, <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> told authorities. `` It's like losing part of my own family,'' said <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>' principal owner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON>, who hired and fired <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> five times as manager. `` He was one of a kind.'' `` If somebody rubbed wrong against him, he'll punch ya in the nose no sooner than look at him,'' said <PERSON> Yogi </PERSON> <PERSON> Berra </PERSON>, a former teammate and a friend for 40 years. `` But he was a great man, a kind-hearted man and he loved baseball.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> died of a broken neck and spinal cord compression at <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after the 5:45 p.m. crash, according to hospital spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Doll </PERSON>. The truck went off a hairpin curve and came to rest at the driveway of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s 148-acre farm near <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, about 150 miles northwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> line. <PERSON> Ruffo </PERSON> said the hairpin curve has a history of accidents. `` People who live out in that area and use that road know it's there,'' he said today `` But <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> was from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and that could have been a factor that he was n't familiar with the area. If you're not familiar with it, it does n't take much to end up in the ditch. <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>'s Bar near <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s Tiger Stadium, suffered a broken hip and possible broken ribs and was in serious condition at the hospital, Doll said. `` They went way back,'' said <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, 19. A distraught <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> called <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> just after his mother died 10 days ago, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> said. He said his father did n't hesitate to go to his friend's side. <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> had gone to a store and then stopped for a drink, according to Deputy <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Glanville </PERSON>, who issued the citation. An autopsy scheduled to be performed today on <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was canceled at the request of family members, <PERSON> Doll </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was born May 16, 1928, in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. His Italian grandmother called him `` <PERSON> Belli </PERSON>,'' Italian for pretty, and it evolved into <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> played second base for the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> from 1950-57, including five World Series championships. His lifetime batting average for his 11 seasons was just .257, but he always seemed at his best in October. He set a six-game World Series record in 1953 by batting .500 in the series and hitting safely in all six games. He also set a seven-game World Series record by hitting safely in every game of the 1956 Series. `` He was a great little guy,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> legend <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMaggio </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> brought his combative style to the dugout as manager, arguing with players and umpires and getting his teams to play a hard-running game dubbed `` Billy ball.'' But his antics off the field clouded his career. He got into a fight in a topless bar in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on May 6, 1988, hours after being ejected from a game for arguing a call with an umpire. Six weeks later, he was fired by <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON>. Another barroom incident had him back in the headlines just this month. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, in Terre Haute, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, on Dec. 9 to speak at a fund-raiser, was sitting at a bar when someone knocked over a woman's purse containing a .38 - caliber derringer, causing the gun to The bullet whizzed past <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and struck the bar two feet from him. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was first hired to manage the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> in 1975. During that stint, he guided the team to a World Series title in 1977, a season marked by his shoving match with slugger <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Fenway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in June. The next season, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was suspended five days after ignoring <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s instruction to bunt. Five days later, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> lashed out at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON> saying, `` One's a born liar; the other's convicted,'' a reference to <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON>'s guilty plea to violating federal elections laws for a 1972 campaign contribution to President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> resigned in tears a day after his statement. Only five days later, however, <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON> announced he would bring <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> back, a promise he fulfilled the next year. His latest firing was on June 23, 1988, but <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON> retained him as a consultant. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> married his fourth wife, the former <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiver </PERSON>, in January 1988. In an interview last July, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he was enjoying life on the farm and out of the spotlight. During his 16 seasons as an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> manager, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s teams compiled a 1,258-1 ,018 record, a .553 winning He led the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Twins </ORGANIZATION> to an American League West title in 1969 and the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> to an AL East title in 1970. He led the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> to AL pennants in 1976 and 1977 and the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> to an AL West title in 1981. He also managed the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>. A plaque honoring <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Yankee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>'s center field monument area says: `` Casey's Boy,'' a reference to the special affection the late <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stengal </PERSON> had for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` A Yankee Forever,'' the plaque says, `` A man who knew only one way to play _ to win.'' `` <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> was a true <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> _ one of the truest ever,'' said current <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON> Bucky </PERSON> <PERSON> Dent </PERSON>, who played for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> in the 1970s. In addition to his wife, survivors include son <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and daughter, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, both from previous marriages.

<TEXT>
 Nobel Prize-winning author <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>, who created a world of everlasting despair and left theatergoers `` Waiting for Godot,'' died at age 83 of respiratory failure and was buried today, his publisher said. The playwright, poet and novelist whose work depicted death and decay as mankind's sole and inescapable destiny, was buried this morning at <LOCATION> Montparnasse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> in a private ceremony, said publisher <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Linden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> died Friday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, culture minister of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s adopted home, called him `` an immense writer, exceptionally exacting, who has profoundly marked his century.'' The Irish-born author of `` Godot'' and `` Endgame'' rejected the redeeming optimism that might have made him more accessible to a mass audience and gained him earlier recognition as one of the century's greatest writers. His was a stark world peopled with vagabond couples trapped by an apocalyptic sense of doom and caught in a never-ending, master-slave dialectic often laced with wry Irish humor. <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s work was a cry of agony and compassion at the hopeless misery, futility and loneliness of human existence, which he called a slow death. That theme reappears in the dozens of plays, novels, poems and short stories he wrote in both <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> and English during a career that spanned more than 50 years. `` He was a man of great imagination. He was in a sense a quiet leader,'' British playwright <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinter </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was in the forefront of modern literature. He was totally original and a man of great courage, not only in himself, but in his work. His work knew no bounds really. He did n't accept any limitations.'' Critics were scandalized by his experiments on the stage. `` Breath,'' which premiered in 1970, had no actors, no dialogue and no action _ just a heap of gloomily lit garbage cans onstage, a baby's screams and the amplified sound of heavy breathing. The play lasted just 30 seconds. Until French director <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Blin </PERSON> rescued the long-published but never performed `` Waiting for Godot'' from obscurity in 1952, <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s pessimistic and often difficult style limited his audience to an intellectual elite. The play, about two tramps waiting for a third, was a huge success and brought the author instant world renown. It was translated into and performed in more than 20 languages, and it helped <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> win the Nobel Prize for literature in 1969. Always shy and withdrawn, <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> refused to attend the award ceremonies in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. He sent his publisher instead and fled to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> to escape the news media. The citation described <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> as `` a pioneer of a new modesty of expression in fiction and the theater ... whose writing rises like a cry for mercy from all mankind.'' <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> was secretive about his private life. He granted only rare interviews, and was one of the few writers to refuse to appear on `` Apostrophes'' _ <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s most popular book review television show. Even the date of <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s birth was wrapped in mystery. He said he was born in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> on Good Friday, April 13, 1906. But his biographer, <PERSON> Deirdre </PERSON> <PERSON> Bair </PERSON>, suggested he was really born a month earlier, with <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> shifting it to the anniversary of the crucifixion as a symbolic boost to his self-made legend. The son of a surveyor, <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> enjoyed a comfortable, upper-middle class Protestant upbringing. Though he said he had `` a happy childhood,'' he once admitted to `` always feeling lonely.'' He studied modern languages at <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, and first came to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1928 to lecture in Engish at the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superieure </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> he met another Irish exile, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, who was to have a profound influence on his future writing. `` <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> had a moral effect on me,'' <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> said later. `` He made me realize the meaning of artistic integrity.'' After <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> France </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>, died in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> in 1933, his mother urged <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> to drop his literary ambitions and take up some serious profession. To escape her and the middle-class atmosphere of his family, <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> settled permanently in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1937. <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s move came at a time when international tension was mounting, but he said `` I preferred <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> at war to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> at peace.'' In 1938, <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> was stabbed in a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> street brawl. A deep knife wound pierced his lung and narrowly missed his heart. A pianist passing by on her bicycle stopped to help the gravely injured man and have him taken to hospital. The girl, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Deschevaux-Dumesnil </PERSON>, though six years his senior, became his lifelong companion and they finally married in secret in 1961. Ms. <PERSON> Deschevaux-Dumesnil </PERSON> died July 17 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> at the age of 89. The couple had no children. During World War II the couple worked with the underground Resistance movement in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> was awarded the Croix de Guerre with a gold star in 1945. <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>, who all his life shunned politics, later said he joined the Resistance not to help <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> win the war, but `` to fight the Germans who were making life hell for my friends.'' Indeed, despite his rejection of the limelight, <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> was a loving and loyal friend. He would spend hours in <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> cafes listening to his painter friends _ including <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Velde </PERSON> brothers, the English painter <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>' brother -RRB- and <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Giacometti </PERSON> _ talk about their work He also met <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s leading Surrealist writers and eventually translated several poems of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Eluard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Breton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> was not just a serious intellectual, and he was known as the man who preferred referring a newspaper's sports pages to reviews of his own plays. <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> attributed his success to an `` intuitive sense of despair,'' rather than to talent. He once described himself as `` doomed to spend the rest of my days digging up the detritus of my life and vomiting it out over and over again. `` Optimism is not my way. I shall always be depressed, but what comforts me is the realization that I can now accept this dark side as the commanding side of my personality,'' he said. In later plays written in French and first performed on the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> stage, <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> developed his theme of man's losing battle against destiny. In `` Endgame,'' a blind paralytic laments his fate while his senile and crippled parents die of despair in garbage cans. `` There are no landmarks in my work,'' he said. `` We are all adrift. We must invent a world in which to survive, but even this invented world is pervaded by fear and guilt. Our existence is hopeless.''

 The Deep South's deep freeze began abating today, melting Christmas snow that fell as far south as the Gulf Coast, but thousands of people were without water as frozen, cracked water pipes and mains thawed and leaked. Temperatures stayed below freezing overnight throughout much of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. It was 30 degrees in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, at 4 a.m. EST. But temperatures were expected to reach the 60s in the Carolinas by the end of the week, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The roads are passable, but it's a sheet of ice in most places,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozier </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Dare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, sheriff's department A new cold front, not as severe as the one that set hundreds of low temperature records last week, swung down from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and snow fell today in an arc from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. West of that air mass, the weather was mild in many places and <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, had a reading of 36 above zero at 6 a.m. During the weekend, a rare Southern blizzard brought up to 15 inches of snow to <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the most ever measured there, but much of that was expected to melt today with highs in the 40s. It was the first white Christmas in more than a century in the coastal city, in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and in Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, on the Gulf Coast. Snow also dusted northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Citrus growers in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> reported extensive crop damage. Officials in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> estimated 70 percent of the state's citrus crop and 80 percent of the winter vegetable crop was destroyed when the temperatures plunged into the low 20s and upper teens as the holiday weekend began. Citrus losses are estimated at $ 200 million so far and could top $ 500 million as trees begin to show effects from the freeze, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvan </PERSON>, district director of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials had n't released citrus loss figures yet today, but damage is likely to be substantial to the state's $ 3.5 billion crop since much of it was still on the trees when freezing temperatures began Saturday. Strawberry crops suffered less damage. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, airlines resumed normal schedules at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> today after reducing flights because of the snow, an airport spokeswoman said. The <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jetport </LOCATION>, closed for a third straight day Monday, also was expected to resume operations sometime later today; the jetport can operate only during daylight because runway lights are covered with snow, said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, deputy airport director. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, appealed to families in a six-county area to shut off Christmas tree lights to save energy. Other <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> utilities imposed rotating brownouts, and in some caes, blackouts. More than 60,000 homes and businesses in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, were without water or had greatly reduced pressure because of water-main breaks and because the <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> had frozen around intakes for the municipal water system. The city government was closed because of the water problem. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cities also had broken water pipes, with more than 6,000 leaks reported in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, and some people had been without water since Friday. Hotels in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> offered discount rates for people who wanted to take showers. Taps also ran dry in the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, area. `` There's got to be thousands of broken lines out there,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinard </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s public works department, which supplies water to 400,000 people. `` We've got water mains and pipes bursting all over the city, everything from hotels to businesses to homes,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, a fire chief in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. At least 93 deaths from the <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> have been blamed on the cold since Dec. 15 Victims this weekend included an 18-year-old boy who fell through ice on a lake in <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and a 7-week-old boy who froze to death in his crib in an unheated apartment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Police said they may charge the parents, who left the baby unattended after an argument. The Plains celebrated Christmas with a respite from subzero temperatures, but a fresh blast of arctic chill blew across the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and upper Great Lakes late Monday, dropping as much as 10 inches of snow in parts of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Christmas Day was the coldest day ever in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, where it fell to zero degrees. Its previous all-time low was 5 degrees in February 1899. Records also were set Monday for the date in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with lows of 29 in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, 30 in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and 46 in <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Farther north, the cold prevented the annual re-enactment of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s crossing of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to capture <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> troops at <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` We could n't get our four boats into the river because it was a sheet of ice,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, who has played the role of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since 1985. And in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, organizers who struggled for three years to stage a Winterfest of snow sculpting and ice skating despite balmy temperatures gave up this year and canceled the festival _ and then the snow began. With nearly 3 feet of snow so far this season, <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> had its first white Christmas since 1985. `` Someone just called me and said, ` Ca n't you bring it back? Then we wo n't have any snow,''' said <PERSON> Dottie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Place </ORGANIZATION>, which had been one of the sponsors. It was n't cold all over the country, though. In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, surfers got to try out new gift surfboards on Christmas as temperatures peaked in the low 80s. `` All I want to do is swim and enjoy the heat,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> as she stepped off a plane at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes today raided a major <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> command post south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and police said at least three people were killed. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said it destroyed the base. The air strike came just hours after <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> paratroopers backed by tanks and air cover swept deep into southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, killing guerrillas and wiping out another Lebanese Communist base. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the Israeli military command said the Communist command post at <LOCATION> Rmeile </LOCATION>, 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, was destroyed in the air raid. `` At the terrorist target ... there are dead and wounded,'' the army said, adding that the Israeli fighter jets returned safely to their bases. No further details were released. Lebanese police said at least three people were killed and seven wounded in the five-minute air raid. Israeli authorities said there were no Israeli casualties in either attack. Six Phantom F-4 fighter bombers attacked Rmeile, and guerrillas fired several heat-seeking SAM-7 anti-aircraft missiles that were deflected by balloons released by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> pilots, police reported. Earlier today, paratroopers attacked a Communist base which the army described as a terrorist target used as a launching pad for anti-Israeli attacks. That attack was the Israeli army's biggest ground operation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in more than a year. The later air raid was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 17th such strike in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. At least 18 people were killed and 109 wounded in the previous 16 air raids. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, police said army sappers defused a car packed with 165 pounds of explosives near Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' office. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, was at home five blocks away when the bomb was discovered, and police said it appeared he was not the target. A police spokesman said it was defused a half-hour before it was set to go off. `` A bloodbath has been averted,'' said the spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations. The guerrilla base at <LOCATION> Nabi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Safa </LOCATION>, in the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> 7 -LCB- miles north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed `` security zone'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was manned by the Moscow-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Israeli army's attack was its biggest ground operation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since an assault against the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> Dec. 9, 1988. The attack force of about 100 commandos pushed out from the border enclave, occupied by the Israelis since 1985, in four tanks and eight armored personnel carriers at 2 a.m. behind a massive artillery barrage, police reported. The attackers stormed through the villages of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meshki </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebbaya </LOCATION> in the eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> after two helicopter gunships blasted them with eight rockets, destroying many houses, the spokesman said. He can not be named under standing regulations. Forty other commandos were then dropped by helicopters in <LOCATION> Nabi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Safa </LOCATION>, where they blew up the Communists' two-story command post after raking the base with machine-gun fire, the spokesman added. He said the attackers pulled back into the security zone two hours after the attack began. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out the two - to 15-mile wide border enclave to curb guerrilla raids following its army's withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> three years after it invaded in 1982 The 2,500-man <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> holds the enclave along with an estimated 1,500 Israeli troops. The Israeli assault came amid heavy fighting in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> between two rival Shiite Moslem factions, the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, and the Syrian-allied Amal. Police have reported at least 38 people killed and 150 wounded in four days of battles in a power struggle for control of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.

 Here is a selection of quotations from the writings of <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>, the playwright who died Friday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 From `` Waiting for Godot'': We are all born mad. Some remain so. Estragon: Let's go. Vladimir: We ca n't. Estragon: Why not? Vladimir: We're waiting for Godot. Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful!
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 From `` <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> Dies'': Death must take me for someone else. To be buried in lava and not turn a hair, it is then a man shows what stuff he is made of. To know he can do better next time, unrecognizably better, and that there is no next time, and that it is a blessing there is not, there is a thought to be going on with.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 From `` All that Fall'': This dust will not settle in our time. And when it does some great roaring machine will come and whirl it all sky-high again.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 From `` Endgame'': Clov: Do you believe in the life to come? <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON>: Mine was always that.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 From `` Murphy'': There is no return game between a man and his stars.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 From `` Stirrings Still,'' <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s last published work: A clock afar struck the hours and half-hours. The same as when among others <PERSON> Darly </PERSON> once died and left him. Strokes now clear as if carried by a wind now faint on the still air. Cries afar now faint now clear. Head on hands half hoping when the hour struck that the half-hour would not and half fearing that it would not. Similarly when the half-hour struck. Similarly when the cries a moment ceased. Or merely wondering. Or merely waiting. Waiting to hear.

<HEAD>Riot Charges Overturned on Three Racial Attack Defendants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Misdemeanor riot convictions against three teen-agers in connection with the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> racial attack, in which a black man was killed, have been overturned on appeal. The three-page decision by a panel of <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> Division judges on the three defendants convicted in 1988 was handed down Dec. 11 and reported in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Three other youths were convicted in a separate trial of manslaughter and assault in the fatal racial attack. The case involved an attack on Dec. 20, 1986, by a group of white males on several blacks, one of whom, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, was chased onto a busy highway, where he was hit by a car and killed. The defendants, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollander </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Farino </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Povinelli </PERSON>, were sentenced in September 1988 to 34 days in jail to be served on weekends over a four-month period. They were acquitted of a more serious felony riot charge. Under the ruling, the indictments and convictions of the three are thrown out. Prosecutors can resubmit the case to a grand jury or drop the charges. A lawyer for the three defendants, <PERSON> Spiros </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsimbinos </PERSON>, said today he had not yet seen the ruling. The appellate judges reversed the conviction because of errors in the verdict sheets provided to the jury and because the trial judge, Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demakos </PERSON>, failed to give the panel the option of finding the three guilty of disorderly conduct, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 days.

 Police stormed a cell block controlled by drug traffickers holding 18 hostages, and six traffickers were killed and five hostages wounded, authorities said today. Police late Monday gained the release of all of the hostages, including two children, and the situation at the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Picota </LOCATION> jail in southern <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> had returned to normal, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The spokesman asked not to be identified so he would not become the target of revenge by any of the prisoners involved. The rescue came after two days of fruitless negotiations with the prisoners, who had taken the hostages after a failed jailbreak Sunday. The prisoners subdued guards during visiting hours at the jail and were putting on their uniforms in an attempt to escape, <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported today. The paper, quoting prison sources, said authorities discovered the plan and sealed off the cell block before the prisoners, all held on drug trafficking charges, could flee. The trapped criminals then took hostages, including some civilians who had been visiting their jailed family members, and made a series of protests and demands, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION> reported. The paper said the prisoners began by protesting the death of <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, the trafficker of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel who was killed Dec. 15 in a gunfight with police on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s northern coast. The prisoners said they would release the hostages only if the administration of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> agreed to end its extradition of drug traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> said. The administration has extradited 11 drug suspects since August when it decreed the policy. The prisoners also demanded a meeting with the Colombian Justice Minister, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> and other officials. They said that they wanted to be transferred to another, less crowded jail, <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official reached by telephone said he could not confirm the details of the takeover.

<HEAD>Blue Laws Have Liquor Sellers Singing New Year's Blues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 It's 9:59 p.m. on New Year's Eve in Little Rock, Ark. At a downtown bar, the revelers are already chanting the countdown: `` ... four ... three ... two ... one ... It's closing time!'' New Year's Eve or not, when it's Sunday in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, the bar closes at 10. Most states have some sort of law restricting liquor sales on Sundays. So when New Year's Eve falls on a Sunday, as it does this year, it's a less-than-festive holiday for those who make a living selling alcohol. `` I think it will hurt the industry,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezzo </PERSON>, who owns a liquor store in <LOCATION> Glastonbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` We're very, very pessimistic.'' In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, as in many states in the Northeast, bars and restaurants can serve alcohol on Sundays but liquor stores can not. For New Year's Eve, <PERSON> Brezzo </PERSON> is hoping his customers will buy what they need on Saturday _ but he's far from confident. `` Nobody knows what to expect,'' he said. `` Everybody's sort of sitting on the edge of their seat.'' Liquor stores in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> are posting signs to remind their customers to buy early. In Grand Forks, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Happy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> is taking out newspaper advertisements with a similar reminder. Still, owner <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershman </PERSON> said, `` No matter how much advertising you do, and how much you try to tell people, there are still 60 percent of the people who do n't pay attention and will show up at the last minute.'' Although <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> has among the nation's toughest blue laws, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> did agree this year to allow bars and taverns to apply for special Sunday permits. But some communities, such as <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, opted against issuing the permits, much to the dismay of bar owners. `` We're put in an unfair disadvantage to the other major cities,'' complained <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellow </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, which caters to Canadian tourists. `` The people I have talked to are bypassing <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION> and heading to Bismark or <LOCATION> Williston </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, where restaurants and nightclubs ca n't sell alcohol between 2 a.m. and midnight Sunday, some places will hold parties the night before. Others will start their festivities at midnight. As in several other Southern states, private clubs are exempted from the law. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pie </ORGANIZATION>, a 2-month-old Montgomery nightclub without a private license, said he'd throw a bash on Saturday night. `` But it's just not going to have the same whiz-bang as New Year's Eve,'' he said. `` Obviously, it's a big loss. A day-before-New Year's Eve party, that sounds pretty goofy.'' Some states, such as <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, specifically exempt New Year's Eve from blue laws. In <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, liquor store owners successfully sued this year to open, arguing that a convoluted liquor law was intended to exempt New Year's Eve from Sunday restrictions but unintentionally had the opposite effect. `` We're real happy. The customers are happy,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Button </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, after a judge ruled that the stores could open. `` It's the second biggest day of the year for us -LRB- after Christmas Eve -RRB- It would have cost us a lot of money.'' In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the executive director of the state Hotel and <ORGANIZATION> Motel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said she feared that restrictions on public venues selling liquor on Sundays would lead to an increase in drunken driving. `` What happens is so many people ... might have spent the night in the hotel rather than drinking and partying and driving on the road,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, the association's executive director. Others noted that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s blue laws send some people over the border into less-restrictive <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to drink. Not all liquor sellers are upset about being forced to close. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, the owner of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liquor </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said he was quite content to spend this New Year's Eve in the quiet of his own home. <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> said he was n't worrying about any loss in business. `` It's just going to be nicer for me,'' he said.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Business executives, bank officers, attorneys, real estate brokers and even car dealers have been drafted into the war on drugs _ whether they like it or not. Armed with stiff new regulations passed under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and other federal agencies are forcing businesses and financial institutions to help track the estimated $ 220 million in profits generated daily by illegal drug sales in this country. `` All that cash does no good stored in boxes. They have to turn it around. That necessarily involves legitimate businesses,'' said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Intriago </PERSON>, who has started a publication that promises to make sense of the regulatory maze and keep subscribers on the right side of the law. `` The government has conscripted the entire business community and required them to submit their paper trails,'' <PERSON> Intriago </PERSON> said. `` It's saying, ` OK, you're in the war now _ play by the rules or face severe penalties.''' Money Laundering Alert is an eight-page monthly newsletter of advice, statistics and reports on what criminals do to hide the source of their money and what government is doing to uncover their schemes. As trade journals go, Alert has a sizeable niche, says <PERSON> Intriago </PERSON>, a former chief counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that oversees all banking regulatory agencies. He also has prosecuted white-collar criminals and drug traffickers as an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Amid growing calls for the legalization of drugs and evidence that interdiction efforts have failed to reduce the cocaine flowing into this country, money laundering controls have become the government's weapon of choice, <PERSON> Intriago </PERSON> said. `` The money laundering initiative has a higher probability of success than the others, such as interdiction. It hits the profit motive,'' he said. Enlisting the help of banks and other often unwitting handmaidens to drug traffickers has already yielded impressive results. Days before billionaire <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel enforcer <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> was gunned down in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> on Dec. 15, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Swiss officials traced his profits and were able to freeze $ 61.8 million of his assets in several countries. Under money laundering laws, banks are required to report large cash transactions. Soon, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> could also force banks to put names and addresses on the estimated $ 1.25 trillion transferred daily around the world on telephone lines. Details of that initiative are laid out in Alert's November issue. These new money laundering laws are still in their infancy and many have yet to be enforced. Many otherwise law-abiding businesses may be unaware of the penalties they face, <PERSON> Intriago </PERSON> said. Alert costs $ 295 a year, but <PERSON> Intriago </PERSON> notes that the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> can now impose $ 500 fines for every negligent error a bank teller makes on one of the required forms. `` Tell me these institutions would n't like to receive a publication that could spare them thousands of dollars in fines, to say nothing of the bad publicity,'' <PERSON> Intriago </PERSON> said. With the fourth issue going to press, Alert has more than 200 subscribers, ranging from banks, thrifts and credit unions to lawyers and accountants, foreign governments and diplomatic offices. <PERSON> Intriago </PERSON> does n't mention `` drug kingpins'' on his list, and he bristles at the suggestion that his newsletter could be as useful to criminals as to law-abiding citizens. `` We do n't do criminal background checks on our subscribers, nor does The Wall Street Journal,'' he said. `` A number of criminal defense attorneys have subscriptions, however.'' One of those attorneys sits on the newsletter's editorial board as well: <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, who represented Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> when he was indicted on drug trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` He's a very respected attorney,'' <PERSON> Intriago </PERSON> said, `` no matter what his clientele is.''

<TEXT>
 An unsigned poster mocking deposed Romanian leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s hard-line leaders went up at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, birthplace of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s spring democracy movement, a source confirmed Tuesday. `` Lost dog,'' read the poster, which was put up over the weekend after <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s flight from his palace in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> and before his arrest and execution. It said the dog, named <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, might be coming to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to join four other dogs _ a reference to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>. The poster, which authorities swiftly took down, violated martial law regulations in force since May, when <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students led massive protests for democratic reform in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> ordered the army into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in June to crush the protests, leaving hundreds and possibly thousands dead. It was the third illegal `` big character poster'' in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> this month, according to Chinese and Western sources. One urging students to remember those killed in June went up at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in early December, and another appeared briefly inside the residential compound of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. That poster read: `` Down with the illegal <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> government.'' At a Dec. 8 dance, students at the drama school also played songs about the June crackdown from a U.S.-recorded album titled `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 1989,'' the sources said. No arrests have been reported in connection with any of the incidents. However, at least six and possibly eight people were arrested Dec. 9 when students from the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> unfurled a banner reading: `` Motherland, why are you so poor?'' The incidents indicate that anger over June's events has not subsided, despite intense political education and a scaling down of the troop presence in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. If anything, tensions have increased as authorities have increased controls. Among other measures, students say the government appears to be closing the door slowly on study abroad for all except state-sponsored students by making it impossible for other students to take the necessary tests or obtain college transcripts. In this atmosphere, news of the democratic changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has been greeted with pleasure but also bitterness by some Chinese students that their movement did not also succeed. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s uprising has aroused the greatest excitement, because it was the only other country where hard-line Communist leaders resorted to violence. At one college, some students held a party to celebrate <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s ouster. The official news media has carried only sparse reports on the uprising and omitted any explanation of its cause. At least one hotel in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> stopped selling foreign newspapers late last week after the uprising began, apparently because of their reports from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. But hotels were not stopped from showing satellite transmissions of foreign TV networks such as <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. Chinese workers at one hotel clustered silently around a TV set Tuesday as <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> showed the bodies of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife after their execution. `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will be next _ that is my prediction,'' said one Chinese intellectual, who was gleeful over <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s downfall. But he did not believe <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would follow in the domino-like toppling of hard-line leaders. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is too big and poor,'' he said, a widespread sentiment. Others speculated it would only make Chinese leaders more convinced of the correctness of their June crackdown and the need for tighter surveillance.

Col. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murgia </PERSON> said 440 <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalist troops and about the same number of weapons were captured in airborne assaults Monday on <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 200 miles to the west, and <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION>, just southwest of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He also said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s intelliegence chief, Col. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, surrendered Monday. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> had been arrested after a coup attempt in October, but was released. <PERSON> Murgia </PERSON> said 30,000 pounds of emergency medical supplies had arrived in the past day and civilian relief agencies would send workers starting today to help with redistribution. Twenty-three American soldiers are known to have died and another 330 wounded, <PERSON> Murgia </PERSON> said. The figures for the number of wounded rose because of late-arriving reports, he said. Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependents were killed. Panamanian casualties were listed as 293 killed, 123 wounded and 4,446 captured, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military authorities. Panamanian doctors said more than 100 civilians were killed and hundreds more injured. Heavy fighting was reported overnight near a downtown sector where many embassies are located, and the building housing the <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> was burned. Bank officials and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers said the blaze started after American troops returned fire coming from the building. There also was fighting near <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tomas </LOCATION> hospital close to the American Embassy. Caches of arms and ammunition have been found hidden in the hospital in recent days. Small arms and mortar fire were heard near the Cuban Embassy, which was surrounded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, where the U.S.-installed government of President <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> has set up shop. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> today said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers surrounding its embassy violated international law and asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for help in ending the situation, Cuban diplomats and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, elected in May balloting that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> nullified, moved Monday to consolidate his authority. First Vice President <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said a governor had been appointed for six of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 10 provinces. Presidential spokeswoman <PERSON> Anel </PERSON> <PERSON> Belis </PERSON> called on government workers to go back on the job today. Government services have largely been paralyzed since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> invaded one week ago to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Dozens of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and armored vehicles encircled the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> mission after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> entered it Sunday. Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said he ordered the embassy surrounded to prevent <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters from `` blowing into the place.'' Reporters saw soldiers using pellet guns to shoot out street lights on the avenue running by the mission late Monday. They left just four lamps lit. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said Monday that `` concerned parties,'' including the <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> government, would examine <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s case. Asked if a `` simple'' turnover of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was foreseeable, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> replied, `` Well, I do n't think so. There is n't an extradition treaty.'' Sources in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> mentioned the possibility of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> going to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. But in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> was quoted as saying, `` <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is not the ideal country to accept <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> because of its extradition agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which includes drug trafficking -LRB- cases -RRB-.'' American troops had surrounded the Cuban, Libyan and Nicaraguan embassies to prevent <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from seeking refuge there, but none were at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> building when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> arrived Sunday afternoon. Asked why, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told a news briefing in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, `` We had our hands full carrying out our basic mission.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said he would like to bring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops home `` as soon as possible,'' but he added, `` They will stay as long as they are needed.'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s new foreign minister, <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion would ensure that the 1977 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Treaties are fulfilled `` as they were signed. In other words, on December 31, 1999 -LRB- the canal -RRB- will revert to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, as well as all its installations.'' A Panamanian officer who also faces drug-related charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was escorted to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Monday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agents, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> surrendered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Saturday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops arrested <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Rognoni </PERSON>, a commerce minister under <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, according to witnesses who saw him being taken from his house. It was not known why he was apprehended. American military officials said most of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> had surrendered and that the resistance of his loyalists had dwindled. Helicopters dropped thousands of `` safe conduct passes'' in resistance areas for those who wanted to turn themselves in to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops at the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and the ambassador's residence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> are refusing <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> diplomats the right to leave or enter either location and are engaging in threatening military activities, a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> official said today. In response, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces `` do not intend to prevent normal diplomatic activity by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> personnel. Charges to the contrary are not true.'' The department said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are stationed around the Cuban Embassy and several other places in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for security reasons. The statement did not address the specific question of access to the Cuban missions or the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> claim that the troops were engaged in threatening activities. <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pino </PERSON>, spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic mission here, said the situation is particularly serious at the ambassador's residence, where the Cuban diplomats and their families have been staying since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion last week Supplies of food and medicine are running low and the sense of unease among those at the residence has been aggravated by overflights of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes and helicopers, he said. The situation is `` becoming grave,'' <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> said, adding that any incident could provoke `` unforeseeable consequences.'' He said his government has `` protested insistently'' to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities. He had no estimate of the number of Cubans at the residence. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government was informed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> over the weekend that the situation would be resolved shortly. But there was no change as of late morning today, <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said he had no information that Cubans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were being denied the right to enter or leave the embassy grounds. He said a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> reportedly told a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> radio station on Saturday that access to and from the residence was not a problem. But <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops began blocking access both ways that same afternoon. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, asking not to be identified, said the troops outside the residence and the chancery are providing security at those locations. But <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> said Cuban diplomats were told by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officer in charge outside the residence that his instructions were `` to prevent anybody from leaving or entering the embassy.'' He identified the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officer only as Major Acksun. Initially <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had been concerned that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might try to seek refuge in either the Cuban or Nicaraguan embassies in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The installations of both countries were surrounded late last week, prompting the Nicaraguan government to dispatch two tanks to the American Embassy in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> turned himself in to the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> City Sunday afternoon. <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop presence at the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> ambassador's residence has been reinforced since then.

<HEAD>Sakharov Last Speech Called for Pre-Trial Rights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, in the speech he was writing when he died, said legislation allowing prosecutors to prolong maximum pre-trial detention threatened society with a return to Stalinist times, a report said. The respected weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION>, in its Dec. 27 editions, published a text of the speech that it said the Nobel Peace Prize winner was working on when he collapsed and died in his study Dec. 14. Other Soviet publications have said a text of the final speech of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was circulated last weekend at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> would have given the speech, but they have not published it <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> did not say how it obtained the text. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said that by trying to lengthen the amount of time Soviets can be held before trial, the procurator general's office was trying to `` free its hands entirely and return the country to the stormy times of illegality of the cult of personality, stagnation and other rather gloomy periods.'' The `` cult of personality'' is a reference to the rule of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, during which prosecutors unencumbered by legal tradition or judicial oversight had all of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s potential opponents and many other Soviets imprisoned or killed. The maximum length of time a suspect may be held has been nine months, after which only the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet could prolong detention. The new law allows the deputy procurator general to extend such detention to one year, and for the country's top prosecutor to extend it to 18 months. For decades prisoners in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have had no access to a lawyer during most of their pre-trial detention. Soviet practice has been to allow the presence of a defense lawyer to prepare for trial only after the prosecutor has finished questioning the suspect and building his case. `` This will not improve the results of the war with crime, but only make our already sick society more cruel,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s text said. `` The whole country will justly see a new lie in the new law.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> cited the laws of many Western countries limiting the amount of time suspects can be held without trial. He criticized Vice President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON> for what he said were irregularities in conducting the Supreme Soviet legislative session Nov. 28 at which the new law was approved. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, 68, was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies in March, and during the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> session earlier on Dec. 14 had spoken out in favor of declaring a group of reform-minded deputies a `` political opposition'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government.

<HEAD>Exile in Third Country Appears Likely Solution to Noriega Case</HEAD>

 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> likely will allow Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to go into exile in another country rather than turn him over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face drug trafficking charges, sources said Tuesday. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats were at work Tuesday to resolve the diplomatic stalemate involving <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who took refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Sunday after four days of eluding American invasion troops. An embassy spokesman said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the Holy See, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melady </PERSON>, has been discussing the case with high-ranking <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials but gave no details. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s deputy spokesman, <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Piero </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennacchini </PERSON>, said contacts were under way between the concerned parties, including the newly installed <LOCATION> Panamian </LOCATION> government, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` It's very delicate situation,'' <PERSON> Pennacchini </PERSON> said. `` It has to be treated with much discretion to find the best solution for all of the parties.'' A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Monday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had demanded `` in extraordinarily tough terms'' that the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> turn <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> custody for trial on drug charges. But church authorities had rebuffed the request and were trying, so far unsuccessfully, to find another country to take <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> official said. `` We want him alive to stand trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, said. `` We see this as a criminal matter. This is not a case of poltitical or religious persecution.'' But a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> diplomatic source, who is close to those involved in negotiations, on Tuesday said the possibility of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> handing over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities was `` very dim'' and he would more likely go to another country. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> have been mentioned as possible refuges. A senior <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official, who is not directly involved in the case but follows foreign policy issues, said `` no rules of any kind'' would permit the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to turn over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion forces. `` They could only hand him over to the country where he's held or arrange safe passage to another country,'' said the official, adding that exile in a third country was the more likely solution of the two. He noted that the issue of granting asylum for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is not new. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s representatives had negotiated with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the past and again this year about the possibility of stepping down and taking up exile in another country. The official also wondered how eager <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is to bring <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trial, referring to published reports that he might reveal embarrassing details of former links with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, chief <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said `` I do n't think so'' when asked if the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> would simply turn over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to the Americans, noting the Holy See does not have an extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There were reports from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> was having trouble finding another country to accept <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Spanish newspapers Tuesday quoted the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> <PERSON> Escribano </PERSON>, as saying <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has formally denied <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> political asylum. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> told the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> EFE </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> was not the ideal country for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> because of its extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Sources indicated it was likely a deal was struck between <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the Vatican Ebassy before he took refuge there. Under this scenario, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sought guarantees that he would not be turned over to the Americans, while the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> demanded that he renounce the conflict in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. In fact, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sought refuge at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> mission `` after having expressed his will to end the conflict.'' The spokesman indicated the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> knew of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s position before he showed up at the embassy. Analysts noted that it was unlikely <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would have gone to the embassy if there was any chance he would be turned over the Americans. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> stressed that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s move marked an opportunity to bring peace to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` The legal aspect is certainly interesting,'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said on Monday. `` But more important is the announcement that now, with his -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s -RRB- declared intention to contribute to the pacification of the whole country, one can bring an end to the violence.''

 A Panamanian officer accused of helping deposed dictator <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> smuggle cocaine for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel was jailed in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> today after surrendering in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON>, who commanded a <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> unit in the province of <LOCATION> Chiriqui </LOCATION>, was placed in the custody of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents after he surrendered Saturday, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON>, an agency spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He was flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under tight security Monday and held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> pleaded innocent to drug-related charges today before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> and was ordered held without bond pending a Jan. 2 hearing. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON>, 46, repeated his claim that he turned himself in to fight the charges. `` I surrender myself. I wanted to be brought here,'' he told the judge through a translator. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s attorneys, said he came to the court session today to monitor the situation and arrange to speak with del Cid, who is now represented by a public defender. <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> said he does not think he will defend del Cid. `` We are confident that we have the evidence to convict him,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtenin </PERSON> said at a news conference this morning before heading to del Cid's first court appearance. <PERSON> Lehtenin </PERSON> described del Cid as one of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s `` righthand men'' and said he was the ousted <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader's liaison, courier and emissary in drug trafficking deals with Colombian drug lords. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> was one of 15 <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> associates named in an indictment unsealed Feb. 5, 1988, by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He was wanted on four counts related to cocaine possession and laundering drug profits, the spokeswoman said. According to the indictment, del Cid acted as a liaison and money courier between <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The indictment accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of accepting a $ 4.6 million bribe from the organization to protect shipments of cocaine, launder money, supply drug laboratories and shield drug traffickers from the law. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on charges of taking a separate $ 5.4 million bribe from the <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> drug cartel. If convicted on all counts, del Cid could be sentenced to 70 years in prison and fined $ 550,000, according to <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>'s office. After <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON>'s surrender, he declared loyalty to the government of <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, installed as president last week after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops invaded <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power. He remained in custody in the Central American country until <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents escorted him to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` Normally he would have been flown in by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals, but this was not an ordinary case,'' Ms. <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he would be tried first in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> because the prosecutors' case there was stronger than in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>.

 A group led by the cousin of U.S.-backed Panamanian President <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> sent its first shipment of medical supplies to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Tuesday and announced further plans to send medicine and food. The estimated $ 50,000 worth of supplies, including plasma and antibiotics, was accompanied by a physician to help distribute the items at <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s two main hospitals. `` We realize this is just a small amount of what's needed, but at this point anything is a help. These supplies are urgently needed,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, whose cousin was sworn in as president last week after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion toppled the government of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The supplies, mostly donated to the Help <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> group from several <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> hospitals, were packed in boxes and filled nearly every available space aboard the twin-engine Lear 25 jet. Other items sent included syringes and needles, intravenous solutions and orthopedic devices. Dr. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyna </PERSON> said he would spend several hours in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to allocate the 2,500 pounds of supplies before returning late Tuesday to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. <PERSON> Reyna </PERSON> said the group hopes the campaign for medical and food provisions will expand nationwide. `` The next flight, I hope we have a 747,'' he said. Help <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> also has opened accounts at two <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> banks to take donations, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said. A cargo ship with six 40-foot containers of food is expected to leave <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Friday for the four-day voyage to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, he said. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> sent medical supplies aboard a C-5 cargo plane to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to aid injured civilians. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military has not released figures on civilian casualites or injuries. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said he plans to continue relief and fund-raising efforts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and does not foresee a direct role in his cousin's government. The situation at Panamanian hospitals was complicated by the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime using medical supply areas to hide arms, according to <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, who was named the Panamanian consul in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Tuesday. `` It's going to take a lot more shipments like these to return the hospitals to where they should be,'' <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON> said.

 Temperatures rose and snow melted Tuesday in the South, but thousands of people had no water or little pressure because of pipes cracked by the record cold wave. Temperatures stayed below the freezing point overnight throughout much of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, but were expected to reach the 60s in the Carolinas by the end of the week, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said.

The <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jetport </LOCATION>, closed for a third straight day Monday, was able to operate only during daylight because runway lights were covered by snow, said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, deputy airport director. At least 96 deaths from the Plains to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> had been blamed on the cold since Dec. 15. The worst of the water problems was at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, where an estimated 60,000 homes and businesses were without water or had greatly reduced pressure. Frozen pipes had cracked but the biggest problem was that the <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> had frozen around intakes for the municipal water system. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s city government closed Tuesday because of the water problem and several businesses that normally use a lot of water agreed to close Tuesday or reduce operations. Mayor <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditto </PERSON> said that with luck, water could restored to all areas by late Wednesday. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cities also had broken water pipes, with more than 6,000 leaks reported in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Some people had been without water since Friday. Plumbers were besieged with calls. `` The wait could be a week, if not longer,'' said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>'s A-1 Redi Rooter Plumbing in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. `` It depends on how fast we can get to them and how fast we can get parts in.'' `` We're sitting here with about 300 calls, and there's no way we can get to all of them,'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. Hotels in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> offered discount rates for people who only wanted to take showers. Taps also ran dry in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` There's got to be thousands of broken lines out there,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinard </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s public works department, which supplies water to 400,000 people. And in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Fire Chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said: `` We've got water mains and pipes bursting all over the city, everything from hotels to businesses to homes. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, water pressure dropped to dangerous levels and the <ORGANIZATION> Sewerage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issued urgent pleas for homeowners to find broken pipes and turn off the water. Firefighters battling a major fire Monday were hindered by the low water pressure, <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON> said. The cold caused substantial damage to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s $ 3.5 billion citrus crop and hurt other important winter crops, agriculture officials said Tuesday. Although <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials had n't released citrus loss figures, the freeze damage was likely to be substantial since much of the crop was still on the trees when freezing temperatures began Saturday. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state officials estimated 70 percent of their citrus crop and 80 percent of the winter vegetable crop were destroyed. Losses were estimated at $ 200 million. But some <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials and growers predicted they would be higher because warming temperatures ruined any hopes of salvaging the frozen fruit for juice. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, power had been restored Tuesday morning to nearly knocked by Sunday's blizzard, officials said. Of the 500 <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hatteras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Membership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> customers who had been without power Monday night, only the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> station at <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> remained in the dark, said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a staff assistant for the cooperative. <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, which had reported 5,000 people without electricity at the height of the storm, had `` zero customers out'' Wednesday, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>, the shy, Irish-born author whose despairing vision of the world in `` Waiting For Godot'' symbolized the pessimistic strain in modern writing, has died in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, his adopted home. He was 83. The poet, playwright and novelist died Friday but the death was not announced until after a small, private funeral service Tuesday. His publisher, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Linden </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> died of respiratory failure. The model of an artist who makes no compromise for the sake of popularity, the Nobel Prize-winning writer attributed his success to `` an intuitive sense of despair.'' `` There are no landmarks in my work,'' <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> once said. `` We are all adrift. We must invent a world in which to survive, but even this invented world is pervaded by fear and guilt. Our existence is hopeless.'' After the announcement of his death, several mourners gathered amid the neo-Gothic mausoleums of <ORGANIZATION> Montparnasse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> to place flowers on his simple granite marker. `` I admired him very much,'' said a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> philosophy student who lit a candle at the graveside but refused to give his name. `` I've read most of his works and found them very moving. I can not believe he's dead.'' At first, <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s audience was limited to an intellectual elite. But the reclusive writer and his plays, especially `` Waiting for Godot,'' came to be emblematic of a difficult modern style of literature even for people who never read or saw the works. `` He was in the forefront of modern literature,'' British playwright <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinter </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` He was totally original and a man of great courage, not only in himself, but in his work. His work knew no bounds.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s culture minister, called <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> `` an immense writer, exceptionally exacting, who has profoundly marked his century.'' <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> since 1937, working with the Resistance in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> during World War II, for which he won the Croix de Guerre with a gold star in 1945. He once said he preferred `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in war to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in peace.'' He wrote some of his some works in French and some in English, translating them himself into the other language. <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s last published work was an 1,801-word novella in March called `` Stirrings Still,'' a meditation on old age. Only 200 copies were published and sold for $ 1,720 each. <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s world echoed with cries of agony and compassion at the futility and loneliness of human existence, peopled with vagabond couples caught in a never-ending master-slave dialogue. Critic <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> once called <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> `` one of those artists for whom the miseries of the world are misery.'' The miseries first caught an audience's eye in 1952, when <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Blin </PERSON> rescued from obscurity <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s two-act fable about two tramps waiting for a third, Godot. Their grim jokes are interrupted by a brutal fat man driving a slave with a heavy burden. The fat man later returns blinded and moves on. The tramps end the play still waiting for Godot. The play was translated and performed in more than 20 languages. When it was staged last year at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Lincoln Center with <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> as the two tramps, it sold out. The stunning triumph of the 1952 production focused attention on <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s earlier works, with their recurring theme of the despairing vagabond. Later plays developed <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s themes of man's losing battle against destiny. In `` Endgame,'' a blind paralytic laments his fate while his senile and crippled parents die of despair in garbage cans. In `` Krapp's Last Tape,'' first performed in 1969, a nearly blind old man plays back a 30-year-old tape of his own voice and realizes he no longer understands the words he used in his youth. Beyond hope or ambition, he remains interested only in trivial reminders of his sex life and other bodily functions. <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1969. Always secretive about his personal life, he refused to attend the award ceremonies in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, fleeing to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> to avoid attention. Even the date of <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s birth was wrapped in mystery. He said he was born in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> on Good Friday, April 13, 1906. But his biographer, <PERSON> Deirdre </PERSON> <PERSON> Bair </PERSON>, suggested he was really born a month earlier, with <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> shifting it to the anniversary of the crucifixion as a boost to his self-made legend. The son of a surveyor, <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> was brought up in a comfortable, upper-middle class Protestant household. He studied modern languages at <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, and first came to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1928 to lecture in English at the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superieure </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> he met another Irish exile, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> had a moral effect on me,'' <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> said later. `` He made me realize the meaning of artistic integrity.'' After <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>, died in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> in 1933, his mother urged <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> to drop literature and take up a serious profession. To escape her and her family, <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> settled permanently in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1937. In 1938, <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> was stabbed in a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> street brawl. A woman passing by on her bicycle stopped to help the gravely injured man and have him taken to a hospital. That woman, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Deschevaux-Dumesnil </PERSON>, became his lifelong companion and they finally married in 1961. She died in July. The couple had no children.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration today announced an emergency $ 500,000 package of humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, after recognizing its provisional government. At the same time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> voiced regret that the trial of executed dictator <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, was conducted in secret. `` We would have preferred it if there had been a public trial,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said the $ 500,000 in aid would be made available by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. He said further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid also was likely. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has been devastated by bitter street battles between the army and security forces loyal to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. A hot line is being set up today at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to handle the many calls from Americans and Romanians wanting to donate food and medicine. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government today established diplomatic relations with the new legitimate government of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>,'' said a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> is the name adopted by the reform-minded leadership, which assumed control of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was deposed last week. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government pledges its support to the new Romanian government as it struggles to achieve its announced democratic values,'' said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement. It was issued a short while after <ORGANIZATION> Bucharest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife were executed Monday after a secret trial that found them guilty of killing more than 60,000 Romanians and the stealing more than $ 1 billion from the country. `` We regret the trial did not take place in an open and public fashion. We urge an end to all violence and bloodshed in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement said. The statement said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was informed by National Security Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> of the executions when <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> went to the presidential retreat at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, to discuss the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The Romanian Embassy issued a statement saying it had notified the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of the executions and the charges against the deposed couple. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that unless informed otherwise by the new <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> government, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers the existing ambassador and his staff as official representatives. Diplomats at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> have already been in touch with the new government to arrange safe passage for 42 government personnel and their dependents who were evacuated Sunday to neighboring <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shub </PERSON>. He said the 31-car convoy of foreigners that drove to the Bulgarian border also carried 26 other Americans.

<HEAD>Months of Political Turmoil Releases Wave of Dark Humor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lights and decorations brighten the city on both sides of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall during the Christmas season, but dark humor holds sway in the streets of the still-divided city. For decades, jokes poking fun at the once-mighty Communist regime remained among family and friends in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, but biting humor surfaced openly this fall with the decline of the Communists and the secret police. Most of the jokes floating across the now-porous borders focus on ousted East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and the corrupt <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> he once headed, as well as the rotten economic situation he left behind. A favorite joke concerns the future of the East German flag with the familiar compass and sickle emblem embroidered on the orange-and-black national colors. An unadorned version serves as the West German flag. `` What is the new emblem for the flag?'' goes the question. `` A suitcase,'' is the answer _ a reference to the more than 320,000 East Germans who have left for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in search of a better life this year alone. Although <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who is reportedly seriously ill, was stripped of power on Oct. 18 and has been in seclusion ever since, variations of jokes about him are told over and over in bars, stores and taxis. `` Why has <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> checked into a hotel on the Hungarian border?'' asks one East German. `` Because all the best doctors pass by there,'' replies another. Other jokes concern the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has lost some 700,000 members since the political trouble began earlier this year. `` What does a party member who finds one new party member get?'' went a joke that circulated during a recent party congress that swept away remnants of the old guard. `` He gets to leave the party.'' `` What does a party member who enrolls 10 new members get?'' the joke continues. `` A certificate that he was never a party member,'' goes the reply. A few of the jokes are simply unquotable. `` I know a lot of jokes, But you could never print them and this is n't the right place to tell them,'' said an East German border guard at the famous Checkpoint Charlie crossing point. Not all of the humor is aimed at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, a target of sometimes vicious jokes in his homeland, has found similar treatment in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Some East Germans have welcomed the West German leader. `` <PERSON> Lieber </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> als Sauerkraut,'' or `` Better <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> than Sauerkraut,'' read one banner displayed in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> during <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s trip there earlier this week. The word <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> means cabbage in German.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLucas </PERSON>, a senior lawyer at the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, was named today as the new head of enforcement of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, in his first major decision since taking over as head of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in October, made the announcement of <PERSON> McLucas </PERSON>' appointment at a news conference. The nomination of an enforcement director does not require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation, but it is considered the second-most powerful position at the agency because it is the enforcement division which has the job of policing the multibillion-dollar securities industry. <PERSON> McLucas </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> enforcement lawyer, had been considered a top contender to get the nod to succeed <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who announced he was stepping down last May after serving for four years as the head of enforcement. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> received widespread praise for the job he did in breaking open a series of big insider trading cases, beginning with the exposure of stockbroker <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, continuing through a $ 100 million settlement with speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and culminating with the settlement of a massive civil fraud case with junk bond-giant <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> took over the enforcement division at a time of turmoil for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> after his predecessor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON>, stepped down amid allegations that he beat his wife <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> was credited with restoring morale at the agency and spearheading a series of major investigations.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration announced its intention today to seize millions of dollars in assets that deposed dictator <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> allegedly shipped out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, while it continued diplomatic efforts to bring him to trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug charges. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the assets are all liquid and are primarily in bank accounts in half a dozen countries, many of them in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They amount to `` in excess of $ 10 million,'' he said. He refused to name the countries where <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> placed his money, which the spokesman referred to as `` illegal drug money.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> touched off a behind-the-scenes diplomatic struggle on Sunday when he presented himself at the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and asked for asylum. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops have surrounded the facility. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remained at his Camp David retreat, while an aide said he was monitoring the situation closely. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent roughly 14,000 troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> a week ago in an effort to restore democracy there and apprehend <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters today the administration has told the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> `` very directly'' of its desire to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stand trial. At the same time, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to rule out the possibility that some other option might be under consideration in the international negotiations that began over the weekend when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> turned up at the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> requesting asylum. Sources have said the discussions have included sending <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to a third country. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has `` 10 associate thugs'' in the Papal Nunciature with him. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said he did not know their names. `` Our position is we mean to bring him back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said this was the primary goal, although he would not rule out the possiblity that some other option might be under consideration. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has ruled out simply turning <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to a spokesman who noted that the Holy See does not have an extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops would continue to ring the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> `` as long as he's there. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not directly communicated with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on the subject, or with other <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials, `` we told them very directly what our feelings were,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The spokesman said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had offered <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, wanted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, a deal as recently as October in exchange for his stepping down from power voluntarily. But he did not accept it and now such deals are off, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said today that when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> turned himself in at the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> he was `` said to be so exhausted from the chase that he could barely speak.'' He said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been on the run since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations began on Tuesday and that he was never in command of the Panamanian Defense Forces resisting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> was now open 24 hours and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s two major airports, <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tocumen </LOCATION>, are open during limited hours. `` It's much quieter in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> than it has been since the operation began,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. He said some U. S. troops remained in city streets and others were moving west `` to check the countryside.'' He said they were meeting very little resistance, with citizens turning in their weapons to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers. The spokesman said about 33,000 weapons have been captured, discovered or turned in, including 6,000 under a program which offers rewards to former PDF members who give up their arms. Earlier, an administration source said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was talking in `` extraordinarily tough terms'' in its bid to convince the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to turn over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, just back from a Christmas Day visit with the 26,000 troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said today he hoped a quieting situation will allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to speed up the withdrawal of some American forces. But in an interview with ABC News he did not provide a timetable for troop movements. Papal representatives have contacted several Latin American and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries in hopes one will agree to accept <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. He described the situation as `` a Mexican standoff.'' `` He has no place to go yet,'' the official said. `` Nobody wants him.'' The White House disputed an account in today's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had talked by telephone Monday with the papal nuncio in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, Monsignor <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Laboa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> engaged in no such conversation. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> also said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> indicated it would be willing to give political asylum to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> were mentioned in the past as possible exile sites when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s representatives were negotiating with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1988 and again this year about the possibility of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> stepping down. But <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> might not be acceptable to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> because it has an extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> might not be palatable to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because that country would reject any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to be turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> custody. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said most of the discussions have been carried out between the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and church officials at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>.

 A band of motorists plunged across a busy stretch of freeway on Christmas Day to save a woman in a stalled car who was the target of a sexual assault, police said Tuesday. The passers-by thwarted a rape and risked their lives by running across Interstate 5, known as the Golden State Freeway, to help the woman, police said. `` It makes you feel good when you stop and realize there are good people out there. It's something to risk running across the I-5 freeway, which had pretty heavy traffic at that time,'' Police Officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clarita </LOCATION>, was booked for investigation of attempted rape, Detective <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazner </PERSON> said. Bail was set at $ 12,500 pending arraignment Wednesday. The woman and her infant were alone in her northbound car when it broke down near the junction of the interstate and the <LOCATION> Antelope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION>, about 25 miles north of downtown in the <LOCATION> Sylmar </LOCATION> area. The woman telephoned her boyfriend for help and was awaiting his arrival when a car with four men inside stopped. One of them forced his way inside, <PERSON> Brazner </PERSON> said. `` As her boyfriend pulled up, he witnessed her struggling with the man,'' the detective said. Several motorists traveling in the southbound freeway lanes at the same time also witnessed the commotion, he said. The motorists stopped and ran across the freeway to help capture <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who fled into nearby bushes along with the three other men, authorities said. The 21-year-old woman, a resident of the Canyon Country area of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clarita </LOCATION>, was sexually assaulted, but the motorists' intervention prevented a rape, the officials said She was treated for minor bruises at <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>.

 Musician <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> is taking the bitter with the sweet. His recent album `` Freedom'' has been critically acclaimed but is n't getting much radio play time to display its creative wares. `` Freedom'' recently hit a modest No. 35 on the Billboard charts, even though music critics have praised it lavishly. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> says he fails to get radio play time because he has dared to be experimental with his work during the past decade, and because he often gets boxed in as a `` classic rock'' artist on tightly formatted radio stations. `` If something does n't fit a station's image or sound, then it does n't get played,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` And there are certain stations that wo n't play me regardless of what the record is like. They do n't want to play music that their parents listened to because it does n't fit their image.'' Pop music critics have hailed `` Freedom'' as the most accessible and interesting work Young has done since such hit records as 1970's `` After the Gold Rush'' and 1972's `` Harvest.''

 <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> took his first name from an old newspaper, his last from some writing he spotted on the wall of a soup kitchen. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> ca n't recall his real name or where he came from. Indeed he ca n't remember anything from before January 1988. He said that's when he woke up in a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> bus station, his mind a total blank. `` I feel like a lunatic sometimes because I do n't know who I am. I have no identity. The only thing I know is how to live on the street,'' said <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, who appears to be in his 20s. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Grislis </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, tested <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> and concluded he has at least a high school education. But <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said he was unfamiliar with World War I and Watergate. He knows the Beatles were a rock group because he read about them in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, but does n't know their songs. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> lived on the streets of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, afraid to seek help because he thought they would `` lock me up in a mental hospital and I would n't get out.'' He was befriended by a <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, construction worker who spotted him near <LOCATION> Fenway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in August 1988. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Guisti </PERSON>, 54, visited <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> weekly and sometimes gave him money for food. `` He did n't look human,'' <PERSON> Guisti </PERSON> said of his friend with deep-green eyes and a scraggly brown beard. `` He was a person in need.'' After months of urging, <PERSON> Guisti </PERSON> persuaded <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> to go to the homeless shelter in <LOCATION> Woonsocket </LOCATION>, about five miles from <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>, and get help. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> arrived Oct. 24 and can stay six months. Shelter officials and <LOCATION> Woonsocket </LOCATION> police take <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>'s claim of amnesia seriously. `` I have n't found anything to indicate that he might be feigning,'' said shelter director <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempster </PERSON>. `` It's genuine.'' He said <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> does not smoke, drink or use drugs. <LOCATION> Woonsocket </LOCATION> police sent <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>'s fingerprints to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, which determined he has no criminal or military record. The police also distributed <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>'s description _ 5 feet 7, 145 pounds _ to police departments nationwide. So far, the police have turned up nothing. `` If it turns out that this individual does n't have much in way of family, then we might run into a roadblock,'' said Detective Lt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. `` If nobody's filed a missing person report, there's nothing we can do about it.'' <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> has undergone psychological counseling at the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crino </PERSON>, a registered psychiatric nurse, said it is impossible to diagnose <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>'s problem until he takes some more medical tests. He said several illnesses, including a brain tumor, epilepsy and alcoholism, can produce memory loss. To rule out an organic cause, officials at the health center ordered a brain scan, physical examination, blood tests and a test that checks the brain's electrical potential. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> has taken the first two, but refuses to take the others. He said the brain scan made his eyes sensitive to light and irritated his sinuses. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said he struggles to regain his memory. `` I'd look at people and try to picture what my relatives must look like,'' he said. `` But there's nothing for me to remember.'' <PERSON> Dempster </PERSON> said he would like <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> to get a driver's license and Social Security card in his adopted name soon, `` so he can start living a normal lifestyle.'' For his part, <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said, `` The only thing I can think of is if the police find my identity, or my memory comes back. That's the only hope I have.''

<HEAD>China Claims Mao Revival As Chairman's 96th Birthday Marked</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> marked the 96th birthday of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> on Tuesday amid official claims that young people disillusioned with Western philosophies are rediscovering truth in the works of the late Great Helmsman. The official press says there is a quiet resurgence of interest in <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, the father of Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> who, since his death in 1976, has also been blamed for bringing great suffering to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with his radical policies. Young people, the media report, have abandoned their <PERSON> Sartre </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nietzsche </PERSON> and have returned to the works of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. College students, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON> <PERSON> Daily </PERSON> said, after traveling the `` winding road'' of fascination with Western thought, `` have returned to our forefathers to ask for advice. ... Is this not a good omen?'' The implication is that college students, after the government's bloody suppression of their pro-democracy movement this year and months of heavy political indoctrination, now realize that <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> were right all along Young people questioned privately said they had heard of no one rushing out to buy `` The Selected Works of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>.'' `` <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> is a kind of cover,'' said one graduate student. `` Journalists have to perform their job, they have to write something'' and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> is a safe subject that adheres to party line, he said. Crowds at <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s mausoleum in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where his body lies in state, were far smaller on his birthday Tuesday than in previous years. A bitingly cold Siberian wind may have kept many away, as did the continuation of martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that limits access to the square to those with proper IDs. One vender outside the mausoleum said 10,000 to 20,000 people a day viewed <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s body before June. Now, the number is 4,000 to 5,000 daily. The overseas edition of the official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday reported the increased popularity of <LOCATION> Shaoshan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s birthplace in rural southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It said <PERSON> Shaoshan </PERSON> will receive 600,000 visitors this year, up from last year but still far below the nearly 3 million pilgrims a year during <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s lifetime. The daily also said <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s 96th birthday was being marked with the release of a tape titled `` A Truly Great Man of No Equal In His Time'' on which 12 of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s poems are set to traditional music. A book chronicling <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s family line back to the Yuan Dynasty -LRB- 1271-1368 -RRB- was also published. However, a check of several bookstores found neither tape nor works by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>. A clerk at one of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s larger bookshops said <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s works had been sold out since June, but a saleswoman at a smaller shop said, `` we have n't carried <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s works for five years.'' Another clerk corrected her, saying, `` we have n't carried them for 20 years. Every family already has his works, so there's no need to buy them.'' During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s disastrous attempt to purge the bureaucracy and restore ideological purity to the revolution, all Chinese were required to possess his `` Little Red Book'' of quotations and study from it daily. Official reports of a revival of interest in Mao have also been tempered by warnings against nostalgia for the personality cult around <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> that his successor, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, has tried to eschew. `` Everyone knows that <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> was a man and not a god,'' the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily said. It quoted <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> was a great man and `` if it were not for Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> our country would have groped in the dark for an even longer period of time.'' But it cautioned against `` great mass fervor among young students'' for the Great Helmsman. There is little sign of that, although some Chinese embittered by the government's corruption and harsh suppression of democratic reform look back fondly on the revolutionary ideals represented by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> in the early days of the People's Republic. `` People prefer <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> to now,'' said the graduate student. `` The present government is too corrupt. At least <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> was for the people.''

 Retired policeman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> doted on his ailing wife for years. But, faced with heart surgery and worried that he could no longer care for her, he shot and killed her on Christmas Eve, police say. Both authorities and neighbors say <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had begged him to end her suffering, but he still faces first-degree murder charges. `` He was a very loving, caring man,'' said neighbor <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitzmiller </PERSON>. `` He took care of her from morning until night, around the clock.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 67, appeared briefly in court Tuesday, accused of shooting his wife of 44 years in the head with a .38 - caliber revolver while she sat in a wheelchair in the dining room of their brick <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> declined to comment to reporters after his appearance before Criminal Court Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON>. The judge scheduled another appearance for Jan. 12, and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> remained free on a personal recognizance bond. Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 64, had suffered for 20 years from multiple sclerosis, a degenerative disease of the nervous system, and also had heart and kidney problems, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. After the shooting, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> telephoned police to turn himself in and waited for them at home, the officer said. He was released into his daughter's custody after a Christmas Day court hearing. `` His health was n't the best and hers was deteriorating,'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had learned that a heart problem for which he had to undergo surgery two years ago had recurred. `` He said he would be unable to take care of his wife and himself,'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told police that `` all his wife did was complain about how much she was suffering and she begged him to end it.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' daughter told police she had spoken to her father earlier Sunday and that he told her his doctor had advised him that he required a second major heart operation and he would n't be able to care for his wife, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. `` I know <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> was taking her to the doctors quite frequently,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Kitzmiller </PERSON>. `` She was totally confined to a wheelchair, and she had taken a turn for the worse in the last six months.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> joined the force in 1957 and retired in 1985, said Officer <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Camden </PERSON>. During his 28-year career, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was awarded 30 honorable mentions, one department commendation and five complimentary letters, `` about average for an aggressive policeman,'' <PERSON> Camden </PERSON> said. Calls to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' home went unanswered Tuesday and his attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, did not return several telephone messages. `` He was a very nice man,'' said <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciezczak </PERSON>, another neighbor. `` He seemed to always help his wife. ... He cared for her very much.'' <PERSON> Ciezczak </PERSON>, who lives across the street from the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> home, said he did not hear the shooting Sunday. `` We ... saw all the squad cars and the ambulance and the fire department,'' he said. `` The first thing that came to my mind was that she had died, like on her own, because everybody knew that she was in very bad health.'' Said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearnes </PERSON>, another neighbor: `` To take a life that way, I could n't visualize <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> doing that.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> repeatedly refused to explain his own work, leaving it to critics and audiences to interpret, puzzle over and argue about the writings of one of the 20th century's greatest playwrights `` I meant what I said,'' was all he would ever offer about a body of work that encompassed the darkest of despair about the human condition in scores of plays, novels and poems that defied convention. He did n't write plots. He did n't construct plays with stories to tell. His masterpiece was `` Waiting for Godot,'' the tale of two tramp-like figures, Estragon and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON>, waiting for the mysterious Godot, who never arrives. It had no beginning and no end. Futility and funny business exist side by side. When asked for a summary of the play, the great clown <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahr </PERSON>, who played Estragon on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>, said simply, `` It's about two bums.'' The play's history in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> mirrors <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s gradual acceptance by American critics and audiences In early 1956, it had a disastrous tryout in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> where two-thirds of the opening-night audience walked out after the first act. `` Playing ` Waiting for Godot' in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was like doing ` Giselle' at <LOCATION> Roseland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lahr </PERSON> said later. Partially recast and with a new director, the play opened on Broadway to widely divergent reaction. Columnist <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON> vilified it. Audiences were mystified, and so were many of the reviewers. Critic <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON> called it `` a mystery wrapped in an enigma,'' adding that `` Theatergoers can rail at it, but they can not ignore it.'' But `` Waiting for Godot'' folded after a run of only 59 performances. `` It has taken the world a little while to catch up with <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, who was in the original Broadway production of `` Godot.'' `` The source of his greatness is that he tapped into the universal unconscious of Western society in the 20th century. He expressed something so deeply felt by people who were shook up by war, destruction and technology. He was not really a writer, he was a visionary.'' Thirty-two years later, there were no quibbles about `` Waiting for Godot'' when <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> directed an all-star version starring <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Lincoln Center. Whatever their thoughts about the particular production, critics and audiences embraced the play as a modern masterpiece. <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s influence on other playwrights was enormous. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Albee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinter </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON> and particularly <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoppard </PERSON>, in his `` <PERSON> Rosencrantz </PERSON> and Guildenstern are Dead,'' acknowledged <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s hold over them in his use of language, time and images. <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s plays are filled with indelible images, most of them of people trapped, unable to move or even sometimes to speak. In `` Endgame,'' one character can not sit, another can not stand, while two more are encased in trashcans. In `` Rockaby,'' an old woman, rocking slowly in a chair, confronts death. In `` Play,'' three voices are imprisoned in large earthen jars. In `` Happy Days,'' a woman is buried up to her neck in sand. As he grew older, his plays became more minimalistic _ and more nihilistic. In `` Acts Without Words,'' he wrote a play with no dialogue, only sounds. In `` Not I,'' a one-character play he wrote for actress <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitelaw </PERSON>, only the outline of the draped performer is visible with a spotlight focused on her mouth. `` He was to playwriting what <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> was to physics in the 20th century,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON>, artistic director of the Lincoln Center Theater. `` After he figured out what he did, which seems so simple and obvious because it was so true, nothing ever was the same afterwards. It's the idea that all that's left to us is trying to live a decent life in a world that has gone completely nuts. Take <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s great joke: ` 90 percent of life is just showing up.' That's a line straight out of <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>.''

 Israeli warplanes destroyed a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> command post south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Tuesday, hours after paratroopers backed by tanks and air cover wiped out another <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> base in southeastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police said nine people were killed and 26 wounded in the two attacks. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> army defused a car rigged with 165 pounds of explosives near Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' office 30 minutes before it was set to go off, police said. `` A bloodbath has been averted,'' said a police spokesman. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, was at home five blocks away when the bomb was discovered and did not appear to be the target, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Police said at least seven people were killed and 23 wounded in the five-minute air raid that wrecked the two-story <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in the coastal town of <LOCATION> Rmeile </LOCATION>, 20 miles south of the capital. The building took at least two direct rocket hits as six Phantom F-4 fighter-bombers attacked it. Rescuers searched the wreckage for more victims late Tuesday. Reporters heard moans and screams from beneath the debris. Among those killed was Communist commander codenamed <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabei </PERSON>, who just before his death screamed for his 22-year-old daughter, still buried in the ruins. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the Israeli military command said its warplanes returned to their bases. It said the Communists had organized and launched attacks on Israeli forces and the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, an Israeli-backed Lebanese militia. Police said two other Communist guerrillas were killed and three wounded as Israeli paratroopers earlier destroyed the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Nabi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Safi </LOCATION>, in the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> 7 -LCB- miles north of the zone <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupies in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The two-hour assault was the Israeli army's heaviest ground operation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since an assault against the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> Dec. 9, 1988. The attack force of 100 commandos advanced from the border enclave, occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since 1982, in four tanks and eight armored personnel carriers behind a massive artillery barrage, police reported. The attackers stormed through the villages of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meshki </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebbaya </LOCATION> in the eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> after two helicopter gunships blasted the villages with eight rockets, destroying many houses, the spokesman said. Forty other paratroopers were then dropped by helicopters in <LOCATION> Nabi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Safa </LOCATION>, where they blew up the Communists' two-story command post, the spokesman added. The Israeli military said their side suffered no casualties. But a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> statement in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> said `` the enemy suffered heavy losses in lives and ammunition at the hands of our heroes who fought hand-to-hand to repulse the attack.'' The villages have long been used by the Communists and other leftist Lebanese and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla factions allied with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to attack the Israeli-held zone.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> performed `` in a highly professional manner'' during Labor Day disturbances in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, according to findings of an independent review announced Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chief of the bureau, said the review was conducted by a team led by Brig. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> at the request of Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION> He said the reviewers found no evidence to support contentions that delays in deployment of the Guard on the morning of Sept. 3 contributed to the damage from looting and vandalism. The study showed that alert and call-up procedures `` worked remarkably well considering the number of troops mobilized and deployed, the short time period that elapsed between initial alert and actual deployment, and the fact that it took place in the middle of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s busiest summer holiday weekend.'' Temple said no instance of physical abuse by a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> member had been verified during the disturbances Sept. 1-5. He said several members of the Guard received minor injuries, but none required hospitalization.

<HEAD>Government of King Hussein Loosens Martial Law Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government of King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> on Tuesday removed most categories of crimes from the military courts, significantly easing <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s 22-year-old martial law. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said the cabinet, acting on the wishes of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, gave civil courts jurisdiction over cases ranging from political offenses to price hike violations and homicide. The action is the last in a series of liberalizing measures in the kingdom, which this year held its first general elections in more than two decades and reversed a controversial 1988 law that nationalized all daily newspapers. The changes were sparked by four days of rioting in April in which at least 10 people died following price hikes of many subsidized goods and services and the appearance of government indifference to the economic situation of many Jordanians. The cabinet said civil courts will immediately start handling cases involving firearms, gunplay at weddings, homicide, price gouging, forgery, assaults on officials, violations of martial law orders and the ban on membership in political parties, as well as the law against communism. Military courts have handled such cases since martial law was imposed during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, in which <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> lost the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> _ with much of its economy and population _ to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The cabinet also said that a ministerial committee will study whether to remove economic and security offenses from martial law jurisdiction, and will report its findings within two months. The action comes the same week that the newly appointed government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Mudar </PERSON> <PERSON> Badran </PERSON> must by law seek a vote of confidence from the recently elected parliament, most of whose members campaigned for an end to martial law. The king earlier this year promised to limit martial law.

 The freeze that struck <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus and vegetable crops should drive up food prices somewhat, but not very much, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expert said Tuesday. The expert, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said an earlier forecast that food prices generally may rise 3 percent to 5 percent next year is still valid. Overall food prices are up an average of about 5.7 percent this year, the largest annual gain since a 7.8 percent jump in 1981. Much of this year's increase was due to lingering effects of the 1988 drought and poor weather early in 1989. `` I'm not worried about my overall forecast -LRB- for 1990 -RRB- at this point,'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` But there'll be some impact, and possibly higher prices in the first quarter.'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said he and other agency analysts are `` still trying to assess the damage'' to citrus and vegetable crops in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` The main thing is oranges,'' he said. `` Vegetables _ tomatoes, bell peppers, celery _ they're some of the big volume things that would be coming out of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> now.'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said 90 percent of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> oranges are for processing and that a lot of them can be salvaged for juice. The main source of `` fresh market'' oranges is <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` There will be some -LRB- retail -RRB- price impact,'' he said. `` But since we do have decent supplies in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> this year ... the supply impact will be minimal.'' With the supply of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> orange juice reduced by the freezing weather, <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said imports from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> will probably rise sharply. `` We've got super supplies in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> this year, but the price has been fairly low because of the higher supplies,'' he said. `` But now that we probably will be importing, that will push the price up some.'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said he had not seen damage reports from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where state officials have estimated losses of 70 percent of the citrus and 80 percent of the winter vegetables. Vegetable losses are `` a more temporary kind of thing'' because those crops can be replanted, he said. Growers were just starting to harvest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s main supply of winter vegetables when the cold weather struck. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is still producing vegetables, however, and `` this time of year we start getting produce out of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, too,'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said. `` There's no doubt that some of the supplies will be cut short, and we'll probably see higher prices'' at produce counters, he said.

<TEXT>
 The government of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> suffered an economic setback Tuesday when the Argentine currency lost 27 percent of its value against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar in a single day. At the close of the business day, foreign exchange houses offered 1,700 australs for each dollar. Last Friday, the market rate was 1,230 australs per dollar. Banks were closed Monday for Christmas. After weeks of pressure against the austral, the government Dec. 10 formally devalued the currency by 34 percent, bringing the official and free market rates briefly in parity. However, the austral plunge anew after interest rates soared as did prices and wage demands by workers. On Dec. 15, Economy Minister <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> resigned, and his successor, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, three days later freed the exchange rate and lifted most price controls. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has struggled with the economy ever since taking office July 8. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> is <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s third economy minister, and <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON> is the third <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> president.

 Ambassador <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoichici </PERSON> and a few aides struggled to conduct diplomacy from the barricaded, egg-splattered <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday, consulting with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and helping Romanians who want to return home. The embassy was closed while the staff shifted gears and loyalties from the deposed <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> to the revolutionary <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which televised pictures of the executed despot and his wife Tuesday morning. `` We have the same feelings as other Romanians,'' said <PERSON> Stoichici </PERSON>, who declared his loyalty to the new government on Saturday, before the outcome of the fighting was clear. Another embassy officer, <PERSON> Vasile </PERSON> <PERSON> Leca </PERSON>, said `` all the staff ... fully support the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. We condemn the crimes that were done to the Romanian people by <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Stoichici </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Leca </ORGANIZATION> refused to allow a reporter inside the embassy, speaking instead through iron bars on a window in the consular section. Splattered, frozen eggs coated the white brick walls of the embassy, a turn-of-century mansion on <LOCATION> Sheridan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> along Embassy Row. Wooden police barricades and yellow plastic tape stretched alongside the sidewalk where scores of Romanians braved frigid temperatures over Christmas weekend to vent their rage against a symbol of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s 24-year rule. The ambassador said his first order of business was to `` work to improve relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' which had grown increasingly critical of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s human rights policies. `` Last evening, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> informed us that they recognized the staff of the Romanian Embassy'' as the representative of the new government, said the ambassador. He said he was in telephone contact with <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said no meetings were scheduled between <LOCATION> Stoichici </LOCATION> and American diplomats, `` but we remain in contact with them as much as we can.'' `` They are in telephone contact with us, but when we call them, they do n't answer,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Press calls to the embassy were not answered, either. Romanian consular officials were also accepting, through the barred window, visa applications from Romanian-Americans who wanted to return home. `` I want to go back to help the people who are suffering. I would like to offer blood, money, anything I can,'' said Ilie Aurelian, a Romanian emigre artist who lives in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. His wife is part of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s Hungarian minority and subject to official persecution under <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> They emigrated from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> five years ago. <PERSON> Ioan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buburuzan </PERSON>, 38, a taxi driver and artist from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was also at the embassy seeking a visa to visit his father in the village of <LOCATION> Turdaa </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Klug </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. He emigrated eight years ago. <PERSON> Buburuzan </PERSON> said his only regret is that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife had been executed so quickly. `` I wish they had put him on trial. That would have given the people a chance to see his crimes. And some of the evidence might have been embarassing to people who are still in power now,'' said <PERSON> Buburuzan </PERSON>. Aurelian disagreed, saying it was necessary to kill <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> to prevent security forces from rescuing him and restoring him to power. `` So now the killing has stopped. That is good,'' said Aurelian. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials also regretted the secret trial. `` We would have preferred it if there had been a public trial,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan groups have kicked off a campaign to rid <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> streets of crack cocaine dealers _ a move that the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> and police view with suspicion. A `` <PERSON> Krush </PERSON> <PERSON> Krack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocaine </PERSON>'' initiative calls on <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> members to act as eyes and ears for police, gathering the goods on drug dealers and forwarding the information to law-enforcement authorities, group leaders say. `` We're not requesting that our people become vigilantes,'' said <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, grand wizard of the national Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark </LOCATION>. But two recent incidents involving leaders of separate Klan groups have caught the attention of police and the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>, the 44-year-old state kleagle of the Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, was questioned by police last month after he tried to make a citizen's arrest of a uspected prostitute and drove her to the police station. The woman, who was black, told police <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> identified himself as a police officer and told her she was under arrest. The woman did not want to press charges and police released <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>. On Dec. 13, undercover detectives stopped <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON> of <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON>, the 40-year-old grand dragon of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, on suspicion of impersonating a police officer. Authorities decided not to accuse him of the third-degree felony because he did not try to assert authority. The two Klan groups, which are not affiliated, are both focusing on the north side of <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>, which is preodminantly black and which city officials say is the area suffering most from drug and violent crime problems. <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON>, in a recent interview, said his followers began citizen patrols about eight months ago, splitting up in teams of five to cruise crime-ridden areas. `` We have come into contact with several drug dealers and have dealt with them accordingly. We talked to them and prayed with them a little bit, and they moved to <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said of drug dealers: `` We can get the addresses and send them in and let the law take care of it.'' `` We would look at the Klan as we would any informant,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nenner </PERSON>. But he warned that any law violations would be vigorously pursued. Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> declined to confirm whether the Klan had offered its information-gathering services, saying it would be unfair to all informants if he revealed their identities. `` I see no problem with them as long as they conduct themselves appropriately. We do n't promote anyone taking the law into their own hands,'' he said. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of the Lakeland chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, said his group often offers tips to law enforcement authorities. He welcomed the Klan's participation unless they are targeting certain ethnic grups. `` If the Klan is sincere in their endeavor and their efforts are to expose the drug dealers whether black, white or Hispanic, I commend them,'' he said. `` But if they are doing this to target certain ethnic groups, I think it is appalling and they should be punished without mercy and with passion.'' In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, a Klan group tried to join the state's `` Adopt-A-Highway'' program, an anti-litter campaign which credits volunteers who spruce up a section of highway by erecting a sign bearing their names In October, state <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> denied the group's request.

 A Panamanian officer considered one of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s `` right-hand men'' and accused of helping the deposed dictator smuggle cocaine for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel pleaded innocent before a federal judge Tuesday. `` I surrendered myself _ I wanted to be brought here,'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON>, 46, faces racketeering, drug-smuggling and money-laundering charges in the same February 1988 indictment that accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel figures of importing cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The commander of a <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> unit in the northern <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Chiriqui </LOCATION>, del Cid surrendered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces Saturday after last week's invasion and was brought to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Monday. He is the first key <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> aide named in the case to be brought into court. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> was `` a liason, courier and emissary for <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, dealing with drug trafficking,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. `` We allege he personally imported shipments of cocaine, and he personally transmitted large amounts of cash.'' <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> called del Cid `` one of the right-hand men of Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' Wearing faded jeans and a blue polo shirt, del Cid strongly denied the four counts in court and demanded a jury trial. <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> appointed a public defender as del Cid's temporary counsel after the Panamanian testified he carried only $ 7,000 in cash with him and had no access to a frozen savings account in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The judge turned back efforts by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office to ask detailed questions of del Cid in an effort to uncover any additional assets, saying such testimony could affect the racketeering counts against him. Outside the courtroom, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said federal investigators are convinced the conspirators are sitting on large amounts of cash. `` They were dealing with large amounts of drugs _ that makes a potential for a lot of profit,'' <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. `` We've always believed they made a lot of money.'' One of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s criminal attorneys, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON>, appeared at the hearing. He said he did not expect to represent del Cid but wanted to monitor the case. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> asked the judge to bar any consultations between del Cid and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s attorney, saying the defendant might not understand that <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> might not have <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON>'s best interests in mind, but <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> refused. Asked if his real concern was that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might try to pressure his former aide, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said only, `` I'd rather go with my explanation.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney referred any questions about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> refused to say what contacts his office had made with del Cid, or if he had indicated a willingness to testify against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> faces a maximum of 70 years in prison and fines of $ 550,000. He was ordered held without bond at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> until a full hearing Jan. 2. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment accuses <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, del Cid, cartel leader <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> and 12 others of running drugs and using <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as a safe haven. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, using del Cid as an emissary, allegedly allowed the cartel to process drugs, launder money and ship cocaine through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, accepting a $ 4.6 million bribe from the Colombians. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> is accused of having a personal role in a 400-kilogram cocaine shipment to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in December 1982. He also allegedly picked up $ 100,000 from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s personal pilot, <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacerez </PERSON>, in November 1982, and delivered $ 200,000 to <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> at the military headquarters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> a month later. <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> is one of the principal witnesses in the case. Two minor defendants, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Alden </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidow </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Saldarriaga </PERSON>, were to go on trial here Jan. 8, but <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> indicated Tuesday he expects to ask for a delay in that case. It will not take long to begin any prosecution of del Cid, however, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney said. `` We are confident that we have the evidence to convict him,'' <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. `` We're ready to try him.'' A separate federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and others on charges of taking a $ 5.4 million bribe from the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. But the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he would be tried first in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> because the prosecution case there is stronger. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> was not named in the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> indictment.

 <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> on Tuesday selected agency veteran <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLucas </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s new head of enforcement and announced creation of a new fraud unit covering the sale of securities by financial institutions. <PERSON> McLucas </PERSON>, 39, will succeed <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who resigned as <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> director of enforcement in July after heading some of the agency's biggest insider trading investigations The enforcement job, which does not require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation, is considered the second most powerful position at the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and it is <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>'s first major appointment since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tapped him as chairman last summer. <PERSON> McLucas </PERSON>, who has worked in the enforcement division for the past 12 years, had been considered one of the front-runners for the post, but <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said he had considered three other <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> attorneys and several persons from outside the agency before making the final selection. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> had decided to create a 25-attorney special unit to investigate overly aggressive sales of securities by savings and loans and other financial institutions. Such sales have been a major focus of congressional hearings into the activities at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Calif.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L whose failure is expected to be the biggest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, costing taxpayers as much as $ 2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>' parent company is <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. When American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws, it left shareholders and investors holding nearly worthless stocks and bonds. Included in this group were some 22,000 small investors who purchased nearly $ 200 million in corporate bonds at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION>'s 29 Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> branches. About two-thirds of these investors were elderly depositors. At congressionaly hearings, some of these investors testified that they wrongly believed that the bonds they were purchasing were federally insured. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said that the new <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> unit would try to prevent other financially troubled S & amp; Ls from turning to fradulent practices in a desperate effort to raise cash. `` We intend to see to it that when people are sold securities, they are provided all the necessary information,'' <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who resigned to join a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm, received widespread praise for a series of big insider trading cases, beginning with the exposure of stockbroker <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> also spearheaded cases that resulted in a $ 100 million settlement with speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and a record $ 650 million settlement of a massive civil fraud cause with junk bond-giant <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In May 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filed charges against <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, whose cooperation led to <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who in turn implicated <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> in the largest securities fraud case ever brought by the government. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> took over the enforcement division in 1985 at a time of turmoil after his predecessor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON>, stepped down amid allegations that he beat his wife. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> was credited with restoring morale at the agency. The scandals in recent years have forced Wall Street's big brokerage houses to re-evaluate their compliance and ethics codes and led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to increase the penalties for insider trading. At the news conference, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has boosted the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> budget by almost 20 percent this year to $ 168 million, providing enough new money to hire an additional 100 lawyers. He said it was important for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to police the securities industry in such a way that individual investors will have renewed confidence. Individual investors have left the market in droves in recent years, partly out of fears raised by the huge gyrations in stock prices that occurred in October of 1987 and 1989. During the 1970s, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement division first gained attention under <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> for pursuing corporations that maintained political slush funds and paid bribes to win overseas business.

<HEAD>Mayor Regrets That Blacks Didn't See Him as Friend</HEAD>

 Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said Tuesday that his biggest regret in 12 years at City Hall is that he did not get credit for helping blacks. `` Many people in the black community do not perceive that I was their friend,'' he said in his annual year-end meeting with reporters, the last scheduled major press conference of his mayoralty. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who lost his re-election bid to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, who is black, claimed credit for appointing the city's first black police commissioner, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, and the first black deputy mayor for economic development, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON>. He said that under his administration, the percentage of civil service jobs held by members of minority groups grew from 31 percent to 62 percent. He said he created Operation Giant Step, a program to put 4-year-olds in kindergarten, that he said was helpful largely to black children. `` I believe this administration has been more helpful to the black minority than all administrations before us,'' he said. `` I do n't think we got credit for it.'' He discussed a remark that contributed to his political demise, his statement during the 1988 presidential campaign that Jews `` would be crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. That caused a black backlash that carried into this year's mayoral primary, when <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> took 97 percent of the black vote <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> maintained, however, that the black outpouring for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> was a matter of ethnic pride rather than an attack on him. He said the second half of his remark about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> went unheeded. It was, `` ... in the same way that blacks and supporters of black causes would be crazy to vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Asked how history would judge him in the light of dealing with new problems such as the drug abuse, AIDS and homelessness, he said, `` They know that within the confines of what a mayor can do, that I did a lot.'' After 25 years in city and federal government, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, 65, a former congressman and City Councilman, will be embarking on a new career as a newspaper columnist, radio and TV commentator, and university and guest lecturer.

 Drinks are on the house at Pasta Too restaurant. No, it's not the holiday spirit: The owners have been giving them away for more than 4 years because they ca n't afford a liquor license to sell alcohol. `` Hey, it's an extra little bennie -LRB- benefit -RRB- for the adults,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leddy </PERSON>, who recently frequented the restaurant in suburban <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> with his wife, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON>, and their daughter, <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON>. Pasta Too has been offering complimentary drinks to adults as `` a nice gesture'' for about 4 -LCB- years, owner <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Piacquadio </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Piacquadio </PERSON> said his business is too small to pay the $ 40,000 or more needed for a license to sell beer and wine. So for those who want it, he gives it away _ plastic cups of <LOCATION> Meisterbrau </LOCATION> draft and glasses of <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> chablis and burgundy. It's perfectly legal, according to <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandrovich </PERSON>, a supervisor in the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> office of the state police <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liquor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>. Nothing in the liquor code prohibits an unlicensed establishment from giving away free beer, wine or liquor to sober, orderly adults 21 and older. It is illegal, however, for a licensed business to give away liquor. No purchase is necessary at restaurants giving away free drinks, <PERSON> Sandrovich </PERSON> said. `` If you come in and say, ` I just want the free beer,' they have to give it to you,'' he said.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Questions Cancellation of Martin Autopsy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An autopsy on former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was canceled Tuesday at his family's request, and a prosecutor said that could make it harder to charge the driver of the truck in which <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> died. The <LOCATION> Broome </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department reported slow progress in investigating the Christmas night accident that killed <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 61, and injured a longtime friend, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, who was at the wheel of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s pickup. Sheriff <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffo </PERSON> said it would be another day or two before the alcohol level in <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>'s blood was confirmed through laboratory tests. <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> was charged Christmas night with a misdemeanor charge of driving-while-intoxicated and faces a fine of up to $ 1,000 and a year in jail. Authorities said the pickup skidded off an icy road Monday evening in front of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s 148-acre farm near <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, 150 miles northwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Neither man was wearing a seat belt, authorities said. <PERSON> Ruffo </PERSON> said the accident happened at a hairpin curve that has a history of accidents. Icy, slippery roads and <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>'s unfamiliarity with the area were believed to be factors in the accident, <PERSON> Ruffo </PERSON> said. He said the speed limit on the road was 55 mph, but did not know how fast the truck had been going. Mechanical failure of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s four-wheel-drive pickup was ruled out, the sheriff said. `` The truck checked out fine,'' he said. An autopsy scheduled Tuesday was canceled at the request of family members, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Doll </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Broome </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollen </PERSON> said he hoped to persuade County Coroner <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruddy </PERSON> to conduct an autopsy in spite of the family's wishes in order to pinpoint the exact cause of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s death. But <PERSON> Ruddy </PERSON> said an autopsy would reveal little that an external examination did not. `` He died, basically, of a fractured neck,'' <PERSON> Ruddy </PERSON> said. `` The chest X-ray was reasonably intact, belly was normal, blood count was normal. It's all in the neck area.'' <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>'s Bar near <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s Tiger Stadium, suffered a broken hip and possible broken ribs in the accident. He was listed in fair condition Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Upstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> had gone to a store and then stopped for a quick drink at a <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION> bar, said Deputy <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Glanville </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mollen </PERSON> said it would be `` days, at least'' before he decides whether to charge <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> with anything more serious than driving while intoxicated, such as manslaughter. The lack of an autopsy would not preclude further charges, <PERSON> Mollen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> purchased the farm in September 1988, three months after he was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON> for the final time. He said he was attracted to the area for its fishing and quiet surroundings. The feisty <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> made a good name for himself by narrating the <ORGANIZATION> Binghamton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>'s production of `` Billy the Kid'' and speaking at a local girls' softball league dinner, but he and his wife, <PERSON> Jill </PERSON>, were also in the news for confronting a group of children riding horses. Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and an unidentified man with a gun chased the youths off the land, saying they were destroying property and setting fires, and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> confronted the manager of the stable that organized the ride. The stable said it had negotiated an easement with the previous owner of the land. The Internal Revenue Service last summer placed a $ 35,562 tax lien on the property, reportedly to cover an alleged underpayment on <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s 1987 income tax return. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffino </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, said the lien had been paid recently. In addition to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s wife, survivors include one son and one daughter, both from previous marriages. Funeral services were not immediately announced.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, still struggling to get custody of deposed dictator <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said Tuesday it wants to freeze millions of dollars in assets he allegedly transferred out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials will file papers Wednesday in more than a half-dozen countries where, he said, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had hidden `` illegal drug money'' amounting to more than $ 10 million. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> would try to freeze cash, or liquid assets, which are in European bank accounts. He refused to identify the banks, although he did say that none of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s money has been traced to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The administration was training its legal sights on Panamanian money assets as officials remained embroiled in tense negotiations over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, wanted in this country on drug-trafficking charges. The administration sought to pry <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from the custody of the the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, conferred three time on the street outside the embassy with Monsignor <PERSON> Sabastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Laboa </PERSON>, the papal nuncio. Despite the negotiations, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the situation with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might be prolonged for an indefinite period of time. `` It could be that they'll have a long-term resident in their embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, which has no extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, refused to simply hand <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. And it has maintained that stand since the deposed <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader, along with what <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> described as `` 10 associate thugs,'' sought asylum at Papal Nunciature Sunday afternoon. `` Our position is, we mean to bring him back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But he refused to rule out the possibility that other options might be considered. One scenario is that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might stand trial in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Another had him possibly going to a third country. `` Everybody is talking to everybody,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But he said `` it's too soon to characterize it as progress.'' Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not talked directly either with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> or with the nunciature in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have used diplomatic channels to press their demand. `` We told them very directly what our feeling were,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> spoke at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was having a working lunch with top advisers at his Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and as the chief <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said conditions had stabilized in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was briefed by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, newly returned from a visit to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, along with national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> revealed that when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> turned himself in Sunday, he was `` said to be so exhausted from the chase that he could barely speak.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been on the run since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations began six days earlier, and said he never was in command of the Panamanian Defense Forces which resisted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers. A task force composed of officials from the departments of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, as well as <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, was formed to tackle the negotiations on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s fate. The group conducted most of its meetings in telephone conferences. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rejected the idea that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might be entitled to political asylum. Under international law, such asylum can only be granted on the grounds that a person is subject to persecution because of religious or political views, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> does not fit either category,'' he said. `` His fears are of prosecution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on two indictments.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had offered <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> a deal as recently as October if he would step down, but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> refused. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not compromise with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> now, he said. Meantime, one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the pope's representatives have contacted several Latin American and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries in hopes one will agree to take <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` He has no place to go yet,'' the official said. `` No one wants him.'' Officials said there was no way <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could flee from the nunciature because it is surrounded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops intending to remain in place as long as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is inside. `` There's no way he can get out,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` But by the same token, we do not have the authority to go in and take him out because of international law.'' <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, back from a Christmas Day tour of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> where visited an estimated 26,000 troops, said the situation in the country was `` much quieter than it's been'' since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion last week. Despite occasional sniping incidents, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the `` overwhelming sense is a return to normalcy.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military did its job,'' and now `` the lawyers and the diplomats have to take over.'' If the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> continues to improve, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might speed up the withdrawal of troops. He gave no timetable, though. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Panamanian citizens have been turning weapons over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and revealing the whereabouts of large weapons caches. `` The best I can tell you is that about 33,000 weapons have now been captured, discovered, or turned in,'' he said.

 An Israeli officer fatally shot a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protester in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Tuesday, and an Israeli-owned bus was reported set ablaze by masked <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> assailants in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as passengers fled the vehicle. A group of army officers' wives demanded on Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> either resign or accept responsibility for orders they claimed he issued to soldiers in the occupied territories. On Monday, the army announced plans to court martial Israeli Col. <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>, accused of ordering troops to beat and break the legs of 20 bound and gagged <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> detainees in January 1988. <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Orna </PERSON>, and other officers' wives claimed <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> gave the orders to brutalize the Palestinians. Tuesday's violence came a day after a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaflet urged Palestinians to escalate attacks on Israeli forces between Christmas and the New Year `` to honor the Palestinian revolution.'' At least 640 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during the two-year uprising against the occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.

 Searchers on Tuesday found the body of a second victim of a Christmas Eve explosion at <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s giant refinery here that damaged buildings six miles away. Property owners, meanwhile, flooded the plant's office with calls about damage caused by the storage tank blast. Elsewhere, heating oil futures prices surged on speculation that the damage to the nation's second-largest refinery, combined with a recent record-setting cold wave, would tighten home fuel supplies. Heating oil for January delivery jumped 10.74 cents to 92.48 cents a gallon on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Officials said they were trying to determine whether the second body was that of an Exxon worker missing since the blast. The missing worker's name has not been made public. Some workers reported seeing him Sunday after the explosion, but he has not been seen since. `` The family of the missing employee has been notified and is being updated on the status of the identification effort,'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. Previously, the company said mechanic <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillory </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Erwinville </LOCATION>, an employee of a contractor, died when his pickup truck caught fire near the explosion. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the company did n't anticipate any immediate effect from the blast on its ability to supply heating oil. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said there was some flexibility in the Exxon refinery network, which includes refineries in <LOCATION> Baytown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Linden </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. Asked about long-term supplies, company spokesman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> said, `` We think we will be able to meet all our commitments.'' Investigators from Exxon were still working to determine the cause of the explosion. More than 1,000 <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> area residents have called Exxon with complaints that their houses were damaged by the explosion. <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials will begin Wednesday to inspect the claimed damages. The Christmas Eve fire engulfed two large storage tanks, holding a combined 3.6 million gallons of heating oil, and three smaller tanks with about 882,000 gallons of lubricating oil, officials said. The refinery has a capacity of 455,000 barrels _ more than 19 million gallons _ of crude oil a day. The <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> were investigating the accident.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agents have been poring over thousands of seized documents that are providing valuable intelligence on international drug trafficking, authorities said Tuesday. They said the information could be used against Panamanians under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug indictments, such as Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his associate, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON>, who has been arrested and taken to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. One windfall was the headquarters of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers stormed the headquarters Monday and detained three men after being tipped off by an informant, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Leszczynski </PERSON>, commander of the 3rd Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment. Authorities reported finding rifles, shotguns, handguns and much ammunition as well as cocaine, marijuana, morphine and drug paraphernalia. Torture apparently was carried out in the same building. <PERSON> Leszczynski </PERSON> said his troops found `` electronic devices that could be hooked up to people for electric shocks.'' They found a room filled with immigration files of foreigners from more than two dozen countries, including <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The files, in racks that reached the ceiling, contained detailed information on foreigners' entries and exits. Each file had a small photo of the subject. One Miami-based agent of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> who visited the white stucco house Tuesday said that at first glance, it seemed to be a legitimate anti-narcotics operation. `` What I find unusual is that these files were kept in a house,'' she said. `` I need to find out whose house this is, in whose name it's registered.'' She spoke on condition of anonymity. The files largely were from the 1960s through the 70s. `` It's good for us,'' the agent said. `` This tells me who's been in an out of the country. I already found some files of Colombian drug traffickers. So now I know they were here. Now I go for the more recent files.'' She would not say how many <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents came here, although she said it was far fewer than 20. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military has provided transport, communications and other support, she added. Three makeshift jails at the back of the house seemed to have been inhabited recently. A plastic container with urine stood in the corner of one cell, where the occupant had slept on a dirty mat and cardboard placed on the cement floor.

 More than 150 members of an outlawed Tamil militia surrendered to the Sri Lankan army Tuesday after trekking through the jungle for three days to escape rival Tamil guerrillas. The weary members of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> contacted the Sri Lankan army Monday in northeastern <LOCATION> Nidamwela </LOCATION> town and were brought to a makeshift detention center 30 miles away, military officials said. They surrendered a few hours after guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> attacked a <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> camp, killing 44 militants in the <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> district, the officials said on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest guerrilla group in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Tamil ethnic minority, have intensified their power struggle with rival Tamil militants as <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping troops wind down their 2 -LCB- - year effort to pacify the northeastern part of the island The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> and the Sri Lankan government claim the departing Indians have armed and trained 4,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has repeatedly insisted it only trained a volunteer force sanctioned by the Sri Lankan government _ and not the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has been outlawed by President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s government. Indian troops started arriving in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> July 30, 1987, under an accord with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in an effort to settle the insurrection. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> reneged on the accord and attacked the Indians, who were supposed to oversee a surrender of arms. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> agreed in September to withdraw its last troops by Dec. 31 but later said it was unlikely to meet that deadline. An estimated 25,000 Indian soldiers remain. Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people, claim discrimination by the majority Sinhalese, and Tamil militants want a separate homeland. The revolt has claimed 11,000 lives since it started in 1983. The 155 militants had slipped out of the camp Friday in search of food but had been spotted and pursued by the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, one of the militants told reporters who were flown to <LOCATION> Polonnarywa </LOCATION>, 100 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. `` We do not want to go back, we will be killed,'' said a young Tamil in the abandoned warehouse housing the militants. The military officials said the guerrillas, most aged 18 to 24, were being held in protective custody in the barbed wire-fenced warehouse. He said the militants would be flown to <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> soon. The officials displayed an array of weapons they said had been seized from the militants. Officials in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said the arms included 83 Soviet-designed AK47 assault rifles, a light machine gun, four submachine guns, five mortars, two rocket launchers, five hand grenades and a cache of ammunition. On Monday, soldiers killed seven Sinhalese militants in separate battles in north central <LOCATION> Anuradhapura </LOCATION> and central <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION> districts, a government statement said.

<TEXT>
 A numbing Christmas freeze caused widespread damage to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> crops, but citrus growers were optimistic Tuesday that trees suffered little damage and much of the iced fruit can be turned into juice. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s third major killer freeze in six years was not believed as disastrous to citrus as those in December 1983 and January 1985. But near-total losses were reported in winter vegetables _ much of it destined for Northeastern markets _ in large areas of the state. Agriculture officials said it was too early to estimate the financial losses. In some cases, the full extent of damage will not be known for weeks or months. Elsewhere, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials estimate 70 percent of that state's citrus crop and 80 percent of the winter vegetable crop were destroyed by the cold weather Sleet, snow, rain and wind combined with temperatures ranging from the teens to the high 20s throughout the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> peninsula during the weekend. The cold contributed to at least seven deaths and caused burst water pipes and other problems for residents used to sub-tropical December weather. The multibillion-dollar citrus industry was still recovering from the earlier freezes that wiped out some 250,000 acres of trees. But many growers believed the major damage this time was confined to the fruit. `` I do n't think it was a tree-killing freeze,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION>. More than 80 percent of the citrus crop was still on the trees when the cold arrived, and few groves escaped damage in the 700,000-acre citrus belt. Vegetables, strawberries, ornamental plants and other crops were also hard hit. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said there were heavy losses of beans, squash, corn, tomatoes and watermelons. He said he hoped enough citrus and vegetables could be salvaged to maintain market supplies. `` With shortages, naturally prices will go up. I just hope that we have enough fruit to keep a rather stable market because everyone prefers to have product in the marketplace rather than heavy limitations on supply and unreasonable prices,'' the commissioner said. <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> growers said thousands of acres of carrots, radishes, cauliflower and broccoli were destroyed and little would be salvageable. The $ 1 billion foliage industry, one of the state's fastest-growing agriculture commodities, suffered a minimum of 20 percent losses statewide, said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurserymen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> Almost 90 percent of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> orange crop goes into juice. <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> said the citrus industry had large stocks of juice concentrate. That stock and the larger-than-normal <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> citrus crop should stabilize juice prices somewhat, he said. `` Because of that, there might be a more moderate impact than we might expect for a freeze year,'' <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> said. Nevertheless, commodities traders sharply bid up the price of orange juice futures Tuesday, speculating that the freeze would cause a scramble for supplies. The January contract for frozen concentrated orange juice rose 16.1 cents to $ 1.531 a pound on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Harvesting crews were out in force in bright, sunny weather Tuesday. Citrus growers rushed to pick early and midseason oranges and grapefruit and get them to processing plants to be turned into juice before spoilage. Ironically, growers now hope the cool weather will stick around for a week or so during the citrus harvesting and round-the-clock processing. Temperatures forecast in the 60s and 70s later in the week would hasten juice loss in the damaged fruit. Rapidly rising temperatures in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> blocked efforts to salvage frozen fruit for juice. Growers said they were dealt the fatal blow Monday when temperatures shot into the mid-50s, reducing the frozen fruit to mush. `` It appears to me even the canneries would n't accept it because the fruit has been frozen so bad,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutzenberger </PERSON>, president of KY Farms in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It's turning soft and even bleeding through the skin of the fruit. I would say it's a total loss.'' Losses to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> citrus industry are estimated at $ 200 million so far and could top $ 500 million as trees begin to show effects from the freeze, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it would not invoke emergency rules limiting shipments of fresh fruit that suffered icing. Commission Chairman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said the industry was relying on the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegetable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, to ensure the quality of fresh-fruit shipments.

The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> put off discussion on <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Tuesday because of resistance by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said only that the Romanian question, which had been placed on the agenda, had not been taken up. There was no comment from Chinese diplomats. Weeks of pro-democracy protests in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> earlier this year were crushed by troops in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says about 300 people died, 200 of them civilians. Witnesses and Western security sources say the toll may range from 500 to 3,000. In <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the new revolutionary government says more than 12,000 people were believed slain during a week of protests against the rule of ousted leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who ordered troops to shoot demonstrators. Mass graves were found in the western city of <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> government wants to avoid any comparison with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has reacted sharply to international criticism to its crackdown. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats familiar with council proceedings said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, with the support of some developing nations, argued that the situation in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was strictly an internal affair and the international community should not become involved. Other diplomats argued, however, that the instability in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> threatens <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and that maintaining international peace and stability is a legitimate concern of the 15-nation <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> last week requested that the issue a statement about the crisis in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. They suggested the council could deplore the violence among the demonstrators, army and security forces and call for an orderly transition to democracy. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, however, refused Saturday to permit <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Penalosa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to read an informal statement of concern to reporters. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is one of the five permanent council members with veto power and can block a statement. A council statement requires a concensus. The five permanent members are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

It revokes family planning restrictions, rules on talking to foreigners and allows Romanians unrestricted ownership of such once-regulated items as typewriters. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> loses control of the security forces, which are put under the jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which controls the army.

<HEAD>Yugoslav Communists Propose Ending Monopoly on Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Central Committee of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> recommended Tuesday that the party adopt a proposal to end its 45-year monopoly on power in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The party will consider the proposal at its January congress in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. The Yugoslav <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was the first to break with the monolithic communist bloc in 1948. But <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has been slower to adopt many of the democratic reforms now sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Secretary <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Korosec </PERSON> told the 165-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> the party is ready for competition of `` equal political partners.'' <PERSON> Korosec </PERSON> said the party will embark on reforms `` not to reject the idea of socialism, but to preserve and develop it further.'' The draft is a `` result of ambition to prove that we ... do not find ourselves at the tail of reforms in socialism,'' he said. Other political parties have already been allowed in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, two of the six republics in the Yugoslav federation. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the largest republic, decided this month to allow other parties with some restrictions. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has a population of 23.5 million.

<HEAD>Jews at Western Wall Celebrate Hanukkah with World via Satellite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Several thousand people at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Western Wall celebrated Hanukkah Tuesday via satellite with Jews in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The mostly ultra-Orthodox crowd watched quietly as prayers were chanted and the fifth candle was lighted in all five cities in the first high-tech global Hannukah ceremony. Hannukah, the eight-day festival of lights, celebrates the victory of the Jews over the Greco-Syrian kingdom in 165 B.C. The kingdom tried to impose its culture on the Jews and desecrated the holy temple in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> with statues of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> gods. According to legend, when the Jews entered <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and tried to rekindle the temple's eternal flame, they found enough oil for one day, but the oil miraculously lasted eight days. To commemorate the miracle, Jews light candles at sunset for eight consecutive days. The Western Wall, where the candle-lighting ceremony was held, is the sole remnant of the second Jewish temple and the holiest site in Judaism. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabakoff </PERSON>, a 60-year-old tourist from <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, watched one of two screens facing the Western Wall with excitement. She said she heard about the satellite ceremony in her hotel, from announcements in the streets over loudspeakers. `` I think it is wonderful that Jews feel that strongly about their faith to join together. It makes me want to cry,'' she said. The candle in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was lighted by Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi <PERSON> Mordehai </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliahu </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two chief rabbis. The <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> crowd listened to a speech in Yiddish from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, by the <PERSON> Lubavitcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebbe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneerson </PERSON>. The rabbi's Habad movement sponsored the satellite ceremony. <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodzin </PERSON>, an 18-year-old seminary student from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said the highlight for her was watching children in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> celebrate Hannukah. `` I think it's amazing. Look at all the people here. This one TV show is tying together the Jews from all over,'' she said.

<HEAD>Farm Group Calls for Conference to Increase Food Aid to Eastern Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional leaders Tuesday to work with farmers to increase agricultural exports to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Food will assist Eastern bloc nations more than dollars and, at the same time, help the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural economy,'' said <PERSON> DeVon </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Blackfoot </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, a rancher and president of the Iowa-based <ORGANIZATION> NFO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Woodland </PERSON> said studies indicate that countries that received assistance under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Food for Peace program have become friends of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and developed into trading partners. The same can not be said of countries receiving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial aid, he said. `` Why dollar aid when people in the Eastern bloc countries have no food available to buy? We are the richest and most abundant agriculture country in the world. We should use this food to, or at least a portion of it, for assistance to the hungry,'' <PERSON> Woodland </PERSON> said in a statement released by <ORGANIZATION> NFO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <PERSON> Corning </PERSON>. The group represents more than 250,000 farm families and markets farm commodities for its members. Woodland said food shipments to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would reduce grain surpluses, and thereby push up the prices <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers receive for their crops. He urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agriculture committees to consider establishing a federal agriculture conference to help increase exports of food to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Round-Table Talks Next Week; General Strike Called Thursday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ruling Communist Politburo on Tuesday proposed round-table talks on the country's future with other official and newly active opposition groups. The action came after an independent trade union, Podkrepa, proposed warning strikes for Wednesday, presumably in selected places, and a general strike Thursday to push demands for the talks. It was not clear whether the Politburo offer was in response to <ORGANIZATION> Podkrepa </ORGANIZATION>'s threat of the first general strike in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover after World War II. It also was not clear whether the strikes would go ahead as planned. Podkrepa is one of several opposition groups that have been allowed to function publicly since <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> was ousted as Communist leader Nov. 10. An initial meeting took place Dec. 15 between the ruling Communists and representatives of opposition groups. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>'s ouster came amid a wave of change that swept the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, beginning with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and spreading to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, who took over from <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, has pledged to scrap the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s monopoly on power, remove its guaranteed leading role from the Constitution and hold free elections by May. Also Tuesday, reform Communists demanded the resignation of the entire existing party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, elected under <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, and announced plans to split from the party and form a faction known as the <ORGANIZATION> Alternative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The group will hold a meeting Jan. 12, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> reported. The group also wants the party to share with emerging alternative parties the extensive property amassed over the last four decades, its funds and printing presses, <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> probably went by himself to the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and decided to seek asylum after his aides abandoned him or were arrested, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. It said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was never in charge of his <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion on Dec. 20 and did not contact any of its members for fear of a trap. During the fighting, military spokesmen had said the resistance was centrally directed and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved. In a brief communique released to reporters, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> gave an account of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s time after the invasion based on what it said were interviews with his cronies. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> at one point considered `` fleeing to the mountains to mount an insurgent attack, but he was concerned about his heart while living in difficult terrain without the opulent luxuries and intensive medical care'' to which he had become accustomed, according to the communique. It quoted aides who were interviewed as saying <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> wore red underwear to ward off the `` evil eye.'' The communique said that before the invasion, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had dismissed the possibility of an attack by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and was in Colon, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, inspecting a new military facility. `` He was aware of increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force activities but discounted the notion of an attack, passing the increased activity off as more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> posturing,'' the communique said. It said that about 6 p.m. on Dec. 19, he was dropped off at a <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> club in <LOCATION> Tocumen </LOCATION> near the Omar Torrijos airport. `` There he was provided a prostitute by one of his aides _ apparently a routine occurrence,'' it said. When <PERSON> Tocumen </PERSON> was attacked about 1 a.m., <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> left the club and evaded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces by driving around <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, according to the communique. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s first telephone call after the invasion was to his mistress, <PERSON> Vicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Amado </PERSON>, and that he never tried to contact his wife, <PERSON> Felicidad </PERSON>. It said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was `` agitated'' and spent the days at various locations, mostly at the home of relatives of his private secretary, <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Tason </PERSON>. His supporters tried to make him leave town but he refused, it said. It added that at one point, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was believed to have contacted the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> ambassador and considered going to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s embassy but backed off because the compound was surrounded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had set a $ 1 million bounty for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> decided to go `` single-handed'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> after one of his commanders, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON>, surrendered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 200 miles west of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> was indicted in 1988 along with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug trafficking charges. He was flown to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Monday. Other people were seen entering the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> at various times on the same day <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> went there. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that `` 10 associate thugs'' of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sought asylum Sunday afternoon at the embassy, the Papal Nunciature.

 Police on Tuesday were looking to question a bicyclist seen riding near this small upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> town shortly before a family of four was shot to death and set afire in their suburban home. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 39, his wife, <PERSON> Delores </PERSON>, 41, their daughter, <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, 15, and son, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON>, 11, were found dead Saturday morning after neighbors in the affluent suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Ellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hollow </ORGANIZATION> heard their fire alarm and called authorities. All four had been shot once through the head between 6 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Friday. Police have given no motive for the crime, although they said some money may have been taken from the purse and wallet of the Harris couple. Investigators said there was no evidence of a break-in, but an inside telephone wire was pulled from the phone. A bicyclist riding in near zero-degree weather was seen at about 4:30 p.m. last Friday heading toward <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> along a road where the family lived, state police said. A witness saw the bicyclist but could not describe the sex, race or age because the rider was wearing a parka, said Capt. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaver </PERSON> of the state police's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION>. Three of the victims were tied up in one room before being shot while the fourth was found on the floor of another room, said Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrand </PERSON>, acting commander of state police Troop C. The bodies of all four then were doused with gasoline and set on fire, <PERSON> Farrand </PERSON> said. Violence is relatively uncommon in the area. The deaths raised the number of killings to only six this year around <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, a city of 26,000 that is home to <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The Harrises lived between <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON>, about 10 miles to the east. The family's van was found Saturday about 5 miles east of their home at an <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION> shopping center. Police believe the killer or killers used the van to flee. <PERSON> Shaver </PERSON> said he felt only one person was involved in the killings, but he said that had not been firmly established. Autopsies were begun Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Onondaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s office. Results were expected to be released Wednesday or Thursday, police said. `` They are doing an extremely thorough, detailed job,'' <PERSON> Shaver </PERSON> said. Medical examiners were looking not only for the cause of death but also for any indication of what happened to the <ORGANIZATION> Harrises </ORGANIZATION> before they were killed. <ORGANIZATION> Deanco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an Ithaca-based electronics distributor where <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was employed as East Coast sales director, is offering a $ 5,000 reward for any information that leads to an arrest of the killer, state police said.

 Deposed dictator <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> defiantly denounced the revolt that toppled him from power and refused to recognize the legitimacy of the tribunal that sentenced him to death, a videotape of his trial showed late Tuesday. Waving his arms and shouting with his forlorn wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, seated nearby, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> branded as lies the charges that the couple was responsible for the deaths of 60,000 during their 24-year reign and the crackdown on protesters last week. `` Everything that was said here was false, and I do n't want to talk any more,'' he declared at one point. `` I'm not guilty, I'm not guilty. I will answer only in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and in front of the working-class. These are lies,'' he said as the couple sat behind a table, with no other people in the room visible. Later, the videotape broadcast on Romanian television showed the bodies of the couple sprawled by a wall after their executions Monday by firing squad, the first confirmation for Romanians that their revolution had been won. An official said the couple that ruled their country together were granted their last wish: that their executions be carried out simultaneously. Hundreds reportedly volunteered for the three-member firing squad. The revolutionary <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which says it is a provisional government until free elections can be held in April, chose <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> as chairman of a new 37-member governing council on Tuesday. It also named as prime minister a professor who said he convinced the army to join the revolt. Additionally, the new government issued a decree that throws out some of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s most vicious and oppressive laws _ including those prohibiting contact with foreigners, free travel and even ownership of typewriters. The government also ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s brutal security forces be put under control of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the army that sided with the revolutionaries. According to radio and Romanian sources, security forces loyal to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> were surrendering by the hundreds Tuesday, apparently convinced of defeat by news of their ousted ruler's execution. But sporadic gunfire still rang through parts of the capital, where many buildings were burned or battered by the fighting between army units backing the revolution and secret police loyal to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife were reported captured on Saturday and tried and executed two days later. Television early Tuesday broadcast the first footage of the couple in captivity, along with the film of their bodies. The 71-year-old <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> looked gaunt and unshaven and denied that he ordered the brutal suppression during last week's protests against his rule. His wife, sometimes restrained from speaking by her husband, defiantly blasted back at unseen prosecutors accusing the family of stashing hard currency in Swiss banks. `` Prove it,'' she retorted. `` This is a base provocation.'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> denied that there were deaths in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>'s Palace Square on Thursday, when there were reports that troops fired on protesters who turned out for his failed pro-government demonstration. `` Nobody was shot in the Palace Square,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said. `` Do you know that you were sacked as president and as supreme commander of the army?'' the court asked at point. `` No, I do not recognize this. I am the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romania </ORGANIZATION>,'' he replied. The government said the couple was tried by a secret military tribunal for grave crimes against the Romanian people, including genocide and ruining the economy. It said the genocide involved the deaths of more than 60,000 people during their 24 years in power. The government also said the couple had stashed more than $ 1 billion in foreign banks. A military officer who asked not to be identified said 300 soldiers volunteered for the firing squad, but only three were chosen. The <ORGANIZATION> Ceausescus </ORGANIZATION>' last wish was to die together, he said. `` All of us wanted to see the dictator shot. You have seen it, the dictators have been executed!'' exulted a <ORGANIZATION> Bucharest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> announcer. For some, however, even death was too good for <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who ran a network of terror with 700,000 secret police and imposed rationing on his people while exporting food to pay for monuments to his own glory. `` He should be stripped naked, and his body paraded through the streets,'' said <PERSON> Dimitru </PERSON> <PERSON> Minca </PERSON>, whose 14-year-old grandson was among <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s victims. Still in custody and facing trial was <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s eldest son, <PERSON> Nicu </PERSON>, and a daughter, <PERSON> Zoia </PERSON>. Thousands of people were reported killed as <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> tried to crush burgeoning protests that began Dec. 15. The army joined the uprising Friday, forcing <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> to flee, and thousands more are believed to have been killed during the fighting with pro-Ceausescu forces. A group of dissidents, intellectuals, disaffected government officials and rebellious army commanders have been trying to run the nation under the umbrella name <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, the committee said <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, 59, would remain chairman of the committee. Reputed to be a college chum of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he was an early rising star under <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> but was demoted in 1971 after disagreements over the dictator's style and his pace of reform. It also named <PERSON> Petre </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON>, a 43-year-old professor of hydraulic engineeering with no political background, as prime minister. The government has been headquartered at the TV station, scene of some of the heaviest fighting. During one attack Friday, <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> told reporters he was on the committee because he helped persuade the army to join the revolt. Named as defense minister was Gen. <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Militaru </PERSON>, who retired eight years ago from the army as commander of the <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> garrison, one of many military men toppled by <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, whose distrust of the army grew after an attempted military coup in 1984. Because of the new decree, <PERSON> Militaru </PERSON>'s duties now will include command of all security troops. Under the new law, the only paramilitary units under the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> will be traffic police, firefighters and prison guards. The changes also scrap laws forbidding unauthorized contact with foreigners requiring intellectuals to live in the same city where they work _ a measure frequently used to banish outspoken voices to remote towns. Laws prohibiting abortions to women with less than five children and requiring registration of typewriters also were abolished, as were <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s plans to destroy thousands of villages and force people into shoddy new housing in towns. About 10 new political parties have been formed since Saturday, all weak and badly organized, and a small but noisy demonstration has already denounced the new government, some of whose members have promised free elections. About a thousand people gathered outside of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> building to demand that no Communists be included in any new government. They objected that the television station refused to cover them. `` These are the first days of liberty and already they are suppressing us,'' said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Radulescu </PERSON>, a doctor.

 Romanian TV on Tuesday broadcast footage of the secret trial of Nicolae and <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, showing the dictator and his wife defiant, unrepentant and dismissive of the tribunal that sentenced them to death. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, gaunt and looking his 71 years, repeatedly told the court he would answer only to the country's rubber-stamp parliament `` and the working-class'' for his actions. His wife, restrained from speaking several times when her husband put his hand on her arm or leg, blasted back at unseen prosecutors accusing the family of stashing cash in Swiss banks. `` Prove it,'' she retorted. `` This is a base provocation.'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> alternately remained silent after questions about his 24 years of dictatorial policy, or shouted replies in the raised voice he used in his most strident speeches. `` Everything that was said here was false, and I do n't want to talk any more,'' he said. `` This was a coup d'etat and I do n't answer your questions,'' he proclaimed at another point. The couple sat silently as the indictment was read, charging them with genocide of more than 60,000 people, the undermining of the state and the economy, the destruction of historic monuments and attempting to flee by hiding more than $ 1 billion in foreign banks. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> refused to answer key questions about who ordered the Dec. 17 shooting of unarmed civilians in the western city of <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> that precipated the popular rage that drove him from power. <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who was effectively in charge of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> Dec. 18-20 while her husband was in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, acted unconcerned when asked if she knew of the shooting in <LOCATION> Timsisoara </LOCATION>. `` What are you talking about?'' she demanded. `` Who ordered the shooting in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>?'' a voice asked, referring to the shooting of protesters in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> last Thursday, a day before the army backed the revolt and the <ORGANIZATION> Ceausescus </ORGANIZATION> were forced to flee. `` Nobody was shot in the Palace Square,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said. He was referring to the square where he addressed a pro-government rally Thursday that backfired and turned into a demonstration against him. The Ceausescus were captured Saturday in an underground bunker at an undisclosed location. They were tried, sentenced and shot to death by firing squad on Monday. Earlier Tuesday, the television broadcast scenes of their bullet-ridden bodies slumped against a wall. A close-up showed <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s face, his eyes open and blood on the right side. It has not been disclosed where and exactly when they were tried and shot after the secret trial. `` Do you know what's happening now? Why are these people fighting in the street?'' the prosecutor demanded, referring to street battles between security troops loyal to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and the army, which backs the revolutionaries. `` The people are fighting the gangs of traitors who in collusion with foreign forces organized this coup d'etat,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> answered. `` Do you know that you were sacked as a president and a supreme commander of the army?'' the prosecutor asked. `` No, I do not recognize this. I am the President of the Socialist Republic of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> replied. Asked why he exported food grown in the country and left his own people scraping by on meager rations, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> characteristically cited the inflated statistics he loved to use to justify his Stalinist policies. `` It's a lie that the people are hungry,'' he said. `` Why were the peasants going to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> to buy bread?'' retorted the prosecutor. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was silent. At another point in the 40-minute broadcast, he defended his hated plan to `` systemize'' the countryside by moving peasants from villages to shoddy new housing in agro-industrial centers. He claimed the plan would bring more civilization to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s tradition-rich peasantry `` I did n't want to destroy the villages, on the contrary it was a buildup of villages, they were supposed to get doctors, schools,'' he said. `` It was an improvement, not a destruction. They were to be the best villages in the world.'' The couple also was asked about the luxurious lifestyle of their daughter <PERSON> Zoia-Elena </PERSON>, captured by soldiers on Sunday. Television has shown footage of her opulent villa, containing jewels and other artifacts from national museums and her two lapdogs, said to have been fed with imported meat weighed on golden scales. `` We do n't have any villa,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> defiantly replied. Both he and his wife laughed when asked about the imported meat for pets. `` We lived like normal citizens. It's incredible what you are accusing us of,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said. `` Did you ever suffer from any mental disorder?'' <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> was asked at one point. `` Oh, what a base provocation,'' answered the woman who only a week ago reigned supreme in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> recognized <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new government Tuesday and lawmakers demanded to know why <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was warmly welcomed to the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> just days before he was deposed and executed, Iranian media reported. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced recognition of the provisional government in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> is certain that the two nations' ties will continue, and that after the establishment of the popular government in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, these relations will expand,'' the statement said. The ministry also informed the Romanian ambassador in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the Moslem equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, is ready to send medical aid to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> to help people wounded in the fighting that toppled <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the radio reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the Majlis, or parliament, summoned Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> to explain <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s official visit to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> from Dec. 18-20. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was deposed by a popular uprising on Friday. He and his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, were executed Monday after they were found guilty during a secret military trial of genocide and other `` grave crimes'' during his 24-year rule. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the midst of huge protests against his rule. His security forces fired on demonstrators, reportedly killing thousands. On Friday, the army turned against him, and <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was forced to flee his palace. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the issue of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s visit was `` snowballing as the biggest goof of the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The government appears increasingly embarrassed by its embrace of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who also had close ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Tuesday, seeking to avoid any comparisons to its own crackdown on protesters in June, succeeded in blocking debate on <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Iranian news agency said 45 deputies in the 270-seat Majlis demanded that <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> appear. The Majlis Foreign Relations Committee, which met with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> a day earlier, said Tuesday that his answers to their questions `` were not satisfactory enough.'' No details of the exchange were provided, but the Majlis and <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> sit in opposing political camps in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Majlis is dominated by hard-liners of the Islamic revolution opposed to opening <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to foreign investment and other pragmatic measures that <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> supports. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said in an earlier report that <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamshid </PERSON> <PERSON> Gowhari </PERSON>, be fired <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the dismissal `` was due to <PERSON> Gowhari </PERSON>'s failure to furnish the foreign ministry with a comprehensive report on the internal situation in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'' before <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s visit. <PERSON> Gowhari </PERSON> was dismissed only three months before he was due to return to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was given a red carpet welcome in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s second-biggest trading partner in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and during <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s visit he signed an agreement to buy 1 million barrels of oil and 1 billion cubic meters of gas a year. He met President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who termed <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s visit `` successful'' and noted that the grounds for economic cooperation were `` completely fertile. After <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> left and reports from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> illustrated the brutality of his regime, Iranian newspapers demanded an official explanation why the <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> leader had been allowed to visit <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> responded Sunday by saying the visit had been arranged after frequent requests from <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. But he stressed that Iranian leaders repeatedly advised <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> to `` bow to his people's demands'' while he was in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also has denied European reports that Iranians were fighting alongside <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s security police against rebel forces and that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had stashed a fortune in gold in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> banks. During <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s visit, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> praised <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> as `` the sole East European country rigidly adhering to its past government,'' a reference to the reform movements that have changed <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run television network lauded <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> while he was in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. This week, it broadcast commentaries criticizing his rule. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> claimed Tuesday that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> `` received a cold welcome'' and said that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, `` called off a scheduled meeting with him.'' The agency also said that while <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, `` protests were made'' in the Iranian parliament about the visit. None of the reported protests were mentioned by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-controlled media while <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>

 <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, a no-nonsense former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> casino regulator who once called <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> `` an obnoxious bully'' and was later appointed court trustee of a scandal-ridden Teamsters local, died Tuesday. He was 71. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, a South Orange resident, died about 3:25 a.m. at <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barnabas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION>, said a hospital spokeswoman who asked that her name not be used. She said she could not release a cause of death. `` I am saddened at the death of <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>,'' Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said in a statement. `` He was an individual of strong and firmly held positions and possessed a willingness to express them forcefully and articulately. He fought for his beliefs, both as a public servant and as a private citizen.'' <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, a longtime labor union official, joined the state <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> commission in 1981. His tenure was marked by his vote against issuing a gaming license to <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and his run-in with <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>. In 1984, he characterized the singer as someone who `` walks into a casino and exhibits himself like an obnoxious bully, forcing men and women to commit infractions because of the fear of losing their jobs.'' The comment came after <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and fellow entertainer <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> forced a blackjack dealer at the former Golden Nugget casino to deal from her hand instead of a plastic `` shoe'' which holds the cards. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>'s remark so angered <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> that he refused to perform in the state for a time. Outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> never feared letting others know what he thought. `` <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> had a lot of influence in a lot of areas for a long period of time,'' Read said. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> resigned from the commission in June 1986 and was appointed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> to run Union City-based Teamsters Local 560. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> had ruled in February 1984 that the 8,000-member Local 560 had suffered under `` an orgy of criminal activity'' for 25 years. In May 1987, <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> removed <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, saying `` more needs to be done in order to insure that the documented egregious pattern of racketeering activity does not re-emerge the moment that the trusteeship is ended.'' <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> later accused the government of trying to bust the union with the appointment of <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stier </PERSON>, a former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and director of the state Division of Criminal Justice. The union in 1988 held a government monitored election and returned to self-administration.

 Blustery cold weather and high upper-level winds Tuesday forced <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to postpone its first commercial rocket launch for a sixth time. Wednesday's scheduled launch of the Titan 3, with British and Japanese communications satellites aboard, has been rescheduled to 7:05 p.m. EST Thursday, said <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. `` Air currents in the upper atmosphere are too strong'' and recent near-freezing temperatures were too low for the Titan 3 to be launched safely, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. Wednesday's lows for the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> area were expected to be in the 40s, which would chill the Titan 3's solid fuel boosters to levels that are unacceptable for launching. Temperatures `` need to be in the 60s,'' he said. The rocket will carry <ORGANIZATION> Skynet </ORGANIZATION> 4A, a satellite for the British <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, and JCSAT-2, a satellite for the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> has been trying to launch the Titan 3 since Dec. 7 The company's foray into the highly competitive international commercial space business has been delayed four times due to bad weather and once because of a computer software problem.

 The following is an account of fighting in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> filed on Tuesday by <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Bocharov </PERSON>, a special correspondent for the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> TIMISOARA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> _ Shots can still be heard in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, a city in the western part of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. There are killed and wounded. Supporters of the overthrown dictator <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, mostly the personnel of the former security service <ORGANIZATION> Securitate </ORGANIZATION>, continue to offer armed resistance to the insurgents. In an attempt to hide from popular indignation, the extremists try to flee the city. As a rule, they take these desperate steps at night, firing at random at passers-by. We learned from our own experience that the insurgents had a good reason, when taking measures for ensuring the safety of work and travel of foreign journalists in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> and in the area around it. Eight journalists were wounded. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Huwe </PERSON>, a Belgian journalist, was shot dead by extremists on Monday. His car in which he was driving together with his three colleagues was fired at by anti-insurgent sharp-shooters. Army units are combing <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> districts and separate buildngs. They are acting in close cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> committee which assumed the duty to bring the situation in the city back to normal. Facts show that they are facing a strong and treacherous enemy trained in advance to stage repressions against the population. For example, a regular arms cache was found in the house of one of the heads of the security force. It is believed that there are many such arms caches in the houses of security officers. This is the explanation for continuing armed clashes in the streets of the city. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that the Securitate had been created to serve as the mainstay of the ousted regime. It had included well-equipped specialized units and a large network of informers. One should see the eyes of the people looking at the arrests of extremists. They are full of tears, of grief over the death of defenseless people during the shooting of the demonstration and hatred for the totalitarian regime. There is no doubt that the last hotbeds of resistance will soon be suppressed. The situation in the city is getting back to normal with difficulty and step by step. Residents met with satisfaction the order of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> that all the armaments should be urgently handed over to the authorities. People heeded the appeal of the <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> to return to their working places. Some grocery shops were opened. Tram, trolleybus and bus traffic was resumed. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> are now the most popular names in the city. To commemorate the victory of the people, they were given to its youngest residents, a boy and a girl, who were born after the overthrow of the regime. A proposal is being discussed in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> to make Dec. 22, the day when the revolutionary rejuvenation of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was started, a national holiday. On our way from <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, we saw trucks carrying the Red Cross flag. They were transporting to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> food, medicines and clothes. Aid to the Romanian people that suffered from the ousted regime is coming from many countries.

 Security forces in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> broke up three heroin smuggling rings, seizing millions of dollars of the drug and arresting 24 people, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said members of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION> in the northwestern province of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> confiscated 247 pounds of heroin worth an estimated $ 7.5 million the past few days. Security officers also seized a cache of weapons and ammunition, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The report said those arrested confessed to plans to bring three tons of narcotics into the province, which borders <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says it has arrested thousands of smugglers and pushers, executing at least 1,000 since authorities launched a nationwide anti-narcotics campaign last year. But opposition groups and human rights organizations say many political prisoners are among those executed.

 A fire that killed 16 people in a high-rise retirement center started on the first floor, but investigators have not narrowed down the cause, the city's fire chief said Tuesday. `` I do n't think we are looking at arson here. I do n't think we're looking into anything criminal,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Souder </PERSON>, assistant to Chief <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckles </PERSON>. The Christmas Eve blaze, the second fatal fire in the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevier </PERSON> center in two months, spread to the second floor and parts of the third floor of the 10-story building. Smoke traveled to all floors before firefighters brought the fire under control. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Trivett </PERSON> and his father, U.G. <PERSON> Trivett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, managed the retirement center, which was renovated as an apartment hotel for the retired in 1979, a year after the hotel closed. It was built as a hotel in 1924. `` This was an apartment house, with the residents all supposed to be able to care for themselves, cook their own meals and keep their own places clean,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Trivett </PERSON> said. It was not a nursing home, he said. `` We were planning to upgrade our facility with a sprinkler system,'' he said. `` We did n't feel uncomfortable about it. We felt it would be a good investment.'' <PERSON> Souder </PERSON> said a sprinkler system `` would have held -LRB- the fire -RRB- in check until we got there.'' The center, which housed 145 residents, has long concerned city officials, said City Manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. `` You have to be concerned any time you have so many elderly people in a 10-story building,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. When the building was opened as a retirement center in 1979 it was brought up to code, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said, but the building code at that time did not require sprinklers. Sprinklers are required under present code only if renovations are being done. State Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> may have to consider requiring sprinkler systems in older buildings after it reconvenes Jan. 9. In October, a 76-year-old resident, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, died of smoke inhalation a few days after a kerosene heater flared, caught his fifth floor apartment on fire. All residents were evacuated. Police said people wanting to retrieve personal belongings would be allowed inside the building later in the week. `` City crews are working to remove equipment and ice from the building to make it safe for citizens to enter the facility,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> was assisting those displaced by the fire. The agency said it received a donation of $ 10,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Mor-Flo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, a water-heater manufacturer based in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> with a factory in <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter whose `` Business Outlook'' column appeared in more than 50 newspapers across the country, has died at age 84. <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Rosalie </PERSON>, said she found her husband collapsed Monday near the doorway of their farmhouse in <LOCATION> Pipersville </LOCATION>, 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. He was taken to <LOCATION> Doylestown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he was pronounced dead. A hospital spokeswoman declined to give any details of <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>'s death Tuesday. `` He was one of the outstanding journalists of his time,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive editor of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> and president of <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> started his twice-weekly column in 1945 and used the Inquirer as his base from 1972 until his death He also was financial editor of the now-defunct Bulletin in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> from 1948 to 1968, and held the same title briefly at the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Record before that newspaper closed in 1947. The Inquirer said <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>'s twice-yearly survey of economists was one of the nation's first consensus economic forecasts. He won his Pulitzer in 1964 for a series of articles titled `` The Power Pull of the Dollar.'' They described how communist countries, particularly those of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, were being pulled toward the West by a variety of economic forces. <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> received a number of other awards in business journalism, including the Loeb Award four times, the Hancock Award three times and the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> award for excellence in business reporting from abroad three times. <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> said he developed an interest in economics after he and a group of friends got together one night and decided to invest jointly in the stock market. That was in September 1929. The stock market crashed the next month, heralding the Great Depression. `` I decided then that I ought to find out more about business and finance,'' <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> once said. He took courses at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and became editor of a business publication called the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. In 1935, he became editor and economist at Business Week, a post he held for seven years. While there, he successfully argued in favor of writing about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest in the war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I was a pariah among the isolationists,'' he said. `` But I said it was our war, that we should enter into it, that it would be a disaster for <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> to win.'' After the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> entered the war, <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to work as an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and later the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion. He began his column in 1945, when his first client was The Washington Post. He started his survey of economists in 1946. In 1978, the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> computerized the information from <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>'s previous surveys and today continues to produce the <ORGANIZATION> Livingston </ORGANIZATION> survey. He is survived by his wife and a daughter, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Herban </PERSON>, and a grandson.

 Several nations and the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> criticized <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new leaders Tuesday for executing dictator <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife without a public trial, saying a free <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> should live by the rule of law. But there also were expressions of understanding of the treatment meted out to the Ceausescus, and the country's new government gained increasing international support. By Wednesday, at least 18 countries _ including such past <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> supporters as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ had recognized <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which overthrew <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> Friday following a popular uprising. Tons of international aid streamed into <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sent a message to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s leader of the new provisional government, <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, noting that he `` took charge of the country at a difficult moment when Romanian patriots resolutely came out to save the nation from forces of despotism and terror.'' In the message, carried by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> assured the new government of Soviet support. The Soviet Foreign Ministry called the executions of the Ceausescus an internal affair. Spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said the decision `` has probably been made taking into account the aspirations and will of the Romanian people.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> joined several nations in criticizing the secret trial, and the Italian office of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> deplored the executions. `` The idea that the use of the death penalty can survive during the passage from the old regime to a democratic system provokes worry,'' the human rights group said. The Dutch government said it was `` concerned'' and expressed hope that `` the high principles of the rule of law will find their place in the new <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for which so many have fought to the utmost.'' The Dutch said, however, that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was responsible `` for the inhuman suffering inflicted on the Romanian people'' and said they were `` willing to take into account the possible connection'' between his death and efforts to quickly end `` the senseless bloodshed'' caused by elite police units loyal to the dictator. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said normal accepted standards were difficult during `` a civil war situation.'' `` Although one may regret a secret trial, at the time it was not really surprising,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who by custom was not identified. But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called the secret trial `` a sad birth to the new nation.'' <PERSON> Iolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Stranescu </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, echoed his assessment, saying: `` Our feeling is <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> should have had a public trial. It is not an excellent start for the new government.'' Fund-raising for <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> gained momentum worldwide. Two West German military planes carrying medical supplies and other relief equipment landed in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> Tuesday and the German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> prepared a convoy to leave by land. The British <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which launched an appeal Saturday, said Tuesday that it had received as many as 12,000 callers an hour and had raised more than $ 700,000. It said it had sent 30 tons of drugs and medical supplies to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was sending a planeload of medicine. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> again denied that Libyans were participating in events in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on the side of the pro-Ceausescu forces, <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> sent two cargo planes with medical aid and food to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, following two trains and ambulance convoys sent over the weekend, the official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where 400,000 Romanian immigrants and their descendants live, a two-hour radio show was held Tuesday to seek donations and pass on information about Jews in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> planned to send a six-ton shipment of medical supplies to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said two Romanian-speaking doctors would accompany the supplies. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Tuesday joined the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and at least nine other nations in pledging support for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday, the official -LRB- North -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> recognized the new government. <ORGANIZATION> KCNA </ORGANIZATION> was monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` We respect the road chosen by the <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> people and recognize the Council of the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> as the representative of the Romanian people,'' read a statement of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, quoted by the agency. Hungarian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said in a statement that hostilities between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> were at an end, and pledged his government's support for the new leadership. Relations between the two countries were traditionally strained over <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s claims that the ethnic Hungarian minority in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was discriminated against under <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. Tensions aggravated as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> increasingly embraced democratic reforms while <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> remained staunchly opposed to such reforms. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced its recognition hours after dismissing its ambassador to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> for failing to inform <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> of growing opposition to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> before he visited <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last week. Parliament demanded that Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> explain why <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was warmly received by Iranian officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, announcing recognition of the new government, said relations between the two countries `` will expand.'' <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s second-biggest trading partner in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and during <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s visit he signed an agreement to buy 1 million barrels of oil and 1 billion cubic meters of gas a year. The <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it was `` ready to continue to maintain and develop its friendly relations with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> maintained good relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> over decades of hostility between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the rest of the Soviet bloc and was one of the few socialist leaders to praise the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership's crackdown of the student-led pro-democracy movement in June

The oil was fueling the fire and we started having explosion after explosion, with flames 150 feet in the air.'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said firefighters will spend the next couple of days spraying hot spots at the plant, and it will be several days before an inspection can be made to determine the cause of the fire.

 Survivors of a Christmas Eve sea accident in the southern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> claimed Tuesday they were attacked by a giant octopus that overturned their motorized canoe. Fishermen on Monday found 12 survivors clinging to the overturned craft and recovered the body of a two-week-old boy off <LOCATION> Manticao </LOCATION>, 17 miles from where the accident took place. All the survivors suffered from severe sunburn but none was seriously hurt, said <PERSON> Manticao </PERSON> police Cpl. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabasan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> said they had not received any report about the sinking in <LOCATION> Iligan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, about 490 miles southeast of the capital. `` Suddenly, the waters began to bubble,'' said survivor <PERSON> Agapito </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON>. `` Then with the use of flashlights, we saw something that looked like a giant octopus. It was as huge as an imported cow.'' <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON>, whose baby boy died, said the octopus grabbed the vessel's pontoons and overturned it. But the octopus submerged after the attack and did not harm them, he added. <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers said two other passengers of the 15 who were on the boat were found Monday. They quoted <PERSON> Eleuterio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarino </PERSON>, the boat owner, as saying the boat was submerged by huge waves. He did not mention the octopus.

 Police attacked a prison cell block controlled by jailed drug traffickers and rescued 18 hostages held for two days, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Tuesday. Six traffickers died and five hostages were injured in the bloody rescue operation Monday night. Also Monday in <LOCATION> Salgar </LOCATION>, a town 167 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, a group of unidentified men massacred six farmers, the <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> state governor's office reported Tuesday. An official communique said authorities still had not determined the motive for the mass killing, and that no arrests had been made. Right-wing death squads have killed scores of other peasants in the same part of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> the last year. Later Monday, two police officers were assassinated, apparently by members of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s largest and oldest guerrilla group in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vega </LOCATION>, a town 260 miles south of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cauca </LOCATION> state governor's office reported The assassinations apparently were carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombia </ORGANIZATION>, the communique said. The leftist guerrilla group has increased its activity in recent months. Last Saturday, members of the group ambushed an army patrol and killed 10 soldiers in rural eastern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> prison takeover ended Monday when police gained the release of all the hostages, including two children. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the situation at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Picota </LOCATION> jail in southern <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> had returned to normal. Authorities had been negotiating for two days with the prisoners, who took the hostages after a failed jailbreak Sunday. After subduing guards during visiting hours, the inmates, all jailed on drug trafficking charges, put on guards' uniforms in an attempt to escape, <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Tuesday. Authorities discovered the plan and sealed off the cell block before the prisoners could flee, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION> said, citing prison sources. The paper added that the cornered criminals then took hostages, including civilians who had been visiting their jailed family members. The prisoners initially protested the killing by police of <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel leader was slain Dec. 15 in a gunfight with police on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s northern coast. As a condition for the hostages' release, the inmates demanded that the administration of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> end its extradition of drug traffickers, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said. The administration has sent 11 drug suspects to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since last August when it decreed the policy. The uprising is the second by drug traffickers at a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> jail in less than a week. Five prisoners died last Tuesday in a knife battle between rival groups of convicted traffickers at another prison facility in the capital.

<TEXT>
 Most reporters dread the end of a year. This is because they are told to write a long story about the year's major stories and what it all means. But there are those who enjoy such work. His name is <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>. He is at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and he gets to grouse on `` 60 Minutes'' each week. This Thursday, he has 60 minutes of his own _ a little less, technically speaking _ to grouse or be amused about this year. His show, `` A Year With <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>: 1989,'' will arrive two nights after <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>' `` Images of the Eighties'' and one after <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>' `` The Eighties.'' Those are specials about the decade, not just one little year. <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>, who is more comfortable with a year, does n't mind doing `` year-enders,'' as they're called by journalists. `` As a writer, it's a lot of fun. All you need is something to write about. And here it is, all sitting there for you. And every event spurs an idea or observation. It's a great thing for an essayist.'' He is asked if this week's print and broadcast flood of year-enders and decade-enders has any real virtue. `` Well,'' he muses, `` does virtue have any real virtue? But I think if looking at where we've been helps us where we're going, yes, to that extent they have some virtue.'' <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>, 68, has done five other one-hour essays of the kind airing Thursday. The last was in 1985, when he took a helicopter across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for a bird's - eye perspective of In preparing a gimlet-eye perspective of 1989, he went by subject, rather than proceeding chronologically. Business, education, guns, communism's decline, and even certain TV people were among the subjects inspected. For example, he notes that <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was induced to leave <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2 million a year `` and the chance to work with <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>.'' In contrast, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, in leaving <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` only got $ 1.5 million. But she got to work alone.'' <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> began work on `` 1989'' last summer. When interviewed last week, he had just heard bad news from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> officialdom. They said that what he turned in exceeded an hour by one minute. This is not good, as he only really has 47 minutes he can call his own. Commercials and promotions for other shows get the rest of the hour. He returns with heavy heart and producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> to the editing room and starts throwing things out. A reflection on the death of the famous race horse Secretariat runs 24 seconds. Out. Who won the Superbowl, the World Series, and lesser championships run 40 seconds. Adios. The obituary of the anguished announcer who reported the flaming crash of the dirigible Hindenberg in 1937 took 40 seconds. Farewell to that, likewise a slightly shorter thought on former Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>. `` A lot of good weather'' got the boot, too, <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> says, `` although we kept Hurricane Hugo.'' Thirty seconds here, 40 there, 16 here, it adds up. But it is a heartbreaking task taking it all out after all that work to put it all in. On the bright side, <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> does have 47 minutes. `` They're doing the decade on the -LRB- CBS -RRB- ` Evening News' in two seven-minute sections,'' he marvels. `` How the hell do they do that?''

<HEAD>Upcoming: The Big Experiment With Market Economies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Perhaps no decade this century has begun amid greater economic unpheaval, challenge and potential than the 1990s, and it is n't due solely to the fall of Communist regimes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> too is in the midst of historic changes scheduled to begin in little more than a year with integration of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is facing adjustments because of competition. The American challenge is as big as any of them. It must solidify the great accomplishments of the 1980s, bring down inflation, steer the way through an economic downturn, reduce the trade deficit and balance budgets. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which ascended to economic dominance in many trade areas during the 1980s, is faced with demands to make its economy more receptive to imports, to reduce its trade surplus and perhaps to develop its infrastructure. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is trying to lift itself to world economic standards in the production of goods. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> faces a change of sponsorship from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and other small Asian nations face the challenge of remaining competitive while lifting living standards. Confronted with evidence of superior lifestyles in more highly developed countries, much of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> are in political and economic ferment that no longer can be repressed. Amid the confusion, there are few blueprints for the future so carefully defined as that of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. There is no clear procedure for turning centrally planned economies into market economies. Nor is there time to develop plans. Instant communication produces instant change, but contributes little toward identifying programs for carrying out the changes. The demands for change are swift, the implementation remains slow. Through all of the changes, however, there is at least one constant factor, opportunity. For major trading nations it means new markets. For underdeveloped nations it means the chance to radically lift depressed living standards. For all nations it means a more productive allocation of resources and skills. Managed well, the changes could be a great leap forward for the world community. Prospects for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, for example, already had brightened with the scheduled removal of trade barriers among 12 nations in 1992. Now, says <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, economic analyst with the investment counseling firm <ORGANIZATION> Bil </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Trainer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wortham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, `` there is the possibility of massive growth in international trade in the next 10 years.'' If that happens, he concludes, `` history tells us that greatly enhanced world economic prosperity will be the end result.'' No matter what economic changes occur throughout the world, they are bound to have an impact on domestic politics and economic direction within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Already <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is debating the possibilities of the so-called peace dividend, or billions of dollars in funds that supposedly will be available as a result of a cutback in defense programs. But that is only the beginning. If the world's experimentation with market economies continues, it will provide a showcase for those seeking to direct the American economy toward the most efficient ends. Conceivably, it could even mean an approach to that long-sought American goal of shrinking the federal government while maintaining and even improving services to the public.

 It was the unfinished symphony of the Cold War, all sour notes, now a relic of superpower chicanery that Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> will spend $ 270 million to tear down and replace: the office building of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, riddled with <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> bugs, never occupied.

 It is now 20 years since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to build new embassies for each other in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In that time, it is said, the ancient Egyptians built the Great Pyramid of <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION>. The pharaohs did n't have to deal with the Soviets. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> is still not finished and wo n't be. Eight stories up, $ 170 million spent, water and ice ravaging the most expensive bricks in the world, the administration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has now decided to stop there, raze the building to the ground and start over. That will add five more years, an additional $ 270 million to the cost of a modern tale of two cities, a lumbering farce of pachyderms unique to the late unpleasantness called the Cold War. Walls come down, liberty soars, but in the new age we are left with monuments to the buffoonery of the old. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> finished the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but the Soviets could n't move into their chancery until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> moved into its chancery in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. That was by agreement, one of several that took 13 years to reach in tense, careful negotiations. Every major move had to be precise, simultaneous and symmetrical. It was like two Mafia families trying to arrange a truce for a wedding. It took less than two years to build the 102-story Empire State Building in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1931. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the Soviets were into year seven and still not finished with the eight-story office building of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> threw them out. The problem was bugs. Mysterious, multitudinous, ubiquitous, anti-American, subversive, pre-glasnost, godless <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> communist bugs. In columns and walls, in concrete and steel, in breathtaking numbers and novel ways that confounded American experts, we were told, the Soviets had sown the chancery with diabolic devices to overhear, record and transmit American secrets. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused to move in until the bugs were moved out, but getting them out appeared tougher than evicting a poor relative. So tough, in fact, two administrations spent four years figuring out what to do. Both concluded the only safe course was to build a new building. Historically, there is no louder uproar among politicians and press than the thunder evoked by the suggestion that foreigners, especially the backward Soviets, had outwitted Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. The devilish dither of the embassies had all the makings. Sites. After 10 years of negotiations, we gave them <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> along <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, one of the highest points in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. They gave us a plot along <ORGANIZATION> Konyushovskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulitsa </ORGANIZATION> down near the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Uproar. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had given away a strategic height from which, electronically, the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> could look down the throats of the White House and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>! `` The view is terrific'' but the intelligence advantage is `` considerably less,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. What's more, other witnesses testified, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> was not the Soviet's first choice for an embassy and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had turned down an offer of <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> to be `` downtown.'' The high-low plot would n't play. Sidewalks. A hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Affairs. Back from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mica </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., reported: `` Where the new building is, -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- built us a 16-inch sidewalk so that there is no place to walk ... That is harassment.'' Rep. <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, R-Mass., asked if the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> pursued a `` reciprocity'' of harassment in building the Soviet Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> She seemed to think it should. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, director of the Office of Foreign Missions, replied: `` In the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, one does not cut down sidewalk size in half simply because the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> thinks it is a good time to do it or because we think that it is leverage to do it.'' Off site. Here was the real trouble. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Americans poured concrete for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> on site where the Soviets could watch. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Soviets poured concrete off site where Americans could n't, or did n't, watch. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> works at the problem of security penetration 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,'' testified <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, who investigated the embassy muddle for President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` If one signs an agreement that permits the Soviets to pre-cast columns and beams off site, the principal party to blame is oneself. ... As <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> once observed, there are limits to rascality, there are no limits to stupidity.'' The result, said the expert witness, was `` the best-bugged building ever built.'' It contained `` a full array of intelligence devices for which we do not yet understand either the technology or underlying strategy. ... We failed to allow for the boldness, thoroughness and extent of the penetration.'' During the building of their embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the suspicious Soviets watched every blow of the hammer. For every American working, said an American official observer of the Soviet observers, there was a Soviet watching. They X-rayed `` every inch'' of steel before it went up, said an architect. They watched concrete poured on site. If the work went too fast to watch carefully, they slowed the work. They insisted that window units assembled off site be disassembled and reassembled before their eyes. One result of their vigilance, the Soviets alleged, was the discovery of pencil-thin microphones in the walls and bugging wires in the weatherstripping of the windows put there by their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hosts. Another result: The windows now leak. Both embassy complexes include a chancery or office building, consulate, residential apartments, school, gym, swimming pool, playground, theater und underground garages. The new Soviet compound is in a residential area of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The new <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, like the old <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> next door, is surrounded by high-risers where it is assumed the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> is in constant attendance.

 Across the street is an old Russian church no longer used as such. Among American intelligence people, who say the place is loaded with electronic equipment for monitoring its neighbors, the old church is now known as `` Our Lady of Telemetry.'' Such was their mutual distrust, the superpowers needed 10 years to agree on an exchange of sites to be used free of charge for 85 years. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> got 11.9473 acres in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> got 12.5258 acres in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. It took three more years to agree on `` conditions of construction'' in two stages, each using local labor and materials in stage one and each using a mutually agreed maximum number of their own specialists imported for the second, or finishing stage. The original agreements stipulated simultaneous exchange of sites, simultaneous completion of construction, simultaneous occupancy of the chanceries. They also agreed to exchange architects' drawings and each would have veto power over the other. And, since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had no market economy on which to base costs, they agreed that cost calculation for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> construction would be based on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> prices. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> originally appropriated $ 192 million for the whole project. Now, says a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, it will be asked to come up with $ 270 million more for the new chancery. It will cost that much because, to play safe, all the labor will have to be brought in from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at American scale to build a building free of Soviet ears. Time schedules meticulously negotiated by the superpowers bent in the fluctuating heat of their Cold War and the numbing pace of Soviet labor. It took two years to finish most of the embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; the Soviets moved into the residential and support quarters in 1979. It took seven years to complete the equivalent in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and the Americans moved into those in 1986. All work had stopped. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had `` locked out'' all Soviet employees the year before for building an office building abounding in `` intentional defects.'' The invisible presence in the woodwork should have surprised no one. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, spying on visitors was older than borscht. The czars kept informers busy, and their proletarian heirs bugged the American embassy for years. So regularly that guests at <ORGANIZATION> Spasso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the ambassador's residence, were given cards welcoming and warning them: `` Every room is monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> and all of the staff are employees of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> We believe the garden also may be monitored. Your luggage may be searched two or three times a day. Nothing is ever stolen and they hardly disturb things. ... If you have anything sensitive to talk about, please call and make an appointment with the ambassador to discuss it in his office.'' The Soviets liked Ambassador <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Averill </PERSON> <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON> so much that they gave him a handsome replica of the Great Seal of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was years before the next ambassador found a tiny microphone nestled in the carved wooden eagle. Americans have also found, they said, more than 40 mikes in the walls of the old chancery, bugs in electronic typewriters, signs of microwave assaults on the building, wires leading to a tunnel between the embassy and a nearby Soviet apartment building, and traces of a `` spy dust'' called nitrophenylpentadienal by which the movements of people and objects could be tracked. Unintentional defects were equally hard on the psyche of Americans trying to get a new embassy built in the land of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. Which brings us to a tale of bricks told with a lingering shudder by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON>, chief architect. The plans called for the eight-story chancery to be faced in brick. No problem, said the Soviets. <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON> quickly found problems. Available Soviet bricks were rough and unattractive. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> looked promising but that did n't pan out. Likewise the kilns of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Finally, the right bricks were produced in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and more than a million were carefully strapped and packaged on pallets and shipped by boat to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> and by train to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, tenderly chaperoned all the way by Americans. There, the Soviets had to be stopped from ruining the bricks by heaving them into dump trucks for delivery. Then, <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON> watched with horror as Soviet bricklayers went to work using no strings or levels and setting bricks from inside a wall on irregular lines. `` Among Soviet workers, meeting quotas was all-important; it did n't matter if the wall fell down the next day.'' All work was stopped until master masons with proper tools could be flown in from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to teach and supervise. And it was stopped again with the discovery of the bugs, before the building was closed in properly and the well-traveled bricks could be protected from the weather. In their original negotiations in what seems like another age of man, the two parties set up a cumbersome process to arbitrate disputes. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has since claimed $ 29.9 million in damages resulting from Soviet delays and defective work. It has also given notice of intention to claim an undetermined amount for `` intentional defects.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> struck back with damage claims for $ 18 million resulting from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delays. Settlement is not just around the corner. Proving he was no imprudent country bumpkin, Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> took out a $ 42 million policy with the <ORGANIZATION> Granite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> 20 years ago. This was to insure the government `` against unforeseen and sudden physical loss or damage during construction.'' When last heard from, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had collected $ 14,287 from Granite State to cover the theft of construction materials from the construction site on <LOCATION> Konyushkovskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ulitsa </LOCATION>. Among the exclusionary clauses of the policy, the complex is not insured against damage from defects, intentional or unintentional. And should the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> be destroyed by nuclear war, Granite State makes clear it will not pay.

 Once considered a miracle fiber, asbestos is now recognized as a serious health threat and will be taken off the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in a series of bans beginning this year.

 <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s father began working for <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> in the 1940s, when asbestos was still considered a miracle fiber and no regulations governed its use. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> died in 1980 of cancer linked to asbestos. His son was hired by the same utility in 1979. In the years since his father first came in contact with asbestos, numerous laws had been passed to protect workers from what was now acknowledged as a prime health risk. But in 1987, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> says, he was working at a plant when asbestos-covered doors were removed from boilers and dropped to the floor. The doors remained for weeks while workers went about their duties without protective gear amid clouds of asbestos dust, he says. `` I used to walk past that area every day,'' he says. `` They told us it was safe. And it turns out it was n't.'' Now, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> has joined 180 co-workers and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in suing <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>, charging that he was exposed to the same material that killed his father. Eighteen years after passage of the first federal law regulating asbestos, thousands of workers _ at utilities like <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>, and in other industries where asbestos was used as an insulator _ still face its effects. `` We are talking to people who are extremely surprised that asbestos is still a problem,'' said <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Asbestos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the incidence of asbestos disease is on the increase instead of the decrease, despite restrictions that have been applied to make the use of asbestos safer.'' A recent union-sponsored screening of 538 <ORGANIZATION> Con </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> workers found that 20 percent had either scarred lungs or mesothelioma, an asbestos-caused cancer of the lining of the abdomen or the lungs. Since 1987, <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> has been cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for more than a half-dozen alleged violations _ mostly failure to monitor the level of asbestos fibers in the air _ at the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Buchanan </LOCATION>, a plant in <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, and at <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s 74th Street plant in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Some allegations are still under investigation, some have been contested and dropped by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> settled others by paying a fine. `` Prior to 1973, we did n't know what the asbestos risks were,'' said Con Ed spokeswoman <PERSON> Rosalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON>. `` We're not denying that prior to that time, there was exposure. But now that we're aware of it, whenever we do any asbestos work, we follow all the regulations.'' She added that since 1973, the company has had two medical vans visiting Con Ed plants, carrying X-ray machines to test for asbestos scarring. She would not comment on <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s suit. But <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> says the company was negligent in 1987, when he was exposed. The workers, he says, were kept in the dark. `` We did n't realize we were working around asbestos'til a shop steward took an air sample to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Because asbestos cancers can take 20 to 35 years to develop, workers like <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> who believe they have been exposed recently may not become sick until the year 2020. And people who were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s,'60s and'70s are just now getting sick. A study by Dr. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Selikoff </PERSON>, perhaps the world's most noted asbestos researcher, and his colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> projects that asbestos cancer rates wo n't peak until 1992 and wo n't drop off significantly until after the year 2000. Smoking exacerbates the risk of asbestos-related lung cancer, which is incurable in 70 to 95 percent of cases, said Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, who works with <PERSON> Selikoff </PERSON>. Mesothelioma is always fatal. Asbestos exposure also increases the risk of colon cancer, which has an 80 percent cure rate if caught early. The study predicts that 9,739 deaths from asbestos exposure will be recorded in 1992 in just 11 industries, including utilities, construction, car and railroad engine repair, shipbuilding, and asbestos manufacturing. Many Con Ed workers fear they might surface among those statistics: _ <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, 46, has worked for <ORGANIZATION> Con </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> for 25 years His chest X-rays show lung scarring; he often has trouble breathing. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said he ca n't even cut his lawn without taking a rest halfway through to catch his breath. _ <PERSON> Artie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagevick </PERSON>, 58, a 31-year veteran He gave up smoking 25 years ago, but he has `` coughing fits 15 minutes at a time a couple of times a day.'' _ Says <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>, a 21-year employee: `` If you had to do a strenuous job, go up and down stairs, I could not do it In the wintertime, I throw the phlegm all day long. ... I'm 51 years old and I feel like an old man.'' All three want compensation from <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>, more help from their union, and along with many of their co-workers, they are suing asbestos manufacturers. Lawyer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Placitella </PERSON> is handling similar suits by 130 Con Ed workers. His firm represents 3,300 additional workers from other utility companies who are involved in similar suits, and the number of plaintiffs rises daily. <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> has other asbestos-related worries. City officials have raised concerns about public exposure to asbestos from Con Ed accidents. In several recent incidents, asbestos insulation wrapped around underground Con Ed steam pipes has blown off when the pipes or nearby water mains burst. One explosion killed three people and contaminated <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s entire <LOCATION> Gramercy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> neighborhood with asbestos, forcing hundreds of people to relocate <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> was faulted for failing to report the presence of asbestos for several days, which delayed the cleanup and increased health risks. Other accidents contaminated streets and subways. The city <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> has called on federal officials to come up with new techniques to deal with these outdoor and underground emergencies, since the usual procedures have not always applied. Most asbestos products will be taken off the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market under a three-stage <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> ban that begins in 1990 and ends in 1997. Advocates for asbestos victims applaud the ban but wish more were being done. Asbestos manufacturers have filed a lawsuit challenging the ban, claiming today's products are safe because the fiber is encased in hard materials like cement and wo n't deteriorate. Whether or not the manufacturers are successful, <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> occupational safety expert <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Seminario </PERSON> predicts, `` It's going to be some time before our asbestos problems are over.''

 More than a century ago, <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> bade his charges, `` Go for souls and go for the worst.'' From a brick campus on the edge of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, officer candidates spend two years in classes and working in ghettos preparing to carry out that order. The public image of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is that of a brass band, the rattle of a tambourine and a blue-hooded woman on the corner with a bell and an iron kettle. Less visible are the officer cadets, men and women in their blue uniforms and sensible shoes, who some day will run one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most least-understood churches Yes, it is a church, a worldwide one with more than 260,000 members in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone. It costs the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> about $ 40,000 to put a cadet through the training program, described by Maj. <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Needham </PERSON>, principal of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> officer school, as a `` total immersion,'' heavy in hands-on fieldwork, usually in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s inner city. The school, one of four in the country, has about 90 students. The others are located in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verdes </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. Typically, <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> says, about half of the students who are commissioned will stick with the work until mandatory retirement at age 65. Most will start helping run smaller <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> missions or other programs and advance from there, probably in the South and probably not in their home areas. Work will include organizing shelters for the homeless, Christmas dinners and summer camps for poor kids, helping poor families with rent and food money and, of course, spreading the Word. Classes run the range from Bible study to social work to computer programming. It's a tough school to enter, a tough one to stay in. Many who make it are dropped, usually within five years of graduation. `` Some ca n't set limits for themselves,'' <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> says. `` Care-givers want to help. They are oriented that way and some people overextend themselves. They do n't realize that they can not be all things to all people.'' About two-thirds of the cadets are married, and both husband and wife must be in the program. The average cadet here is 27, probably finished high school and comes from a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> church in the 15 Southern states and the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> training school serves. Cadets live on campus and are not allowed to work during the two years. They get a bare-bones budget for basic needs and can look ahead to more of the same. An officer couple with more than 20 years in the program and two teen-age children receive living quarters, a car and about $ 250 a week. That may increase slightly with years of service, but not with rank. `` There is no financial incentive, `` <LOCATION> Needham </LOCATION> says. `` We're comfortable, but we do n't have any money. <PERSON> Needham </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Keitha </PERSON>, both are fifth-generation <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officers, and one of their children is interested in signing on. <PERSON> Needham </PERSON> holds graduate degrees from <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Candler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theology </ORGANIZATION>, but that much education is rare. `` This is not primarily an educational institution,'' <PERSON> Needham </PERSON> says. `` Educational institutions tend to create reactive modes, with students regurgitating what the teacher tells them. `` We prefer to nurture pro-active leaders who find their own talents and their own leadership abilities. Formal education is low on our list. We seek out people with basic competencies.'' The school insists on a 12th-grade reading capability, and candidates undergo rigorous psychological testing and interviews before being accepted. Minorities are encouraged, <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> says, and Hispanics, especially, are heeding the call. Black enrollment has begun to increase. Aside from <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officers, there are `` soldiers'' and `` adherents.'' Adherents, <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> says, consider the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to be their church but do not submit to the discipline. Soldiers and officers, for example, can not use tobacco or alcohol. Adherents can. Most of the training is done in slums and ghettos of inner cities, much like the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> slums where the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1865. Booth, <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> says, broke off from the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to create an evangelistic ministry that would inspire the working class poor and get them into established churches. `` But the local churches did n't want them,'' he says. `` They were smelly. They dressed shabbily. They could n't afford pew rental. So they went back and the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> became their church. It adopted, and retains, a working-class culture. `` In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> a brass band is a working man's orchestra; it's tremendously popular. The iron collection kettle originated in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> about 100 years ago when the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was collecting relief funds for families of victims of a shipwreck. It worked.

 Twice a year, 84-year-old <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertman </PERSON> makes the six-hour drive from his home in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, to his alma mater, the venerable, 172-year-old campus of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wertman </PERSON>, who graduated in 1928 from the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, returns to meet with other former directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the university's future _ much of which depends on alumni support. `` It's a continuous selling job to keep students interested after they graduate,'' <PERSON> Wertman </PERSON> says. `` And I still do my part, spreading the gospel of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, as I call it.'' Since graduating 61 years ago, <PERSON> Wertman </PERSON> has kept track of his 26 classmates of the Class of'28, bringing the remaining few together for reunions and keeping them active in university affairs. It's his contribution to a vast network that tries to keep track of some 330,000 alumni _ more than any other college or university in the country, according to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> City-based Council for Aid to Education. In the last decade, as public financing of higher education has decreased and the pool of potential freshman has shrunk, state-funded colleges and universities have taken a lesson from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s long-established alumni programs, considered one of the most successful in the country, even among its private counterparts. `` Our job is to cultivate alumni and keep them informed about what's going on here and the challenges we're facing,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for 25 years. That might involve an Alumni Association-sponsored African safari _ one of 35 trips abroad this year _ a week at one of the university's two family summer camps or a few courses at the <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a summer school for past grads. Of course, the highlight for the second consecutive year is an alumni trip to the Rose Bowl to root for the Big Ten football champion <ORGANIZATION> Wolverines </ORGANIZATION>. The bottom line is that the better alumni feel, the more likely they are to reach for their checkbooks. `` You used to find such professional programs only at your Yales and <ORGANIZATION> Harvards </ORGANIZATION>, but in the last 10 years or so public institutions have gone after and cultivated their alumni with a similar degree of sophistication and success,'' says <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> to Education. `` It's gotten so now you can phone in your credit card number to contribute.'' Today's efforts to keep alumni interested in alma maters go beyond newsletters, reunions and football telecast parties at local alumni clubs. Some associations have turned increasingly service oriented, selling members insurance, planning vacations and sponsoring continuing education courses. The strategy seems to be working. Private support of colleges and universities has nearly tripled in the last 10 years, says <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, whose organization tracks higher education fund raising. In 1987-88, alumni contributed about $ 2 billion to their alma maters, up from $ 1.2 billion in 1982-83 and totaling 25 percent of all voluntary support. At <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, about $ 22 million was raised by alumni, not counting the corporate gifts that result from having an alumnus on the board of directors _ or in the chief executive officer's seat. But at <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and many other colleges, the <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> rarely asks members for money. That's the job of the university's development office and its 17 individual colleges, which mail out two or three requests a year The Alumni Association works closely with the fund-raisers but is an independent, self-supporting organization with 80,000 dues-paying members _ about one-quarter of all <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> alumni. While fund raising and recruiting students remain the goals of most alumni associations, many also are enlisting members in a host of other activities, from advice on curricula and graduation requirements to screening prospective students and providing externships, in which students shadow alumni for a week or so to learn about prospective careers. `` Those schools who use alumni as a source for money only are missing the boat,'' <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> says. Some alumni clubs are even turning their efforts toward social service projects within their respective communities, tutoring at inner-city schools and volunteering at homeless shelters and soup kitchens, says <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardesty </PERSON>, vice president of communications for the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> alumni club in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, is renovating apartments in a public housing project and a <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> club in the same city has adopted an inner-city elementary school Even small, private institutions are getting into the act. More than 100 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> _ enrollment about 2,100 _ regularly volunteer at a food bank. `` We still have happy hours, football telecast parties and golf outings, but this is something we can get together and do for the community,'' says Notre Dame grad <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON>. `` And it makes us feel good about where we went to school.'' Still, reunions remain the mainstay of alumni contact. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> holds about 75 class reunions each year. There are <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> alumni clubs in about 200 cities across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as well as a few in other countries. In 1971, the all-Michigan crew of Apollo 15 established the first extraterrestrial club when they planted a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> flag on the moon. The list of famous <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> alumni ranges from President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to rock star <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> It also includes <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBiaggio </PERSON>, president of Big Ten rival <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Alumni associations are n't waiting until a student leaves the campus to get him or her thinking like alumni. About 180 students are involved in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s Student Alumni Council. At Notre Dame, the first thing a student sees when he comes to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, campus is the mobile <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> welcome wagon. `` From day one I felt at home at <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, and I've never lost that feeling,'' says <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicklas </PERSON>, class of'49 and a former director and vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. She also travels to <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> twice a year for the directors meeting from her home in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where she works in the development office at the University of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Though she received her graduate degree there, her commitment to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> runs deep; she's always in the market for a new outfit in the school's colors of maize and blue. `` It seems almost every place I've traveled in the world, I've met U of M graduates, and right away, there's that common bond,'' says the former sorority sister, her blue ` M' earrings dangling

 Three `` Trekkies'' who began operating out of a basement in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> have found there's money to be made in fan magazines and movie memorabilia. They're cashing in on the popularity of such TV and big screen hits as `` Star Trek,'' `` Star Wars'' and `` Back to the Future.''

 Three high school buddies who started a modest newsletter for fellow `` Star Trek'' fans a decade ago are now managing a multimillion-dollar nationwide enterprise. Star Trek: The Official Fan Club is the creation of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON>, who were drawn together by a common fascination with anything to do with `` Star Trek,'' the television series that inspired subsequent movies. The club, today just part of the men's enterprise called <ORGANIZATION> Fan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was inspired by the release of `` Star Trek: The Motion Picture'' in 1979. <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON>, now president of <ORGANIZATION> Fan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and publisher of the club's magazines, began putting out a small, photocopied newsletter for fellow `` Trekkies.'' `` We ran the thing out of my basement,'' <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON> says. `` You know, there were posters and all kinds of ` Star Trek' stuff on the walls.'' <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON> began with 15 subscribers to his newsletter. Today, 35,000 people subscribe to the `` Star Trek'' fan magazine. Their club is licensed by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> as the only official `` Star Trek'' fan club. <ORGANIZATION> Fan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> also operates fan clubs for `` Back to the Future'' and <PERSON> Lucasfilms </PERSON>, the movie company of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, producer of `` Star Wars'' and `` American Graffiti.'' Headquarters is a nondescript building in an <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> business park. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> estimates that fan club magazine sales will account for about 50 percent of the $ 1 million the company will earn this year, up from $ 400 in earnings just three years ago. He says that besides the 35,000 subscribers to the `` Star Trek'' magazine, the company's <ORGANIZATION> Lucasfilms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> has about 15,000 readers The inaugural issue of the `` Back to the Future'' fan club magazine should have about 16,000 readers. The men have high hopes for the `` Back to the Future'' magazine because of the release of the movie `` Back to the Future II'' over the Thanksgiving weekend. The magazines are slick, four-color publications averaging 25 pages. They feature interviews with stars, letters to the editor, behind-the-scenes looks at the technical wizardry and special effects of the movies and a list of upcoming conventions and events. They also contain order forms for merchandise and classified advertisements for members who want to buy, sell, trade and swap. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> says the magazines boast impressive renewal rates. `` Big magazines like Time and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> are happy if they get a 15 percent renewal rate,'' he said. `` Back when we had 5,000 subscribers, we had a 95 percent renewal rate. Now, with 60,000 subscribers, we have a 70 percent renewal rate. That's nothing to laugh at.'' The company also markets movie memorabilia, such as `` Star Trek'' mugs and action figures and <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> fedoras. Merchandise sales have shot up from nothing two years ago to about $ 500,000 this year, the entrepreneurs say. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> says fan club members include lawyers, 4-year-olds, grandmothers and priests. Schools and libraries subscribe as well. The three men initially took some ribbing from friends and relatives who were skeptical of the fan club's potential, but they learned the necessary skills to make it a success. <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON> worked in a print shop, where he learned how to lay out and design the newsletters. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> got a college degree in English, and <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> worked as a waiter to make ends meet. Soon after they began marketing merchandise in 1982, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> contacted them. `` They were concerned at first because we were operating and handling merchandise without a license,'' <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON> says. `` But they saw our newsletter and they were fairly impressed. So we signed a contract with them. They thought it had the right amount of fanaticism and the right amount of professionalism they were looking for.'' <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> have since traveled around the world to meet and interview the stars of the movies and series they write about. The license gives them exclusive rights to interviews and photographs and allows them to sell officially licensed merchandise. The three admit that <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> is n't exactly where one might expect to find the official `` Star Trek'' fan club, but <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says the location makes sense. `` Well, we live here, for one thing,'' he said. `` And <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> is one of the hottest markets for ` Star Trek' in the country. We can do just as good a job from <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> as we could from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. We do a lot of phone interviews and travel when we have to.'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> says their respective interests may eventually take them to new frontiers. `` We're looking at expanding into rock fan clubs and celebrity fan clubs,'' he says. <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON> says there may still be other prospects on the horizon. `` We're looking at films,'' he says. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> has considered writing for movies or episodic television, and I've always thought about being a director. We'd like to make our own movie eventually.'' <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON> says a genuine interest is what has made their efforts successful. `` Everything we've done so far was because we were fans of it. We're interested in what we're doing,'' he said. `` It is n't just a business.''

 Tall and powerful <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> seems right for the role as the tough federal agent in the forthcoming <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` Drug Wars: The Camarena Story.'' But <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> is equally at home doing comedy. He's also currently starring in the comedy series `` Coach,'' which <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> recently returned to its hit Tuesday schedule. `` Coach'' had previously aired in the spring and summer. In `` Coach,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, who at 45 clings to a coaching job in a small college that a younger man would regard only as a steppingstone. His old-fashioned ideas bring him into conflict with the women in his life, a coed daughter he had not seen in years, his longtime girlfriend and a new college president who has some feminist ideas about sports. Curiously enough, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> began as a stand-up comic and comedy writer-performer. But `` Coach'' is the first comedy he's done after years of dramatic roles in feature motion pictures, frequently as the heavy, and in such series as `` Chicago Story'' and `` Call To Glory.'' At one time, no producer would even consider him for a dramatic role. In 1972, he got so discouraged he packed up his family and moved into a log cabin with no electricity and no running water in a wilderness area. After five years, he hitchhiked back to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and found a company willing to back a documentary series on people who drop out of society. He tried to interest his former comedy partner, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, in helping him edit the series. Instead, he found <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> had just written a movie called `` ... And Justice For All.'' <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> asked him to audition for a role and he was cast as the calculating prosecutor. Suddenly, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> became a much sought-after actor for movies and television. After a time, people forgot he had done comedy. `` Drug Wars,'' which <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will broadcast in three parts Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, tells of the 1985 kidnap-murder of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and its aftermath. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents believe <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was killed with the knowledge of Mexican police and that a cover-up reached the top levels of the Mexican government. The story is based on the book `` Desperados'' by <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>. `` I play <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> ` </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON><PERSON> ' </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuykendall </PERSON>, the agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> office, although the name is changed to <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinmetz </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> says. `` He's a big Texan, soft-spoken, with a drawl. I talked with him several times because I needed to know how he reacted during certain situations. `` He was reaching into areas that were n't accessible to him and it was frustrating to him. In one scene he watches the police question one of the men who interrogated <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> after his abduction. He goes berserk because the questions are so absurd. <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> confirmed that it was a very difficult time and some punches were thrown.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s new show, `` Coach,'' began with a call from producer-creator <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. `` The idea of doing a comedy again really intrigued me,'' he says. `` People no longer thought of me as a comedy actor. I liked what <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> had in mind for the character. He's a guy in a midlife crisis. He's not necessarily a nice guy. As a coach, he has n't been exposed to a lot of other values. `` One of the things I liked is they wanted to bring him to a confrontation of his values and have him change through his daughter and girlfriend. The ladies in his life have certain ideas of how he should be adapting to what they bring him, but he does n't see it that way. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> in 1967 after he received a scholarship to the Oxford Theater from the <ORGANIZATION> Eddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cantor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` I had a baby and a wife and a car that was falling apart,'' he says. `` I met <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who was also on a scholarship. He was living in his car. It smelled like cologne and cigarettes. We teamed up and did a comedy act at various clubs and trade fairs. It was a way to get into the business, but at first I also had a job as a security guard and later as a security analyst.'' During that time they worked as writers and performers on a <PERSON> Lohman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON> television variety series, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Tim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hour </ORGANIZATION>,'' an <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> special and `` The John Byner Comedy Hour.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> has not written any `` Coach'' episodes, but says he has a lot of input. He is writing ideas for movies and other stories. `` I'm doing right now exactly what I want to be doing,'' he says.

 In the middle of the musical `` Grand Hotel,'' a young German baron suddenly declares his feelings for an older woman, a ballerina making the last of her many `` farewell'' tours. He sings a passionate love song that soars from the stage and over the audience. The singer is <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, one of a new generation of golden-voiced leading men making their mark on the Broadway musical this season. Among the others are <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, who plays a writer of 1940s detective novels, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>, who plays the writer's fictional creation in `` City of Angels''; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunton </PERSON>, who shaves beards and slits throats as the murderous barber in a revival of `` <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>,'' and <PERSON> Cris </PERSON> <PERSON> Groenendaal </PERSON>, now starring in the long-running but still sold-out `` Phantom of the Opera. In the tradition of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Raitt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullum </PERSON>, these men are performers who can act as well as sing. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> ranks among the best of them. `` Love Ca n't Happen,'' his big number in `` Grand Hotel,'' gets hearty applause. It's a smashing musical moment in a show that celebrates movement over music. Director and choreographer <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tune </PERSON> never lets the story stop in this adaptation of <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>'s novel about the goings-on in a luxury hotel in 1928 <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. And `` Grand Hotel'' may finally give the 39-year-old <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> the long Broadway run he deserves. It almost happened in 1988 when he played the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> grandmaster in `` Chess.'' The show had a glorious score but a short life in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, although <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> got a <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> nomination out of it. Most people remember `` Grand Hotel'' from the 1932 MGM movie, not the novel. The film starred <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrymore </PERSON> as the baron and <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> as the ballerina, but the motion picture is not what is on stage at <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> Theater. `` We're not doing the movie, especially where my part is concerned,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> was saying the other day. `` The baron is supposed to be much younger than the ballerina. In the book, it's beautifully written when he sees her fragility and the wrinkles on her face That's what we're playing. `` I saw the movie on TV the other night, and <PERSON> Barrymore </PERSON> looked to be in his 50s. And <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> looked younger than he was. But they were doing <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>'s version.'' Tune made sure everyone knew the novel. He gave everyone in the cast a copy of it before they began rehearsals. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> has been with the show from its first workshop production last year. The show rehearsed at the shabby Hotel Diplomat near the theater district. The hotel's once-splendid ballroom provided the right ambiance for rehearsals, and its architecture even inspired <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>'s set design. Tune, the man behind such musical hits as `` The Best Little Whorehouse in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' `` Nine'' and `` My One and Only,'' reworked the show extensively in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> before bringing it to Broadway in November. The book was revised, and <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeston </PERSON>, the composer of `` Nine,'' edited and augmented the original score by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON>. It was <PERSON> Yeston </PERSON> who wrote `` When Love Comes'' for the baron. `` This song came along and all of a sudden, it crystallized the two characters,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> says. `` The ballerina finally said, ` You're young.' And the baron finally said, ` I like older women.' It had n't been clear enough. I do n't think the audience could tell if I really like her or not. If I was trying to pull the wool over her eyes that would have made me an unsympathetic character.'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> has been stage-struck forever. `` My parents had a lot of show albums,'' he says. `` As newlyweds, they saw ` South Pacific' on a fluke about 11 days after it opened. It was played a lot around the house.'' Growing up on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> with two brothers and two sisters, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> always sang. `` We played the records and sang at the top of our lungs,'' he recalls. He also journeyed into <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to see musicals. `` I saw ` Oliver!' from the balcony and loved it. Of course, I wanted to be one of those kids right away. I went home and told my parents I was going to the High School of the Performing Arts like the kids on ` Wonderama' and that was it. But it did n't quite work out that way.'' <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> came first and detours into art and architecture. `` But I was spending so much time in the theater department that I said, ` Let's try it.''' Since he started to sing professionally in 1974, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> has worked in all kinds of musicals. `` Fortunately, when I came to town I found a voice teacher who I still have,'' he says. `` He taught me how to sing so I'll be able to sing until I'm 60.'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>'s resume is diverse. He has done a revival of `` Where's <PERSON> Charley </PERSON>? and a revue called `` <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>,'' and he sang opposite <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON> in a pop, English-language version of `` La Boheme.'' He has also had his share of short-lived shows such as `` Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,'' `` Oh, Brother!'' and `` Wind in the Willows.'' `` I always liked doing musicals, but I did n't want to be some stiff, musical comedy leading man who could n't dance and could n't act,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> says `` I like doing the whole thing.'' He got to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with the national tour of `` Deathtrap,'' starring <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedford </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> meant a lot of television movies playing roles such as <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertinelli </PERSON>'s husband or <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s boyfriend. But the parts were n't very challenging and the directors not inspiring. He came back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1983 and has n't left. `` I missed the theater and just realized I was more of a city person,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> says. `` Besides, the driving drove me nuts. I'm not a car person I do n't have one in the city now and get along just fine _ as long as I can crank out eight performances a week.''

 West Europeans are looking anxiously eastward as they plunge ahead with elaborate plans for the 1990s in a climate changing so quickly that answers are coming faster than questions. Their grand design is a `` single <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' of 12 Economic Community members starting at the end of 1992, a melting away of internal barriers and a blending of policies under the umbrella of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But after the Berlin Wall crumbled, and as a 44-year-old Iron Curtain buckles, everything from the pace of integration to the overall strategy has been thrown into doubt. Some Europeans suspect that against Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s image of a `` common European home,'' the smaller `` single <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' structure is a shaky house of cards. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is under mounting pressure to stand down in the face of former enemies who are now acting like friends. The official view, stressed at a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> summit at <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> in December, is that a united <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is crucial to helping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> leaders moved closer to a central bank, a common currency and uniform social benefits. They also agreed to set up a Bank of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to help newly democratic eastern neighbors. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> called for a flexibility yet to be defined, and most of its leaders applauded <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s plans to support a stronger <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> and to broaden <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> into a political forum for solving problems. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, speaking on a visit to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in December, suggested a greater dialogue with the East, not only on European problems but also to ease tensions elsewhere in the world. `` As <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> changes, the instruments for Western cooperation must adapt,'' he said. `` Working together, we must design and gradually put into place a new architecture for a new era.'' Whatever shape a new <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> takes, its leaders agree, the cornerstone will be <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In many ways, the divided nation has already united. Much hangs on how this union is formalized. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would grow from a reasonably sized <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> partner to a colossus of 80 million inhabitants with a gross national product of $ 1.4 trillion, approaching the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s. Without a separate <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> military alliance is reduced to a few satellites that are fast slipping away. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> insists that a re-united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would demilitarize <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and draw the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other Eastern European countries closer to the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>. But President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> maintains it is too early to predict the direction <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> now will take. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> clearly prefers separate Germanys while publicly supporting the Germans' right to settle the issue themselves. French leaders expect <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to block any formal reunification. Other <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> partners, while encouraging the lightning-fast changes, take a similar stance for varying reasons. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> fear investment and development funds they counted on will be diverted to the East. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> argues that postwar borders should remain intact. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which has resisted <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> monetary and social integration, may find an ally in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> anxious to preserve some independence within a single <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, after an emergency summit in November, made it plain that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was not anxious for a rapid blurring of East-West lines in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` All military matters must continue to be conducted through <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact,'' she said. `` At a time of great change, it's necessary to keep the background of stability and security.'' In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, reunification is already a dominant issue in general elections, still a year off. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has thrown open the door and encouraged investment to speed unification. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, West German officials already refer to `` the eastern part of the country.'' If <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s center-right coalition stays in power, it will have a mandate to push reunification. In such circumstances, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is likely to have reluctant support from <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, among others. In broad terms, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s mood is buoyant. The <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> estimates put growth at 2.7 percent for 1991, higher than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would like a share of that prosperity. Some officials say the Soviets now prefer trade to domination in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On Dec. 18, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> signed a 10-year trade pact, opening the way for a larger Western role in a changing Soviet economy. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> remarked: `` This is a result of a gigantic effort made by the peoples of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to overcome political and military confrontation, to overcome the economic division of our continent.'' In short, he said, `` the Cold War is over.''

 An aging, unpopular leadership, a faltering economy and a restive population make for an uncertain and troubled future as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> enters the last decade of the 20th century. Pessimists hold the field as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> emerges from one of the worst of many bad years under <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rule _ a year in which troops gunned down young demonstrators in the streets of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, long-nurtured ties with the West collapsed and a decade of economic reforms ground to a halt. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s goals for the end of the century, the quadrupling of national income compared to 1980, the smooth reversion of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and the triumphant staging of the Olympic games in the year 2000, are all suspended in doubt. The key question is how long <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can resist the storms of change that have swept through the communist autocracies of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Much depends on the health of the 85-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, the pragmatist who brought prosperity to millions of Chinese with his market-oriented reforms but who also represents the old revolutionaries using Stalinist repression to stifle popular dissent. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s chosen successor is <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, 63, a relative unknown who became head of the 48-million-member <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in June after reformist <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> was accused of supporting the pro-democracy movement and purged from all his party posts. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> party boss, is believed to favor economic reforms but, following the current line, has come across as a hardliner since taking office. He needs time to develop his weak political base and cultivate his political image, but if <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, believed to be in frail health, goes quickly, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> could face a rapid ride into oblivion. His rivals for power are ideological conservatives such as Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and octogenarian President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>. Their ascendancy would not mean a return to communes, backyard steel mills and international isolation. But it would accelerate the trend, already in progress, of re-emphasizing central planning, stifling private initiative and retreating on economic and political reforms. Their demand for unquestioning loyalty to the communist system and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rule also would put them on what many Chinese feel is an inevitable collision course with the forces of reform. The Tiananmen Square movement for a more democratic, open society, crushed by the military, is quiescent but is certain to re-emerge when the government lets down its guard. Events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have bolstered beliefs that the Chinese government can not forever resist popular demand for reform. <PERSON> Tiananmen </PERSON> also has clouded <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s future relationship with <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and complicated its long-term goal of reuniting with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, the Nationalist island. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has promised not to touch <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s capitalist system for 50 years after the British depart in 1997. But the nearly 6 million people of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> were badly shaken by the events of June, setting off a wave of emigrations among the colony's most talented people that is likely to continue until 1997. The rival Nationalist government on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in recent years has eased restrictions on trade with and visits to the mainland, raising <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s hopes of eventual reunification. But Tiananmen reinforced anti-Communist sentiments on the island and probably strengthened the growing movement for Taiwanese independence. Internationally, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s relations with the West will remain at a subnormal level as long as suppression of political dissent is an issue. That could spell bad news for the nation's economic planners, who badly need Western investment and technology to carry out the modernization drive. `` The bloom is off the rose,'' said one Western economist, who noted that Western businessmen will be inclined to spend their money in more politically palatable places like <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Investors are also concerned about the current government's backsliding on reforms and moves to re-establish the primacy of central planning, fixed pricing and party influence in the work place A retrenchment program, to continue at least until 1991, has had some success in cooling an overheated economy and bringing down inflation. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is seen by outside experts as being unable to compete with other rising economic powers such as <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> unless it pushes ahead with reforms, notably making prices correspond to market value. Economists see a possibility of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> becoming another <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, where high expectations for reform were followed by poor follow-through and years of dismal performance. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s leaders, trying to reassert state authority over the economy, also are likely to run into a growing trend of provincialism and regional rivalries fostered over the last decade when local powers were delegated greater autonomy. There is a real danger that the provinces, such as the prosperous southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> area near <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, will increasingly defy orders from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, with 1.1 billion people now, will have nearly 200 million more mouths to feed in the year 2000 and must substantially improve its stagnating agricultural output if it is to remain self-sufficient. The nation faces other staggering problems: _ Repayment of international debts of $ 44 billion reaches a peak period in the early 1990s and the government will be hard pressed to find the hard currency _ The education system is badly underfunded and little headway is being made in reducing an illiteracy rate of 20 percent, more than 200 million people _ The average annual income is less than $ 300 a person, the urban housing situation is abysmal and the welfare system surprisingly inadequate for a socialist country More than 20 percent of the labor force is said to be surplus or redundant and little is being done to prepare the nation for a serious unemployment problem. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in transition is a <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that will be struggling to resolve formidable contradictions,'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> said in a recent speech. `` It may be some years before we can put a name or theme to the new chapter <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will write in the 1990s. In the meantime, we must be prepared for twists and turns that may defy attempts to label as pragmatic or political, liberal or conservative, reform or retrogressive.''

 Efforts to end the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict and other disputes in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> are slow, but growing superpower detente could nudge the region toward greater stability in the 1990s. Iran-Iraq peace talks have stalled and both sides are rearming amid a widening proliferation of long-range missiles in the region. This is eroding <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s long-held technological superiority and heightening superpower concern of a new arms race, including nuclear and chemical weapons, in the volatile region. The pace of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace process is unlikely to gather momentum for some time, until <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right-wing prime minister, <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, relaxes his hardline position of refusing to negotiate with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Many observers believe this is unlikely unless there is intense pressure from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, at odds with a faction of his own <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as well as his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> partners </ORGANIZATION>, is in no position to start making concessions. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is expected to remain the crucial mediator between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, with whom it signed a peace treaty in 1979, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and other <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states in trying to reach a comprehensive <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace settlement. The current focal point of the peace process is a 10-point plan produced by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, designed to break the deadlock over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s blueprint for elections in the troubled occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, torn by a Palestinian uprising for the last two years. The main stumbling block is the Israeli government's refusal to negotiate with Palestinians they believe will speak for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, backed by the Arab League, insists there can be no peace conference not attended by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which Arabs acknowledge as the Palestinians' sole representative. Despite Israeli claims the uprising is foundering, it shows no sign of collapsing. The fear is that if there is no discernible progress in the peace process, it will intensify. Analysts believe <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, after publicly renouncing terrorism and recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, has gone as far down the road to moderation as he can without alienating the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s hardliners. A year-old dialogue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has failed to result in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> jarring any concessions from the Israelis. Failure to produce substantive results will leave <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> exposed and his peace initiative discredited from within the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Hardliners like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> of the Popular Front for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> have made clear their patience is running out. The <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace process, which has dragged on for more than 20 years with only <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s peace treaty to show for it, has a profound impact on the region's other conflicts. This is most pronounced in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'s proxy battleground, where the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> was finally jolted into taking forceful action to end 14 years of civil war. But the peace settlement it brokered has stalled because the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leader, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, rejects it, citing its failure to provide cast-iron guarantees of a Syrian withdrawal. The Syrians, their efforts to pacify their unruly neighbor thwarted yet again by Lebanese Christians, are becoming frustrated and may yet move against <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. Radical <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which needs <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as a security buffer between itself and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, is likely to come under pressure from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to moderate its stand on the overall <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement as detente improves. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, increasingly crucial to the peace process after years of being edged out by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is already seeking to persuade <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to abandon its drive for military parity with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Kremlin, increasingly concerned with economic and social upheaval at home, has made clear that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> must end its rifts with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to achieve the long-elusive <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unity that is a prerequisite for an international peace conference. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s ostensible ally, also is in transition following the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and the election of <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, leader of the so-called pragmatists, as president last summer. He seeks to open up <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after a decade of isolation, attract Western investment and technology to revitalize the moribund economy following the 1988 cease-fire in the 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. He is opposed by revolutionary hardliners and much will depend on whether he can fend off the challenge and ease economic hardships for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 55 million population, growing at an alarming 3.5 percent a year. If he can, one key consequence could be the release of Western hostages held by pro-Iranian militants in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the removal of a major source in instability in the region.

 At the dawn of a new decade, key <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> nations are growing economically stronger, pulled along by the mighty <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy is predicted to hum along at an annual growth rate close to 5 percent, the best among the big industrial democracies and the powerful engine helping other fast-growing economies like <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> _ the `` Little Dragons.'' The only real problem <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> faces as the 1990s begin is in the political realm. The governing, pro-business <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, beset by scandals and an unpopular tax, is heading for a crucial election, most likely in February. The Japanese electorate will have a chance to pass judgment on whether the cozy government-business relationship that has helped make <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> rich is too corrupt to continue. The result is hard to predict, though it seems likely that a political stalemate will harden, doing nothing to change <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar reputation for sterile politics. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Little Dragons harnessed well-educated, dedicated work forces to the aim of exporting, with the huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market as the target. Their success, however, has finally stung the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> giant into demanding reciprocal export markets. The old formula for economic success in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> thus is in question, and countries are increasingly looking to each other as markets. With <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s backing and initial membership, a conference of <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> nations was held in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in 1989 to improve economic coordination. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s overall trade surplus has declined but the troublesome surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seems stuck around $ 50 billion a year. American demands for quality Japanese consumer products, machinery and high-tech gear are unlikely to abate. Trade negotiators will be busy for the foreseeable future as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> seeks greater sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s market. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategy now is to change fundamental ways of doing business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials can expect tough slogging. Traveling right behind the negotiators are businessmen from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ and many other countries _ seeking niches in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s lucrative market. Other countries in the region will be similar targets of the international businessman, and, like <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the explorer will find in them vibrant local markets and complex political situations. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, for instance: the British colony is to revert to Chinese rule in 1997, and the question now is how many of the 5.6 million people will still be in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> then. The colony's morale slumped in June when the Chinese army stamped out the pro-democracy movement, and the future of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> depends on developments in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> casts a shadow over other Far Eastern economies. It had become a key source of cheap labor and land for businesses searching for lower overhead costs. The stunning political repression in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> set back many plans for investment in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. While <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> moved forward with democratic political reforms, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' young democracy took a heavy shock in December with a bloody military coup attempt. The mutineers probably shot as many holes in the country's chances for strong economic growth as they shot in the high-rises of the <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> where the coup sputtered out.

 The idyllic <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> saw its first coups, political violence and secessionist battles in the 1980s. But in the decade ahead, the `` Century of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>'' beckons and the island states expect to have a small but assertive voice in the world. Speaking in unison across a vast expanse of water will be the voices of a new generation of post-colonial leaders with intractible problems: malnutrition, fragile economies with scant export prospects and urban unemployment brought on by villagers flocking to towns with increased expectations. `` One of the continuing difficulties of the small island states is that many will remain dependent on foreign aid, and in some respects more in the past as they continue to grapple with these problems,'' said an Australian government offiical. The decade of the 1980s saw unprecented turmoil in the region. <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> had two racially inspired military coups. Civil lawlessness in <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> claimed more than 50 lives. The capitals of <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION> suffered destructive rioting. Hostage-taking in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> triggered a bloody French assault. Added to that was a perceived Soviet military threat to the region, concern about <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s growing economic inroads and anxiety that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was making a foothold in an area better known for its tranquility and palm-fringed lagoons than as a political hothouse. Covering 22 percent of the world's surface, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> is home to 5 million people, excluding <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. Environmental problems like depletion of the ozone layer over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> and the Earth's global warming has caused serious concern in a region of low-lying atolls that could be swamped by seas swollen by melting polar ice. The future of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> is assured a big debate as countries like <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> push for protected wilderness status against others who view the world's last great wilderness as a minerals treasure house. `` If for nothing else, that will happen because of the sheer importance of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> in regard to the world's weather patterns,'' said the Australian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Driftnet fishing _ the casting of huge nets over a large area of the sea to scoop up tons of fish at once _ was a problem virtually unheard of six months ago. But it moved into world forums after island governments banded together to draw up an international convention and propose <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions that forced <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to scale down the practice. The 1980s gave birth to an anti-nuclear <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and the declaration of a South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone adopted by 15 island states. `` They are increasingly becoming very effective in articulating their point of view and building up cooperation among member states, `` said the Australian official. `` It is a small, but growing voice helped by a new generation of more assertive leaders.'' Against that, he said, `` There are no new bonanzas looming that are going to provide them with any riches.'' The concept of the `` Century of the Pacific'' took a first, tentative step in 1989 when 12 major <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, met in <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, to plan the future. They agreed to meet again in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> in early 1990 and probably again in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, later in the year to plan an Asian-Pacific cooperative venture, an idea all agreed was one `` whose time has come.'' The <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> meeting brought together <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> with his counterparts from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. They represented 1.9 billion people and $ 280 billion in trans-Pacific trade, 50 percent more than trans-Atlantic trade. The meeting was described by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials as the most important economic initiative in 50 years.

 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> _ a swath of turbulence through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> _ enter the 1990s still trying to sort out their individual and overlapping destinies. Each of the four nations is on the threshhold of change, teetering between the possibility for passable stability and the specter of more chaos, political, military or both. The most dramatic conflagrations are the two wars anchoring each end of this geographical arc that begins at <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and ends in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> off southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s civil war through the 1980s was a proxy battlefield for the ideological war and balance of power between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. With the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal in early 1989, the superpower involvement is less overt but not yet over In contrast, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s tangle of ethnic and political killing is one of those messy and obscure wars that have little bearing on the affairs of other nations. For <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the coming decade offers a testing ground for democracy and a chance to continue the thaw of hostilities that took them to war three times in the past. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s case, both the concept and practice of democracy have been entrenched since independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. But the derailment of the Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in November's elections has given Indians the opportunity to prove their democracy has truly come of age. As new Prime Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> contends with his implausible coalition of Hindu right-wingers, secular centrists and increasingly anachronistic communists, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> will discover whether it can find enduring leadership outside the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dynasty of prime ministers that began with <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s grandfather, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, and, except for brief hiccoughs, passed on to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> In his first few days of office, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> took encouraging steps toward resolving the separatist Sikh revolt in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and now must capitalize on them. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which also became independent in 1947, when it was carved out of British <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to give Moslems a nation separate from the Hindus, democracy has had a far more spasmodic and difficult birth. Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who attained office through the ballot box in 1988 after the death of the coup-installed president, Gen. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, must tread carefully. Her government supplanted 11 years of military rule but is still juggling an array of threats. Moslem fundamentalists reject the very idea of a woman heading a government. Less dogmatic politicians simply want their chance to grasp power. And although the armed forces may have retreated from the front lines of political office-holding, they are unwilling to relinquish their not-so-behind-the-scenes power. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, the ex-secret police chief who with Soviet backing muscled aside an even harsher <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> protege in 1986, has proved an adept player of the Afghan game. But he is only a survivor, not a victor. Ostensibly, his chief enemies are the mujahedeen, the fractured alliance of Moslem guerrillas armed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> must also contend with the power-hungry opponents within his own People's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. As Communist Party power delines in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> so, too, could it subside in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, whose tribal society has never been fertile ground for either Marxism or centralized government. The Soviets continue to supply and coach <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to aid the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, through its ally, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the region's strongest military power, is still embroiled in a border dispute with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>. On the Indian side of the contested frontier, increasingly violent Moslem militants want <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> to join <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> or become independent. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> also must re-assess the role of regional policeman it eagerly embraced in the late 1980s when it sent troops to the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to thwart a coup and to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to try to halt internal strife between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority. The Maldivian deployment was a success, but <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> had mixed success as a peacemaker in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and is now pledging a speedy end to its 2 -LCB- - year military adventure Indian intervention set in motion the long-overdue but still incomplete formula to help Tamils wrest more political power from the Sinhalese-controlled central government. But this foreign-inspired political pact, coupled with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s bulldozer approach to peacekeeping, touched off even greater violence by popping the cork on a bottle full of evil genies Tamils and Sinhalese rarely fight each other any more. Instead, Tamils are killing Tamils and Sinhalese are killing Sinhalese in fights for dominance within each ethnic community. Still, the 1990s offer <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> the chance _ perhaps its last _ to climb out of anarchy before the skeleton of democracy succumbs to the flames of war.

 Having struggled through `` a lost decade'' of crushing debt and economic stagnation, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> limps into the 1990s with the grim prospect of more tough times. Its many young democracies still fight to establish firm roots in troubled societies, inherited in many cases from now-retired military governments. At the same time, they face the daunting challenge of halting a continental slide deeper into underdevelopment. The 1980s began with what is now generically known as `` the crisis'' _ plunging prices for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s products accompanied by skyrocketing foreign debts. The decade ended with those debts approaching $ 300 billion overall, with surreal inflation averaging nearly 1,000 percent a year, with spreading poverty and with widespread social unrest. At the close of the decade, per capita production was 8 percent less than it was at the start. The troubles struck not only in countries with a tradition of political and social commotion such as <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Even long-steady <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> was jolted by price riots in 1989. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, another economic and political stalwart, waged bloody war with a billion-dollar cocaine underworld that was deeply entrenched in several other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries. The experts see few signs of a better decade ahead. `` As far as perspectives for the 1990s, there is a certain temptation to predict that the crisis will continue,'' said <PERSON> Gert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. In an interview in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said there were grounds for pessimism in the inertia of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s deep and long-lasting recession, which has prompted him to call the 1980s `` a lost decade.'' He said he also harbored `` the suspicion that the prolonged expansion of world development ca n't last much longer, and any recession in the international economy surely will hit <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> very hard.'' In addition, he noted, there's little prospect of badly needed fresh credit for the debtor countries trying to refinance loans that drain the region each year of $ 30 billion, money that could be put to use at home. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> cited several positive developments that could help in coping with the future. He said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> learned a hard lesson in the 1980s: Its archaic economies, run by creaky state bureaucracies, must be overhauled if it is to compete in the world marketplace. Also, he said, both creditor banks and debtor countries were adopting ever-more flexible positions on foreign debts. He also cited a certain `` revitalization'' of the old, battered concept of Latin American cooperation and integration. The 1980s began with nine of the continent's 12 countries controlled by authoritarian military governments. The decade ends with elected leaders governing all but in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, where elections in December set the stage for the first civilian government since 1973. Few of those new civilian governments have shown any success in solving economic problems, but none has yet to fall. Indeed, while particular governments have sometimes suffered from slumping popular support, surveys indicate little inclination for the return of military rule. Periodic uprisings at Argentine garrisons have been quickly snuffed. `` Despite the entire decade's critical economic situation, it appears clear that the democratic regimes are becoming consolidated in the principal countries,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, director of the independent <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is no reason to believe the -LRB- democratic -RRB- processes will be interrupted in the foreseeable future,'' <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> said. `` Even where the situation is most precarious, such as <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, the institutional machine keeps working despite everything.'' The wave of democracy has produced a spirit of fellowship and cooperation reflected in numerous summit meetings among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations, involving as many as a half-dozen presidents. <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> said a new political and economic coherence is emerging. `` Everyone sees the need for relatively pragmatic programs, aimed at economic restructuring,'' he said. `` No one is turning to ideological alternatives. There is no South American wave in favor of socialism, for instance.'' In deeply indebted <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, a pro-business conservative, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, edged out a socialist, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, in presidential elections Dec. 17. <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> said deep ideological divisions and animosities that often fractured <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> societies are being erased. `` The range of possibilities has become so narrow, it's obliging everyone to be pragmatic,'' he said.

 The <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, which comprises some of the world's poorest and most heavily indebted nations, faces the prospect of increasing economic and social pressures in the 1990s. Problems confronting the two dozen island states south of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> range from rising unemployment and shrinking markets for sugar and bananas to the spread of AIDS and drug trafficking. Some analysts believe the strain could be severe enough to produce a resurgence of radical politics and civil unrest. `` There is just no way for stable democracy to continue in these islands unless more jobs and income are generated,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, adviser on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> for Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. While celebrating the 500th anniversary of <PERSON> Colombus </PERSON>' discovery of the New World in 1992, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> will likely find itself still coping with the effects of events dictated far from its shores. <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> leaders have expressed concern, for example, that the Cold War thaw could divert Western investment from their region to the nations emerging from communist domination in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Likewise, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> could be forced to reduce its economic dependence on the Soviet bloc, said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Girvan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION>. `` What's happening in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is changing our external environment,'' he said. `` What's happening in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> must change the environment of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' For much of the region, one of the darkest clouds on the horizon is the proposed single European market after 1992. A unified market would lift trade barriers within the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and harmonize foreign trade agreements. Among the nations most at risk are the <LOCATION> Windward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, which together ship 240,000 tons of bananas a year to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. After 1992, they could lose preferential access to the British market and face fierce competition from more efficient banana producers elsewhere. Many also fear the loss of benefits as a result of the new U.S.-Canadian trade accord and proposed changes in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> Initiative, the program set up by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to promote U.S.-oriented economic and political development in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The next decade is going to test the very theory that microstates can survive in a world increasingly dominated by massive trading blocs,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Birns </PERSON>, director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs. Propects for the sugar industry, meanwhile, are dimmed by years of sharply declining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> import quotas, low world prices and increasing reliance on corn sweeteners and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European sugar beets. <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON>, professor of economics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, said he thought pressure would build on <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> governments to follow through on commitments to integrate their economies and pool limited resources. But he said propects for the 1990s largely depended on the willingness of developed nations to reduce the region's debt burden and provide sorely needed investment. Analysts said the expected loss of revenue from traditional exports would probably accelerate a move into tourism, already the No. 1 earner of foreign exchange for several islands, and enhance such industries as computer data entry that use cheap, semi-skilled labor. <PERSON> Birns </PERSON> said there was a danger that environmental considerations will be overwhelmed by the rush to exploit the islands' lucrative tourism potential. Tourism is also regarded as a significant factor in the rapid spread of AIDS, prostitution and drug use throughout the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Although conservative, pro-U.S. governments dominate the region, <PERSON> Birns </PERSON> said, `` the approaching crisis'' could give rise to radically leftist leadership and possible destabilization. If Western lending institutions such as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> force further economic austerity on such debt-ridden nations as <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, `` you're going to see an increasingly dangerous situation,'' <PERSON> Birns </PERSON> said. He added that the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> of the 1990s would figure more prominently in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy because of increased immigration and closer scrutiny of the region's role as a major drug-trafficking route and source of money-laundering through offshore banks. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>'s perennial trouble spot, approaches the new decade at a political crossroads. Opinion is divided over whether <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s military leader, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, will fulfill his pledge to turn over power to a civilian government in elections scheduled for the fall of 1990. No one expects a swift solution to the country's profound economic problems.

<TEXT>
 Bedeviled by wars, corruption, mismanagement and a burgeoning population, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is ending a decade of economic decline and facing what some experts say could be a `` nightmare scenario'' in the 1990s. The nightmare: increased hunger, disease, poverty and conflict on a continent already desperately poor and largely unable to survive on its own without huge doses of foreign aid. While warning of possible new violence elsewhere, many observers predict an end to war in the coming decade in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and other embattled African countries as combatants fight to stalemate and exhaustion. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> ended the 1980s with an election for a constitutional assembly and will enter the world of independent nations in the coming year. Peace also seems close at hand in neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. White-ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has long meddled in both those countries, appears to be changing its racial policies, albeit too slowly for some. But, with the exception of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the possibility of greater stability in those countries will not automatically bring prosperity to them or to the vast continent as a whole, say economists for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and other institutions. The 46 countries of sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ a region of 450 million people that includes all of the continent's nations except <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ had a combined gross domestic product in 1987 of about $ 135 billion. That was about the same as <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, with a population of only 10 million. That comparison, as well as any, illustrates the depths of poverty from which most African nations are struggling to emerge, only, in many cases, to slip deeper and deeperinto debt and deprivation. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, in a study that took nearly three years to complete and was released in late November, says there is a solution for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ one that depends largely on Africans themselves and calls for a sharp reversal of past practices. The bank, a leading multinational lending institution, blames many of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s problems on corruption, poor government marked by bureaucratic bungling and misguided economic practices rooted in Marxist-Leninist theory. All that, it said, must end. It was perhaps the bluntest assessment the bank has ever made of any of the world's economies, but it may have been far easier and faster to write than the suggested changes will be coming to a continent whose rulers have too often equated power with plunder. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and others have also stressed the need for a sharp reduction in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s birth rate. At 3.2 percent it is the highest ever seen anywhere in the world and one that inexorably accelerates pressures for land, food and jobs and threatens new internal and cross-border conflicts. The population of sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1965 was only half the 450 million it is now and if current trends continue it will double again to 1 billion in 20 years. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> estimates that even if fertility fell tomorrow to two children for each African family, the continent's population would continue to grow for the next 60 to 70 years. `` No region of the world has ever managed to develop with so high a rate of population growth,'' the bank said. Even in those countries where peace has arrived or is on the horizon, it is likely to take most of the new decade to revive their war-shattered economies, given optimum circumstances. Some have fallen not just 10 years behind in the development process, but 20 or 30. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s prescription for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> called for increased aid of about 4 percent a year through the 1990s from the developed nations. But many African politicians and planners worry that the East European countries emerging from behind the Iron Curtain _ <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and possibly others _ will siphon off aid dollars as they attempt to restructure their economies with Western help. As if those problems were n't enough, a new peril arose in the 1980s that threatens <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the coming years with a catastrophe comparable to the droughts and famines that periodically sweep the continent. It is AIDS. Health authorities estimate that 1.5 million to 2 million Africans, mostly young adults, will die of AIDS in the 1990s, draining even further the continent's already shallow pool of skilled workers and forcing many countries to spend more scarce money on medical services.

 It's a curious irony that the leading commercial filmmaker of the cynical 1980s is a devout romantic. Throughout his career, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> has taken a sunshiny view of the human situation. His heroes, notably <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, always triumph over insuperable odds. Life may hold its miseries, as in `` The Color Purple,'' but the struggle is always worth it in the long run. Even <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s space visitors -LRB- `` Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' `` E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial'' -RRB- prove benign. `` Always'' is <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s most romantic film yet. The new movie stems from his fondness for the happy-ending films of the 1940s, especially `` A Guy Named <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>.'' That film provides the basis for `` Always,'' which is not likely to win the hearts of hardbitten critics but should appeal to the millions who embraced `` Field of Dreams'' early in 1989. In the new version, the air war of World War II has been supplanted by the battle against devastating forest fires. The sense of jeopardy is not the same, hence the dramatic tension is diminished. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> is the hotshot pilot of the tanker bomber base, taking risks that alarm his sweetheart, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, an air controller. He believes he is invincible, but during a daring rescue of his buddy, played by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, his plane explodes. <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> finds himself on a grassy oasis amid a burned-out forest, getting instructions from an angel _ <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> in a white designer pantsuit. The guardian angel tells <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> his mission: to return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> unseen and help <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> overcome her grief and pass on his flying prowess to another pilot. Enter <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a klutzy flier who needs <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON>' help but is handsome enough to sway <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s heart <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> lavishes all his craft on `` Always,'' and no director makes better use of the camera. The fire scenes have a frightening immediacy, and the flying is among the best in recent times. The fault lies in the script, credited to <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Belson </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> but seemingly the work of many hands. Consistency of tone is lacking, and the plot has certain confusions, as though important scenes had been cut. The cast performs admirably. <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> displays the solidity of <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, who originated the role. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> is highly effective, especially after she drops her down-home cuteness. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> neatly fits his large frame into the <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond-Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> kinds of roles. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has the looks of a'40s screen idol and is likely to become a star of the'90s. `` Always'' is a Universal-United Artists picture produced by <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The rating is PG, probably for mild swearing and excitement. Running time: 121 minutes.

 `` Forbidden Sun'' -LRB- Academy Entertainment. VHS-Beta, $ 79.95. Rated R -RRB- <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> plays a former Olympic athlete who runs a summer school for girl gymnasts on the island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>. Among her pupils is <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, a juvenile delinquent who wants to emulate the ancients Greeks and vault over the horns of a live bull. When one of the girls is raped, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> uses a variation of the `` bull dance'' to get revenge. Uh huh, this film is as lame as it sounds. The suspense lasts about as long as a skip across the balance beam. The payoff at the end is meager. Filled with references to arson, bulls, rape and young women, `` Forbidden Sun'' undoubtedly has some kind of psychosexual subtext, but do n't waste your time trying to find it.

 `` Great Balls of Fire'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. VHS-Beta, $ 89.98. Rated PG-13 -RRB- Some of the best movie biographies are films such as `` Lawrence of Arabia,'' `` Gandhi'' and `` Raging Bull,'' all carefully researched and written and based on a variety of sources. And with such standard-bearers, why does <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> continue to seek out books, usually best sellers, that give only a fragmented -LRB- and sometimes biased -RRB- account of an event or life, and rush to make movies of them? Are the creative minds of the film industry incapable of doing original research and stories? These questions come to mind with `` Great Balls of Fire,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>'s movie on the life and times of the piano-pumping rocker <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, based on the book by <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> with <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>. <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Baran </PERSON> did the screenplay. The movie is a kinetic romp through the early years of rock' n' roll, when <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> was King and pretenders like <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> threatened to topple him The music is non-stop fun, whether songs by Presley and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, or <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Autry </PERSON> singing `` Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer'' or <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> `` Baby'' <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> stomping through `` Happy Organ.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON> is a treat as <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. He's manic, lewd, adorable and crazy. He swaggers about with childish abandon, and dances with the piano like a careless lover. At times, though, <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON> becomes almost cartoonish in his portrayal. But that's OK, because <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was a walking comic book. <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Winona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- was <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s third wife. She also was his third cousin and 13 years old when they married. He was 22. Ryder -LRB- `` Heathers'' -RRB- continues to impress with her film work. She is a great casting choice for the pubescent, pulchritudinous bubble gum-chewing <PERSON> Myra </PERSON>. She is wide-eyed and dreamy-eyed, giggly and pouty, lusty and innocent. Their wedding scene is a wonderful slice of life. Ryder stares blankly at the justice of the peace, mouth ajar like he's the purple people eater. Later, at the dinner table with her parents, she bursts into giggles knowing that she's married and they have n't a clue The year was 1958, and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had already shot to the top of the charts with `` Whole <PERSON> Lotta </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakin </PERSON>' Goin' On'' and `` Great Balls of Fire.'' But his marriage to <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> shocked a staid post-war public, and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' career crumbled. The movie is centered on <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s relationship -LRB- it should have been titled `` <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> and Myra'' -RRB- and abruptly ends with the birth of their son, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who drowned in a swimming pool when he was 3. The late <PERSON> Trey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> co-stars as <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> launched Presley and others. <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> is deliciously self-righteous as <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' cousin and boyhood buddy, TV evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> `` Great Balls of Fire'' is a harmless piece of entertainment for a Saturday afternoon. It's fun to watch, especially <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON>'s gymnastics and clownish grimaces But the movie lacks authenticity; it seems to be laughing at itself and at the era it purports to chronicle. There's also an element of racism. A scene at a black nightspot, for example, depicts black patrons as lewd animals doing bumps and grinds, and crawling over each other in the most suggestive ways.

 `` Louder Than Love'' -LRB- A & amp; M -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Soundgarden </LOCATION> The future of heavy metal is here and its name is <LOCATION> Soundgarden </LOCATION>. On `` Louder Than Love,'' its debut album for a major label, the Seattle-based quartet has stripped the genre down to its bare-knuckled essentials _ loud guitar, shrieking vocals and crashing drums. It's loud, but it is by no means just noise. The Parents Music Resource Center obviously broke out in a cold sweat over the repetition of `` gon na kill your mother'' in the cynical `` Hands All Over,'' hence the album's warning sticker. But the <ORGANIZATION> PMRC </ORGANIZATION> did n't bother to read a little deeper into the lyrics, which are really a commentary on the destruction of the environment: The `` mother'' becomes <LOCATION> Mother </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Soundgarden </LOCATION> responds, though, when lead singer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON> sings: `` Hands all over words I utter _ Change them into what you want to _ Like balls of clay.'' And yes, obscenities are chanted about a zillion times in `` Big Dumb Sex,'' but that's the point _ the song is a wicked, Spinal Tap-ish blast at all the big dumb sex songs floating around the radio. It seems as if <LOCATION> Soundgarden </LOCATION> figured that everyone else beats around the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> about sex in their songs, so we might as well say exactly what our intentions are. On tracks such as `` Gun'' and `` Power Trip,'' the band points out the problems that arise when power surfaces in violence and exploitation. The biting `` I Awake'' looks at an abusive relationship from the viewpoint of the abuser. <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> sings: `` You have a good day _ It's not your fault _ I know it hurts.'' The real kicker comes in the repeated line, `` Remember I love you.'' <LOCATION> Soundgarden </LOCATION> follows the path blazed by <PERSON> Metallica </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Addiction in reminding listeners that we do n't live in a pretty world It's a shame that their music, like that of <PERSON> Metallica </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Addiction, will probably make the radio waves. _ By <PERSON> Kira </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billik </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` In the Land of Salvation and Sin'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Elektra </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Satellites Give the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellites </ORGANIZATION> credit for candor _ they make no attempt to camouflage their many influences. The liner notes for `` In the Land of Salvation and Sin'' salute, among others, <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the Replacements and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> and the Heartbreakers. The songs recall, among others, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> -LRB- `` Bottle O' Tears'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Lynyrd </PERSON> <PERSON> Skynyrd </PERSON> -LRB- `` All Over But the Cryin''' -RRB- and the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- `` Stellazine Blues'' -RRB-. There's nothing wrong with a few borrowed riffs when they're well used, and `` Salvation and Sin'' is a solid set It sounds like a tight bar band on a good night. Lead songwriter <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, while not terribly original, nonetheless has talent. His two ballads, `` Another Chance'' and `` Sweet Blue Midnight,'' are particularly appealing. The former is about growing older -LRB- `` Do n't want to die asking for another chance'' -RRB-; the latter, with <PERSON> Nicolette </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> providing lovely harmony vocals, concerns the search for comfort amid life's uncertainties Most of <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>'s uptempo tunes work, too, with drummer <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Magellan </PERSON> and bassist <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> usually able to find a groove. The Georgia Satellites' potential likely is limited because of <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>'s singing and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' slide guitar _ both are nondescript performers. But <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>'s songwriting and the band's ability to distill their diverse influences make `` Salvation and Sin'' worth a listen _ By <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Jessica Lange Meets Costa-Gavras</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``The Music Box'' opened in New York and Los Angeles on Dec.
22.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The combination of a volatile star and a director of international renown might seem potentially explosive. But <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> and <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON> claim the expected fireworks did n't happen in their collaboration on `` Music Box.'' After her disastrous debut in `` King Kong,'' <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> began taking charge of her career. She has reportedly clashed with directors over interpretations of her film roles and has developed and produced her own projects, such as `` Country.'' <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON> is known as the uncompromising, Greek-born director of such politically-themed films as `` Z,'' `` Missing'' and `` Betrayed.'' `` Music Box'' deals with guilt from the Holocaust. `` I had input as far as the development of the character,'' says the actress, who plays a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer defending her father against charges he murdered Jews in his native <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` I was n't involved at a production level. I had such respect and confidence in Costa that I did n't feel the need to get in there and make my opinions known. I agreed with what he was doing, which made the filmmaking much easier for me. It's difficult when you're not in agreement with how the film is being made You have to expend a lot of energy arguing or opposing the way things are happening. `` In this case, everybody was in sync. But it's rare.'' `` She is strong, and extremely nice,'' <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON> said about his star. `` It was a big pleasure, because the relationship -LRB- developed -RRB- little by little, getting very close as we spoke about the character in a very intimate way. I think it was quite a unique experience to me. She looks a little distant, but she's absolutely not.'' In one of her infrequent interviews, <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> was asked if she encountered any resentment because a star insisted on making her opinions known. She laughed and replied, `` I suppose there was some of that. I'm certainly not the first person to do that, and I wo n't be the last Sometimes you're just an actress for hire: You go in and do your part and that's it. At other times your commitment is deeper than that.'' <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> approached her `` Music Box'' role with her usual thoroughness, hanging out in courtrooms and reading endless legal briefs. `` Ultimately, you can observe behavior,'' she said, `` but when you get down to playing it, it all has to come from the character. `` But I learned a lot about legal proceedings. It's a very tricky business. ... One thing I learned about law is that it's not synonymous with truth. They do not exist side-by-side, which is too bad, because originally I think that's what it was meant to be. Now so much of it is rhetoric, tricks and manipulation.'' The 40-year-old <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> reigns as one of the five most-in-demand film actresses, a position no one would have predicted 10 years ago. After repeating the <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wray </PERSON> role in `` King <PERSON> Kong </PERSON>,'' she did n't work for two years Finally, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosse </PERSON> gave her a small part as an angel in `` All That Jazz.'' Although the remake of `` The Postman Always Rings Twice'' with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> was a failure, <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> was impressive as a dramatic actress. That promise was fulfilled in `` Tootsie,'' `` Frances,'' `` Sweet Dreams'' and `` Country,'' all resulting in Academy nominations. She won the 1982 <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> as supporting actress for `` Tootsie.'' Her acting dreams began as a child in rural <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, where she fell in love with `` Gone With the Wind'' and played <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON>'s death scene with every sickness. `` From the time I was 9, I was obsessed with ` Gone With the Wind,''' she confessed. `` It was an obsession that lasted until I saw the French film, ` Children of Paradise.' Then my obsession switched. These two films got me through childhood and adolescence, all the way up into my 20s.'' <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> is intensely private, but she has provided the gossip writers with plenty of copy. Her liaison with dancer <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> produced a daughter, <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, 7. She and playwright-actor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> are parents of <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, born in 1986, and <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, born in 1987. She and <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, who are not married, make their home in rural <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` The farm is great, but every once in a while you want the bright lights, big city,'' she remarked. `` The trick is to find an equilibrium.'' `` Music Box'' was partly filmed in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> before the recent political upheavals. `` You could feel there was something in the air when we were there in the spring,'' the actress said. `` There was definitely a change beginning to happen; you could tell from the spirit of the people. I had never been to an Eastern bloc country before, so it was real interesting to me. I was real relieved to get home, though.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Santa Fe Folk Art Will Become Enduring Classic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED MORENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Real adobe bricks and mud are rarely used these days to build houses, and even the supply of real cornhusks to wrap homemade tamales is drying up. Nowadays, plaster stucco gives that adobe look and restaurants wrap tamales in paper. Even popular forms of folk art, such as the ubiquitous howling coyote, are mass-produced in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It has become increasingly difficult to distinguish authentic <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> art from imitation. But rather than diluting the genre, those who help define <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> style believe <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s unique amalgamation of Indian, Hispanic and Anglo-European cultures will sustain its popularity long after the fad has faded. `` People talk about the fad aspect, but the fact remains that <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> style is rooted in centuries of human history,'' says <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON>, co-author of the book, `` Santa Fe Style.'' That's good news for the thousands who came this Christmas season in search of a wreath of red chili peppers, a classy poster from a famous Southwestern or Indian artist or simply to experience Christmas Eve singing Christmas carols around a pinon bonfire on Delgado Street. It means that <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe style, its architecture, simplicity and warmth, will never go completely out of style. `` I do n't think it will ever die,'' says <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cawley </PERSON>, an art wholesaler with a gallery on fashionable <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. If anything, its popularity is expanding. With sales of more than 100,000 copies, <PERSON> Mather </PERSON>'s book has helped put <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe style into the American vernacular. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradbury </PERSON>, who operates a <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> tour service, says this Christmas season seems busier than ever. <PERSON> Cawley </PERSON>'s art business is growing on every continent. The style emerged from the traditions, practices and architecture of the Pueblo Indians, with their heavy, asymmetrical, multi-story homes, and the Spanish, who brought European religious traditions to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the 1500s. Popularized by a colony of artists in the 1920s and'30s, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> culture is reflected in simple, comfortable clothing, turquoise and silver jewelry and honest, spicy cuisine, along with an affinity for dirt streets, tolerance of the eccentric, appreciation of a stunning blue sky and, in some quarters, almost paranoid defense of the fine and folk arts. The most enduring features of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> look will be its building styles, which some experts believe will join the gallery of classic historic and architectural styles such as colonial American, Victorian and Old South. The decision to copy <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> mission style and establish and foster a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> architectural movement was made early in the 1900s when it became apparent that the city, relegated to the end of a spur off the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Railroad </LOCATION> main line, would never again be a major trading center. Community leaders adopted what architectural historian <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> calls Spanish pueblo revival style, and passed the city's first historic styles ordinance, which has remained relatively intact Its characteristics are typified by the heavy, low-profile Palace of the Governors and the state <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> facing the central plaza, renovated soon after statehood in 1912. The latest wave of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe popularity began more than a decade ago, at about the same time northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> artisans began producing small, carved animal figures, including howling coyotes. The coyote has mythical meaning to many Indian tribes, sometimes creator and benefactor, often mischief-maker and destroyer. More than that, it has a distinctive image that is simple, decorative and affordable, says gallery owner <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON>. Mather, husband of the author, began featuring the carvings of several local artisans in 1978. Now the work of <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Archuleta </PERSON> and a half-dozen others resides in museum collections. On display at <ORGANIZATION> Mather </ORGANIZATION>'s gallery is the next fad: carved, wooden, painted, wall-hanging snakes. The carved coyotes, snakes and their knock-offs and reproductions on T-shirts, pottery and canvas are not universally popular among some <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> residents who say they trivialize the value of their town. `` It's stupid. There are coyotes everywhere,'' says artist <PERSON> Corri </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>. `` Somebody said it would peak next month, but I doubt it.'' Cartoonist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Milord </PERSON> has lampooned the excesses and capitalized on the local pique with a colorful hit poster entitled `` Another Victim of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe Style.'' The poster is set in a classic, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe-style </LOCATION> room, with beamed ceilings, a kiva or beehive fireplace with stucco benches and a niche with a small santo -LRB- wooden figure representing a saint -RRB- inside. Against the walls are a carved wooden trastero -LRB- hutch -RRB-, a chili ristra, a buffalo skull and carved, painted snakes against the walls. A howling coyote and leather drum rest on the Mexican tile floor. A woman, lying supine on a woven <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> rug, is decked out in turquoise squash blossom necklaces and silver concha belts, wearing a velvet shirt and pleated skirt and cowboy boots. A painted snake, which appears to have wriggled off the wall and bitten its owner, slithers out the door. `` The people who buy them are, like, laughing at themselves,'' says <PERSON> Milord </PERSON>. `` It's not a mean thing.'' An old, classy town such as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, which has withstood conquests, revolts, reconquests and immigration of all varieties, may see the coyote fade from popularity, knowing it will likely return. Twenty to 30 years from now, <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> predicts, a clever <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Fean </PERSON> will dig into his trunk and emerge with paper napkins emblazoned with a bandana-scarfed coyote, its mouth pointed upward howling at the moon. It will begin yet another revival _ of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> kitsch.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Let's Sing the Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sting did it. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON> did it. Even <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> did it. So, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchester </PERSON> reasoned, let's do it, let's sing standards. `` This music has been out in the universe for decades,'' said <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, whose first album in four years, `` Tribute,'' includes `` Stardust,'' `` Over the Rainbow'' and other lushly produced songs from the pre-rock' n' roll era. `` These are magnificent melodies and long, intricate stories. To wrap your voice around them makes you want to rise to the occasion of these songs. It's different than singing short bits of rock' n' roll phrases, which I find more difficult. In 1985, <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> had had enough. A dozen years of making records had erased the thrill. There were children to raise, an interest in theater to pursue. It seemed a good time to finish the career that took off in 1975 with the ballad `` Midnight Blue.'' But this show business veteran, once a backup singer for <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>, has seen how tentative `` retirements'' usually are. A few years away and <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION> got the urge to belt'em out again. Not new material, however, old material. `` When I gained distance and perspective from the music industry, it came to me as to what I was really up to doing,'' she said. `` Once I became clear it was the right thing to do and it was basically in my truth, all the details fell into place.'' Having grown up on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, the 38-year-old <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> was drawn to sophisticated ladies of jazz such as Billie Holiday and <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> and the polished compositions of <PERSON> Hoagy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>. She knew, however, that it was best to step lightly into shoes so large. `` I felt I was ready and had grown enough to pay tribute to these women who were heroines in my youth,'' she explained. `` It was not at all about competing with these women _ that would be folly. It was simply to acknowledge their greatness, and the greatness of their songs.'' So <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> was n't looking to `` cover'' the songs, just polish them up a little. On `` Over the Rainbow,'' she wrestled with the memory of <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>'s anguished performance at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in 1961, a sad departure from the innocence of the `` The Wizard of Oz.'' `` To this day, it's riveting and gut-wrenching and a testimonial to her experience,'' <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I'm bringing my own experience and I see it as an anthem-like, optimistic song. There is an inner life to songs, particularly if you have signature songs that you're going to have to sing all your life. It's interesting how your life affects a song you're singing. Young singers wishing to pay tribute to <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> might skip the 1982 Grammy winner, `` You Should Hear How She Talks About You,'' and go back to `` Midnight Blue,'' which <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION> co-wrote with <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sager </PERSON>. They wanted <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON> <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> to sing it, but producer <PERSON> Vini </PERSON> <PERSON> Poncia </PERSON> was so impressed with the demo that he used <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> instead. `` Midnight Blue'' peaked on the charts at No. 6. `` I was really unconscious in those days. ` We're on the charts?' ` What does that mean?' ` Are we all suppose to do something, open a bottle of champagne?' I was very young and I had no sense of packaging. I just wanted to write and sing. I did n't care what I looked like, that I looked a mess or not.'' `` Talks About You,'' with its snappy, updated `` girl group'' sound, was n't her idea, <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> insists. By then, her career needed a boost and she agreed to take chances with a slicker, more aggressive sound. It worked, but at a price. `` The risk is you shave off a little slice of your soul. I was shaving more and more pieces and in real danger of giving the whole thing away. My soul was too important to me. <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON> wrote, ` Where is my spirit, I'm nowhere near it.''' Fourteen years after `` Midnight Blue,'' <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> is still thinking about <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON>, capping her tribute record with the hit `` Walk on By,'' which first came out in 1964. `` I was always touched by ` Walk on By.' It was always this very traumatic and dark and moody song about what's not said in a relationship. I wanted to produce the record to be deeper and more spacious and more dramatic.'' And when it was time to make a video, <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> resisted a straight romantic interpretation, transferring one of today's issues onto one of yesterday's hits `` I thought of the title, ` Walk on By.' The description of what we did in society when we pass images that are disquieting, such as homelessness,'' she said. `` I came up with this idea of playing a homeless woman with two children and having to leave the two children at the shelter. We in fact filmed at a shelter in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and I got to speak to several of the women there. It semed like a good idea and turned into a real educational experience.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Mordecai Richler's Most Ambitious Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mordecai </PERSON> <PERSON> Richler </PERSON> has a standard answer ready for those who wonder about the apparent similarities between the fictional <PERSON> Gursky </PERSON> family in his new novel and a certain real-life Canadian dynasty that soared to wealth and prominence in the whiskey business. `` My reply will be that I would n't want five years' work reduced to the level of prurient gossip,'' he says. Indeed, <PERSON> Richler </PERSON> closes the lively new book, `` Solomon Gursky Was Here,'' with an author's note that simply states: `` I made the Gurskys up out of my own head.'' The Montreal-based writer is frequently repeating his answer on the promotional tour that is helping to make the novel, his first since `` <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> Then and Now'' in 1980, one of the big books of the Canadian fall publishing season. It will appear next spring in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a short while later in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` I think there are two or three superficial resemblances in their early careers, but it's not about that family at all,'' <PERSON> Richler </PERSON>, 58, said of the <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> family, who built <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION>'s into the world's largest distilling company. He noted that the novel not only includes those `` superficial resemblances'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Bronfmans </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> but also ranges over Canadian territory from the <LOCATION> Prairies </LOCATION> to the Arctic and covers subjects from anti-Semitism to the search for the Northwest Passage. `` You write a novel, and it's very difficult to follow it around with explanations,'' <PERSON> Richler </PERSON> said. `` I feel I've had my say.'' The atmosphere of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>'s prominent Jewish community has served <PERSON> Richler </PERSON> well in his past novels, such as `` The Apprenticeship of <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravitz </PERSON>'' and `` St. Urbain's Horsemen.'' `` It's certainly the most complex novel I've ever attempted,'' <PERSON> Richler </PERSON> said of his new work. He was interviewed, looking slightly rumpled and smoking small Dutch cigars, at breakfast during his visit to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> for an authors' festival. `` It's his longest novel yet, and by far his most ambitious and imaginative,'' reviewer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> wrote in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s Globe and Mail newspaper. `` Whether it's his most satisfying is open to debate.'' <PERSON> Richler </PERSON> works regularly as a journalist and is one of the Canadian writers turned to frequently by foreign publications seeking a home-grown view of the country. He has been working lately on an article about the English-French language tensions in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. The province's English minority lives for the most part in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, the largest city in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. `` It's a quarrel more appropriate to a schoolyard. Whichever side you're on, it's somewhat embarrassing to be quarreling about signs,'' <PERSON> Richler </PERSON> said. Quebec provincial laws restrict the language on all outdoor commercial signs to French. `` It's a very wasting tribal quarrel. It has little to do with the real problems of the country,'' he said. During the hard-fought 1988 campaign over whether <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> should go ahead with a free-trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he lined up not with such writing heavyweights as <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> against the pact but with a lesser known group supporting it. `` I just felt that it was a trade deal,'' <PERSON> Richler </PERSON> said. `` I hope it will work out well. The test will be if it creates more jobs.'' The opponents of the pact, which took effect last Jan. 1, argued that Canadian culture could be overwhelmed if trade barriers were lowered with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I thought there was a certain amount of hysteria,'' <PERSON> Richler </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think the free trade deal is going to destroy the <ORGANIZATION> CBC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- or Canadian publishing; if I thought so, I would be against it.'' <PERSON> Richler </PERSON> sees an ironic touch to his having taken positions that made him anathema to hard-core Canadian nationalists and his now having written `` a resoundingly Canadian novel.'' He said his publishers seem to believe the material will be considered exotic elsewhere and not be harmed by readers' lack of knowledge about <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` They think it's a very commercial novel,'' he said. <PERSON> Richler </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, mostly in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, for two decades, returning to his native <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> in 1972. He also has worked as a screenwriter, including the screenplay for `` The Apprenticeship of <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravitz </PERSON>,'' and written two well-received children's books.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Jeff Brock's Music Is All Over Television</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> has never recorded a hit song, but people who watch TV frequently hear his music. The 39-year-old <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> is president of a `` music house,'' a company that provides tunes for TV commercials. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Music </PERSON>, his company, has won or shared five Clios or ADDYs, national awards for excellence in advertising. Some of his best-known music accompanied these spots: _ Actor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Farnsworth </PERSON> posing in a desert eating chips with the tag line, `` the flavor's a legend.'' _ Fast-food hamburger containers open their lids and talk to each other. _ A bleach with the hook line, `` Do n't just get'em clean, get'em vivid.'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> provides music to advertising agencies that have contracts with major corporations. He comes up with original music or arranges a well-known song that already has been chosen for an ad. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, who supervises a staff of four plus several free-lance music writers and arrangers, says music is important to the overall content. `` I think music plays an immense role in the memorability of a spot. When you have 5-year-old kids running around singing jingles all day, you know it has a lot of impact on people's minds,'' he said. He estimates that 70 percent of his work is `` post scores'' _ seeing the ad without music and writing a tune to emphasize what's happening visually `` The music is supposed to be poignant and jump out,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. The guidelines vary. `` They will say they want something appealing to kids age 12 to young adults age 25. In that age group, you go for something hard hitting, something a little more rock' n' roll. `` Sometimes they say they want music like ... and they name the artist. I come up with something similar to that artist or that style,'' he said. `` Sometimes we go out on a limb and say we do n't think it will work and here's what we suggest. `` And in other cases, they say they have no earthly idea what they want. But they know it when they hear it. Those are the toughies. You may come up with something you think is incredibly good, but the client does n't.'' For a recent spot about food to be taken to work, he was instructed to come up with music that sounded `` classical, English, very proper.'' `` When I wrote those scores, I wrote from an acoustical standpoint with strings and woodwinds and light, fun, British-sounding music. It came out beautifully and they are airing nationally.'' He writes some lyrics, but most of the time they are written by the ad agency. `` We sort of pick up the ball and run with it wherever they decide to pass it off to us,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. He always knows the client, but sometimes it is top secret. `` We're not supposed to let out what we're doing or the campaign, and this can be painful because you've just done a wonderful session for someone and they are not going to break the campaign for three months and you ca n't even play it for anybody.'' In most cases, the spots are 30 seconds long, some only 15 seconds. `` You do n't get a chance to say much in 15 seconds,'' he said. The companies and products he has worked with include <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION>, Century 21, K mart, the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, Folgers, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON> Ralston </PERSON> <PERSON> Purina </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Music </PERSON> is one of about 15 <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> companies doing music for jingles. `` Our value is our versatility,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. `` We do all musical styles. We do a lot of different things well.'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> was raised in <LOCATION> Anderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and worked as a jingle singer in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> before he began writing jingles in 1975. He moved to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> the next year. Ten years ago he wrote the music for political advertising, including the music for <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s first campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` We helped to elect a lot of candidates,'' said <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, who also was a judge in the 1989 Miss America Pageant. He turned to jingle writing because he did n't want to continue doing political ads. His office complex has a small studio in the rear where most of the ad music is created. He plays keyboards himself as needed. `` I think when you have some leeway, and the agency allows you to be creative and do the job you feel is needed for that project, and it comes out wonderful, it's very satisfying.''

<HEAD>Routine Restraint of Nursing Home Residents Causes Growing Concern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> used to spend each day tied to a chair in a nursing home, sometimes in a stupor, sometimes pleading for release. `` They'd just sit there all day long, everybody tied in restraints,'' said <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, who moved her 70-year-old husband out in August. `` I do n't think he would be living now if he had n't gotten out of there. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>'s situation was not unique. Two out of five residents of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nursing homes routinely are tied to their beds or chairs, ostensibly to prevent injury. Yet concern is mounting that restraints may do more harm than good. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> now is at <LOCATION> Stapeley </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Germantown </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> home that is one of the growing number in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> using no restraints. `` Since he's been over at <LOCATION> Stapeley </LOCATION>, he' a a completely different person,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said. `` He does what he wants to do. He answers your questions. He walks up and down the hall. He goes into the lounge.'' Nursing homes say they use restraining devices such as lap belts, wheelchairs with locking trays, and vests tied to beds or chairs mainly to keep residents from falling or wandering away and to control aggressive behavior. Critics say restraints often are used for convenience and seldom eliminate the risk of injury. They say restraints can create problems including emotional withdrawal, depression, injuries incurred trying to get free, strangulation, constipation, incontinence, pressure sores, loss of bone mass, weakened muscles, decreased ability to walk and eventual invalidism. `` We have to ask ourselves: What price safety?'' said <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakeslee </PERSON>, director of health services for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kendal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> corporation governed by Quakers that has pioneered the concept of restraint-free nursing homes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Safe and quality care can be given to our frail old people without tying them to their beds and their chairs.'' <PERSON> Kendal </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging this month sponsored a symposium, `` Untie the Elderly: Quality Care Without Restraints,'' where <PERSON> Blakeslee </PERSON> urged: `` Think about yourself as you grow old. Is that what you would want?'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Plevyak </PERSON>'s family chose to place his 74-year-old mother, <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON>, who has Alzheimer's disease, at Friends Hall in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, because it uses no restraints. `` The only thing she desires to do is move about and walk,'' he said. `` That's why we're so thrilled that she is in a facility that allows her to engage in the one activity she gets any joy out of.'' Forty-one percent of nursing home residents were restrained in 1988, up from 25 percent in 1977, federal surveys show. Thirty-five people in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian nursing homes strangled or suffocated because of restraints from 1980 to 1987 and two burned to death trying to escape by lighting their restraints, the Press-Telegram of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, reported in a 1987 investigation. In <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian nursing homes studied over the last decade, restraint rates ranged from 25 percent to 85 percent, <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Strumpf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> reported in the January 1989 issue of the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geriatrics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Family members initially may be horrified that a relative is restrained, but medical professionals `` can talk people into a big variety of things that afterwards they must wonder about,'' said <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell-Pederson </PERSON>, a nurse at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boniface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boniface </LOCATION> has nearly eliminated restraints since a patient strangled in 1981. On the other hand, there are attorneys and family members `` wanting and willing to sue if a home does n't use protective devices to protect the safety of the resident,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convalescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` We've got to get over that hurdle.'' <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> was restraint-free when it opened 12 years ago but began using the devices under pressure from insurers, doctors and families, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. It now restrains 20 percent to 30 percent of its patients, but is reducing that. The widespread use of restraints is widely attributed at least in part to nursing homes' fear of being sued, but some attorneys say reliance on restraints as a shield against litigation is largely unneeded. A study of cases found that use of restraints led to more successful lawsuits than non-use, said <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON> Kendal </PERSON>'s board. For example, an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> jury in June held a nursing home liable for $ 2.5 million in the strangulation of an 86-year-old woman in a restraint vest that was on backwards. The ruling is under appeal. Restraints `` became a standard of care without ever being tested,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, a consultant for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everybody just assumed they did good.'' Growing concern about negative effects and recognition that restraints do n't eliminate legal risk are spurring a reduction in their use. Thirteen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nursing homes are known to be restraint-free, according to <PERSON> Kendal </PERSON>. Tough new federal rules take effect in October, and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has untied 3,000 people since August. `` There's a contest going on to see who's going to be the first restraint-free facility,'' said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> licensing director <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheren </PERSON>. `` This is not a movement in its infancy,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubler </PERSON>, an attorney in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Montefiore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This is a discussion on the verge of bringing change.'' The new federal rules ban `` physical restraints imposed or psychoactive drugs administered for purposes of discipline or convenience, and not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms.'' Nursing homes for the first time will have to `` show that they have tried every other conceivable means to solve the problem,'' <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> said. Removing restraints requires creative, individualized alternatives, said <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kendal </PERSON> associate director for health services. For example, doors that sound a buzzer when opened might be installed on wanderers' rooms, brightly colored tape in front of exits helps discourage confused residents from leaving, and rocking chairs can soothe residents who need to be in motion. One home was able to avoid restraining an 85-year-old woman who constantly paced with a doll but needed rest so her ulcers could heal, said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rader </PERSON>, director of mental health at <ORGANIZATION> Benedictine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. Staff members filled the doll with seven pounds of birdseed `` Now, when she's walking with the doll, she has a very heavy baby. So they said, ` Oh, that baby's so heavy. Why do n't you sit down and put your feet up?' That's a heck of a lot more fun than tying a person down,'' <PERSON> Rader </PERSON> said. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boniface </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Mitchell-Pederson </PERSON> cited the case of an Alzheimer's patient who disrupted meals and stole food. `` When we asked, ` Could he be hungry?' and doubled his calorie intake, he stopped stealing food. ... In this case it was his diet that needed attention; restraints compounded the problem.'' An 85-year-old woman restrained in a chair for fear she would wander off and fall down the stairs was given rubber-soled shoes instead of slippers and `` was thus allowed to wander at will throughout the building,'' she said. `` There's tremendous excitement out there ... toward developing and implementing a non-restraint philosophy,'' <PERSON> Rader </PERSON> said. `` It's no fun to be the one who has to tie someone down when they do n't want to be tied down

 Some nursing home officials, however, caution that there are cases where there are no clear alternatives to restraints. `` While we all can agree that overuse or wholesale use of restraints is not desirable, it is equally wrong to say no restraints should ever be used,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mettler </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hillhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which runs 345 nursing homes in 38 states. `` This is not a black-and-white issue,'' <PERSON> Mettler </PERSON> said. `` Sometimes it may even be necessary to restrict the rights of an individual resident in order to provide for the health and safety of others.'' For dramatic reduction in restraints, residents and families must accept that `` if people have a certain amount of freedom, then they also run the risk of getting hurt,'' said attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivancic </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> HFIC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which handles insurance claims for <ORGANIZATION> Hillhaven </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Benedictine </ORGANIZATION> has eliminated most restraints, but `` there's maybe 5 to 10 percent of the people that I ca n't figure out how to get restraint-free,'' <PERSON> Rader </PERSON> said, citing as one example those who pull out tubes unless restrained. Nursing home staffers who initially are skeptical about managing residents without restraints usually find they prefer it, said <PERSON> Kendal </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>. She quoted from a recent letter from a nurse at Friends Hall, which in 1987 adopted a no-restraint policy: `` I would n't work any other place now. I would n't have said that or believed it two years ago.'' Nine nursing homes in a Kendal demonstration program have reduced restraint use without an increase in falls, staff or costs, <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. That is possible because residents who can move around generally stay healthier and require less care, <PERSON> Blakeslee </PERSON> said. Also, it takes a lot of time to properly apply restraints and remove them for exercise and use of bathrooms. Stapeley in 1988 set a goal of untying five residents a month and a year later removed the last restraint, said <PERSON> Henrietta </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, executive director. `` I ca n't tell you how the families have been pleased by this,'' she said. `` The sense of humanitarianism, the sense that you are dealing with a person ... has made a great deal of difference. The patients are easier to care for.'' Supporters of the change at <LOCATION> Stapeley </LOCATION> include <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, whose 89-year-old mother, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, had been routinely restrained after she fell and broke a hip. Now, staffers help her walk and she wears no restraints while seated. `` She seems much more cheerful and positive as a result of having more freedom,'' <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said. `` Even though her mind was not working well, she was just the kind of person who wanted to get up and walk.''

 <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheren </PERSON> does n't like the phrase `` untying the elderly,'' but she wholeheartedly supports the concept. <PERSON> Cheren </PERSON>, who oversees 4,300 health care facilities, has led an effort to reduce nursing home use of restraints, untying 3,000 people in four months. `` The only thing that I feel bad about is that I did n't do it ... earlier.'' When <PERSON> Cheren </PERSON> became director of the state Office of Licensure and Certification two years ago, 41 percent of the 55,000 people in the state's 550 nursing homes were restrained at least part of the day by vests that fasten to beds or chairs, wrist ties, lap belts and specially designed chairs. Several elderly people had strangled in recent years struggling to free themselves. Use of restraints rose to 43.7 percent by April 1989, but was down to 39 percent last month, federal statistics show. <PERSON> Cheren </PERSON> did not have statistics on the use of tranquilizers, but said regulators would try to ensure that chemical restraints are not overly used and do not replace physical restraints. <PERSON> Cheren </PERSON> stepped up regulation of restraint use in August, when she told <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> it could not admit new residents until it stopped illegally using restraints simply to prevent wandering. Under <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law, restraints can be used to keep people from falling or from disturbing medical equipment, such as feeding tubes. They can not be used without a doctor's permission, and people must be released every two hours. Restraint reduction has caught on in the industry `` because first of all it's right,'' she said. `` Second, it feels good. Nobody likes to put somebody under restraint. You interact differently with somebody in restraint. Three, it's working, and success builds on success.'' <PERSON> Cheren </PERSON>, a registered nurse with 20 years' involvement in long-term care, dislikes the phrase `` untying the elderly'' because it casts the elderly in a passive role _ `` just like ` release women' or ` free the blacks,''' she said. Also, physical restraints came into use out of sincere concern for safety. However, she said, it is time to focus on better nursing home care that involves helping peple keep and restore their abilities. About 1,000 nursing home owners and operators attended three workshops on restraints in October and November. Instead of being apprehensive about meeting new standards, people were bragging about the progress they had made. `` People called me afterwards ... and told me their goal for this year was to completely move toward a restraint-free environment,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> for the Aging. The 454-bed <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged, for example, cut use of restraints 18 percent, said associate executive director <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>. `` The residents are much happier, less agitated and the staff has noted a significant decrease in the amount of agitation and less acting out.'' Many operators have reported resistance from families who think nursing home residents are safer if they are restrained, Early said. But <PERSON> Cheren </PERSON> and other advocates of reducing restraints say the losses that occur in mobility, bladder control and dignity far outweigh the small risk of a serious injury due to a fall. `` The bottom line really is that the risk of falling really ai n't so bad,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Casper </PERSON>, executive director of 250-bed Greynolds Park Manor in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, which now restrains four people, compared to 85-90 this summer. And while there has been concern that restraint reduction would increase costs _ <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> homes operate on a profit margin of less than 0.5 percent _ <PERSON> Casper </PERSON> said he has found the cost of staff supervision remained the same. <PERSON> Cheren </PERSON> can even count among her supporters the administrator of <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, which lost an estimated $ 60,000 because of the moratorium, the toughest stricture possible short of license revocation. `` I think <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheren </PERSON> has done a fine thing,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, who had 10 of 80 beds empty during the 60-day penalty. `` Connie <PERSON> Cheren </PERSON> having zeroed in on this particular thing ... has made the difference.'' The home has fixed an alarm system that sounds when a door is opened and set up a `` buddy'' system in which workers _ even office and housekeeping staff _ adopt a resident for special daily attention, including walks. Except for six or eight `` geri-chairs'' for people who ca n't sit alone, it has no restraints. `` We're very much in agreement with the whole philosophy of non-restraint facilities,'' <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> said. `` It's an excellent thing to give people the freedom of movement.''

 <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> never considered he'd ever have to choose a nursing home for his wife, an active, intelligent 52-year-old mother of five. Then <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s personality began to change, and months of tests pointed to Alzheimer's disease. After three years of home care, Mrs. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s behavior became so erratic her family made the painful decision in 1985 to place her in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Retirement </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Honey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` She would wander off, pick up things to eat anywhere, out on the road, hitchhike, stop cars,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> recalled. When family members visited, however, they were troubled to find that more often than not, Mrs. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> was strapped down to keep her from wandering and eating foreign objects. `` She seemed very upset and so were we,'' said her daughter, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> McTyier </PERSON>. `` Mom no longer was able to speak but she would often look very angry or grumpy whenever we visted. Dad often made the comment, ` It looks as if she's saying, Why are you doing this to me?''' Last January, <PERSON> Tel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hai </PERSON> launched a program to reduce its use of restraints, cutting the rate from 43 percent of patients to less than 10 percent. Confused residents who once were tied down now are free to stroll an outdoor `` wandering garden''; those who were restrained because they were unsteady on their feet have been fitted with sturdy walking shoes. `` I remember from my nursing school days, it was considered a standard of good care to restrain residents who might fall and injure themselves,'' said assistant administrator <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersheim </PERSON>. `` But now there's been a bubbling up from within the health-care providers saying there's a better way.'' The resulting new freedom has improved Mrs. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s demeanor and that of other residents, Ms. <PERSON> McTyier </PERSON> said at a recent symposium on restraints. `` She's calmed down visibly and we've also noticed an overall happier attitude in the whole facility. It used to disturb us when we would walk in and hear the residents moaning and crying for help. Since the change, the noise level has dropped considerably. ... `` The nursing home does n't seem like such a prison anymore when you walk through and do n't find people strapped down all the time.''

<HEAD>Factors to Consider in Choosing a Nursing Home</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-PRI--Untie the Elderly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 When considering the use of restraints, weigh potential benefits such as safety and comfort against potential negatives including the loss of mobility, depression and anxiety, says the <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, family members and nursing home residents should watch for these signs of possible abuse of physical restraints: _ DISCOLORATION: Is there redness, bruising, blanching or welts _ PAIN: Do the restraints cause pain in wrists, waist, chest or feet _ BEHAVIOR: Is there squirming in an attempt to get comfortable Does the resident bend forward trying to loosen restraints or rock back and forth?

 People trying to choose a nursing home can gather important information by relying on their senses. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> suggests considering these factors: _ SIGHT: How do resident look Are they up, dressed, clean, chatting among themselves and staff, or slumped in a wheelchair? Do rooms look personal or institutional? _ SOUND: Is there a general level of chatter as in a normal household Or is there noise blaring from the TV and cries of help or `` nurse''? _ SMELL: Does the home smell good or does it smell of urine or a cover-up of heavy disinfectant Does the food from the kitchen smell good? _ TASTE: Eat a meal if you can If not, ask residents how the food is. Are they eating it? _ TOUCH: Are handrails, bathrooms, etc., clean to the touch Residents will reach out to you. Take their hands. Are they clean, with well-lubricated skin and trimmed nails, or are the hands sticky or dry, with ragged nails? Also ask about quality of care and payment policies, the coalition says. _ QUALITY OF CARE: Ask residents and their families, physicians, clergy and others what they think about various facilities Visit as many nursing homes as possible. Find out about staff. Is there a trained social worker and a trained activities director? Do they have assistants? How does the home handle potential staffing shortages? Does staff turn over quickly? _ PAYMENT: Most nursing home residents, even if they pay privately when they enter, run out of money Unless someone is sure they can pay indefinitely with private funds, they should choose a home that accepts Medicaid, find out what their state's Medicaid eligibility rules are, and what their rights are or will be as a Medicaid nursing home resident. Contact your state Office on Aging to get the name and telephone number of the nearest long-term care ombudsman program. Ombudsmen are empowered by law to serve as advocates for nursing home residents and to assist with complaints.

 <PERSON> Frieda </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> strides into her exercise class, warmed from a brisk bicycle ride, and puts away her helmet. She's ready for her three-times-a-week class of stretching, floor exercises, and physical activity to music ranging from 1950s doo-wop to classical to the Grateful Dead's `` Touch of Gray.'' Most in the class have their own touches of gray.

Mrs. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 73, logged 1,886 miles last year, just completed her ninth RAGBRAI _ an annual bicycle ride across <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> _ and rode her bicycle at least 10 miles a day this summer. She posted the most miles last year in a walking-jogging program, which credits three miles of bicycling as one mile of walking. `` In cold weather, I walk at <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` The rest of the time I ride my bike alone.'' Others in the program are just discovering the rewards of fitness. `` By age ... alone, there is no limit'' to when a person can begin an exercise program, said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rachow </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's as fine if they're 89 as if they're 63 and about to retire.'' <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Casserly </PERSON>, 62, of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, joined the senior fitness class in February. `` The first time I went, I did n't think I would be able to get off the floor.'' Seven months later, she weighed 10 pounds less, had cut her blood-pressure medication by a third and felt better `` physically and emotionally.'' <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkema </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Walnut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> older adults fitness program, said it has grown from seven members in 1981 to about 100. It is one of 34 Y's in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> with such programs, which generally include 25 to 50 participants. Most people walk or bike in addition to the organized class and keep logs of ground covered. They also meet monthly for lunch and get together frequently to tour <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, talk about trips or discuss the restoration of the Statehouse. The activity leaves participants with more energy to do more, both physically and mentally, <PERSON> Harkema </PERSON> said. `` They can go to the grocery store and not be short of breath. They can stay up an hour later. The seniors who may have lost a spouse will regain new friendships. They realize they have strengths they never knew they had.'' <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapscheske </PERSON>, 70, attends the program with her best friend of 47 years, 72-year-old <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, and describes it as `` our own special time.'' Both have been in the senior fitness program for six years. `` I'm able to get up the stairs when other people my age are out of breath,'' she said. Rachow advises patients to start an exercise program slowly, by walking, riding a stationary bicycle or swimming. Someone who wants to gain strength can `` start by lifting the weight of your own limb,'' he said. `` It does n't have to be a fancy Nautilus machine.'' Regular exercise tends to decrease anxiety and depression and the severity of muscle shrinkage, brittle bones and high blood pressure, he said. `` There's already a tendency as you age to lose muscle mass. Once you get weak, you end up going down into a chair and not being able to get back up again.'' Exercise also burns calories, and avoiding obesity can help prevent high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and diabetes. One reason 75-year-old <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> attends the class is so he `` can eat a little more,'' but the main reason, he said, is `` for the girls.''

 When families lived together, older people were a link between the past and future, reminiscing about the history they'd lived. Today, families are far-flung and often out of touch, but the need for a link remains. `` One of the important lessons of the book ` Roots' is that family and society are enormously interested in the past experiences of individuals that they know,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a psychiatrist and deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging. `` Look at how excited people are to look at old photo albums. That's a form of reminiscing.'' `` A lot of people have stories in them, but they have n't written them down because there's just no place for their writing to appear,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> who, with partner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelian </PERSON>, offers just such a forum. The two in May 1988 launched Harvest, a literary magazine featuring the reminiscences of people over 50. <PERSON> Michaelian </PERSON>, 33, and <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, 29, who both grew up in storytelling families, are n't interested in family histories that merely list the comings and goings of a particular family or group of people Harvest is filled mainly with the remembrances of everyday people whose good times and bad times preceded shopping malls, freeways and fast-food restaurants. The bimonthly magazine has grown in circulation to about 1,500 and gets about 40 or 50 submissions a week from around the country. Harvest does n't pay, but people whose articles are published get 10 free copies. Some stories are sent by professionals, but most writers have never had anything published. `` We're looking for stories that really have something to say. Whether it's polished or not is not our major concern. We just want to present simple, honest stories,'' <PERSON> Michaelian </PERSON> said. `` We look for something that has lasting meaning to someone's life,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said `` There used to be a role for older people as storytellers. They used to be valued for that. They've been through good times and bad times. They have perspective, and some of their reflections can teach you a great deal.'' Consider `` Thanksgiving 1930,'' a story in the November-December issue. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessler </PERSON> recalls waiting for several days during the Depression to get a free food basket from the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bessler </PERSON> describes huddling with his brothers and sister in the family's Model T to keep warm after their meal: `` When you're in a warm place and your belly is full and you have someone to hold, what more could you want? I was thankful for Thanksgiving Day. I was satisfied. I had a good deal.'' Such reminiscences offer younger people new perspectives _ `` they invariably derive new insights about themselves'' _ while being a healthy experience for older people, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` For a number of people, it can be a very helpful and therapeutic process that brings them back to a broader perspective in terms of what their life has been. `` The past has undoubtedly contained a number of situations which at the time might have seemed insurmountable but yet we found that we've gotten over them. Those reminders are very important to help restore someone's perspective on the present.''

 The speed with which society has responded to the AIDS epidemic is heartening, yet there is one group that society has not begun to attend to in terms of its risk: older Americans. The fact is, 10 percent of all reported cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have involved people aged 50 and over. And more older people are believed to be infected, although not yet experiencing symptoms. With increased age comes a decline in immune system functions, making older people more susceptible to a variety of illnesses such as cancers and infections. Because of these changes in immune function, AIDS may affect older people differently than it does the young. Data from the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> suggests that most older people infected with the AIDS virus have developed disease symptoms more quickly than younger patients. The older population also receives the highest rate of blood transfusions. Blood banks now assure safer blood products than before 1985, when the public blood supply was not yet being screened for the virus. By then, however, many older people had already been exposed to possibly contaminated transfusions. As a result, blood transfusions are the second most common cause of AIDS in people over 50 -LRB- after sexual contact -RRB-. Moreover, no one knows how many people received infected blood and are now unknowingly infecting spouses or sexual partners. Older AIDS patients who have early symptoms also risk going undiagnosed. Because early symptoms of AIDS, such as fatigue, loss of appetite and swollen glands, are similar to other more common illnesses, many people _ including health professionals _ may dismiss them as minor ailments. Medical experts predict that a cure or vaccine against AIDS is not likely to be found in the near future. So preventing the spread of AIDS will very much depend on behavioral changes, such as using condoms when sexually involved with someone other than a mutually faithful, uninfected partner. Prevention also begins with education. AIDS is not spread by casual contact, but rather through sexual relations, use of infected needles and blood transfusions. Reliable, up-to-date information is available from many sources. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> sent a brochure, `` Understanding AIDS,'' to every home in the country. Call the National AIDS Hotline, 1-800-342-AIDS for another copy; other hotlines also can answer specific questions. Researchers are working to understand AIDS and how to treat people who are infected. Treatment for the symptoms usually involves some drug therapy, such as AZT -LRB- azidothymidine -RRB-, which currently is being used in many patients to prolong life. Other promising drugs are also being tested. People exposed to the virus should stay in touch with a doctor who is well-informed about the latest research. For help finding an expert, call a medical school's infectious disease department or the National AIDS Hotline. You can make a valuable contribution by offering to help groups in your community who work with AIDS patients. Many operate on a shoestring and depend heavily on individual contributions of time and money. These groups include the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, March of Dimes, <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION>, and the local <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION>. Their phone numbers are listed in your directory, and they will be glad to tell you how to get involved with education, fund-raising drives or volunteer programs. In the years ahead, individuals willing to offer their services to AIDS patients will be increasingly needed. Volunteers can contribute a great deal without endangering their health. For example, as people with AIDS become more disabled, they have trouble meeting their daily needs; they appreciate help with shopping, cooking meals, or just regular visits for talking. For more information on volunteer programs, call your health department or the National AIDS Hotline.

 If maintaining a home landscape is more work than pleasure, a few changes may help. Retirement offers a splendid opportunity to take time for a detailed assessment, and it's worth doing whether you're 20 or 70. Start by determining what you and the family like, dislike or have no strong opinion about. Be realistic. Be pragmatic. Be diplomatic. But above all, get an honest reading. Then, have a little fun and adopt `` KISS'' as the game plan: Keep It Simple, Stupid. For example, is it worth the effort to plant, water, weed, fertilize and prune that bed of annual flowers or bulbs? Would low-maintenance flowering shrubs be as pleasing? Do n't apologize if the choice is the bed of flowers; just be sure. And say KISS often when looking at things that take time. Before I retired, my home had a gorgeous lawn. There was <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> grass in summer and, in this subtropical climate, even greener ryegrass all winter. At least once a week, I'd empty the mower's grasscatcher seven or eight times The family loved that lawn _ badminton, croquet, just sprawling on the grass. But children and grandchildren grow older. It was used less and less. Water bills kept climbing. Decomposed granite and native shrubs and trees became an increasingly attractive alternative. Now, I fill only one grasscatcher each time I mow. The saving in time alone is considerable. One person's solution, of course, can be another's horror story. But the basics never change: simplify maintenance by eliminating unnecessary things. Folks who move to a different climate also need to forget nostalgia. Heroic urban horticulture may keep alive long-time favorites from other states, but it's usually time-consuming, expensive and generally self-defeating. Make sure, say, that a lilac or ceanothus will grow in the new neighborhood. Can you even tell the difference between the East's lilac and the West's ceanothus Take the time to understand your plants' needs. Can they be replaced with something better or simpler? The <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, listed under the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> in most telephone books, is a good source. Hybrid tea roses are an example of something that can be changed without much difficulty. Their floral display is seldom matched, yet they need enormous care. One solution is to have a hybrid tea or two for cut flowers and replace the others with less demanding types such as floribunda or shrub roses. Systemic insecticides eliminate a lot of mixing of chemicals and spraying. Just be sure to follow the label directions carefully. Fertilizing often can be simplified with slow-release types, though these tend to be expensive and can be deadly if timing of the application induces plant growth when it should be slowing. But they're a great convenience and unmatched in container growing. Avoid scattered plantings. If cutting the grass, can you keep going for long periods without backing and turning? Does a certain shrub have to be where it impedes the mower? Would a mowing strip eliminate hand trimming? Perhaps stone or gravel would look better in areas under garden benches or house overhangs. Is a raised bed called for? Does traffic make grass a losing battle in a certain area, dictating paving? Would ground cover hide litter from a tree? Do some plants always seem to be nibbled by grasshoppers, attacked by aphids or sunburned? Why not replace them? Consider the same approach for a tree or shrub that requires frequent pruning or leaf raking. A pre-emergence herbicide will control many weeds before they start. Vegetation-killing sprays formulated with glyphosate are one of the most important gardening developments in recent years. Even toughies like <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> are a soft touch, but do n't get it close to anything green you want to keep. Sometimes changing the land's contour just an inch or two is all that's needed to improve drainage. Maybe a shade-loving plant is getting too much sun, while moving it a few feet will make it happy. A mulch can give a neat appearance, save moisture and protect against climate extremes. The list of potential problem-solvers is just about endless. But no solution is possible until the problem is pinpointed.

<HEAD>Fear of Crime Makes Elderly Prisoners in Own Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many of the retirees who move to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to enjoy their `` golden years'' wind up prisoners in their homes because of their fear of crime, a state task force on crime and the elderly reported. The 65-page report concluded that people over 60 are victimized less often than younger people, but `` the resulting injuries or incurred damages are more devastating'' for the older victims. `` Older persons live in abject terror of such every-day occurrences as going to the grocery store or merely stepping outside to pick up their Social Security checks,'' it said. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has the oldest population in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; by next year, more than 2.4 million people 65 and older will live in the Sunshine State. `` The high concentration of the aged in one environmental setting acts as a magnet to criminals,'' said the report by the Attorney General's <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Crimes and the Elderly. `` Public housing, especially for the elderly, is a prime target for purse snatchings, robberies and burglaries.'' Additionally, the elderly are more likely to be harmed or held hostage during a burglary attempt as failing vision or hearing leave them unaware there is someone in the house. And `` the elderly are perceived by juveniles as easy targets for violence and crime,'' said the report. In addition to threats from unknown criminals, the elderly are particularly vulnerable to smooth-talkers. It is extremely easy to control someone's assets, merely by having them sign a power of attorney, and some unscrupulous funeral homes are adept at catching the elderly at vulnerable times, the report said. Among its recommendations, the task force urged creating a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elderly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, a measure already approved by voters in 1988. The report said the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> had become too large and bureaucratic to function efficiently and that the agency's Division of Aging and <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> appeared to be the poor stepchild of a cumbersome system. The report, based on research and testimony gathered during four months last winter, also noted that the state has begun revising its guardianship laws and imposing tougher penalties for crimes committed against elderly citizens.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index closed at yet another record high today, while the dollar edged down against the Japanese yen for the fourth consecutive trading day. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 257.69 points, or 0.67 percent, closing at 38,681.31. The previous record closing was 38,586.18, set on Dec. 18. The dollar closed at 142.37 yen, down 0.35 yen from Monday's finish of 142.72 yen It opened at 142.94 yen and ranged between 142.30 yen and 142.95 yen. The dollar now has fallen 1.86 yen in the last four trading days. Currency trading was inactive as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and some other overseas markets were closed for Christmas. An estimated $ 4.14 billion traded hands in spot trading.

<HEAD>Housing Is Still A Good Investment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For financial analysts seeking an audience there is an almost sure formula: Forecast that the housing market is going to be reduced to rubble. Anything about housing has a wide audience. More than 60 percent of households own their homes, and many renters would like to own. Homeowners have big investments. They worry about their money, and they are alert to anything said or done that might affect it. That includes forecasts, and helps explain why forecasts of housing debacles never cease. Several years ago, in fact, a book was written about the coming collapse of housing prices. The event was never recorded by any economic statistic or seismograph, but it did n't deter the forecaster. Similar warnings have been issued throughout 1989 and the surest bet you can make is that the outpouring of doom, much of it from financial people who tend to measure housing as an investment only, will continue in 1990. At the moment, in fact, there exists a popular notion that single-family home sales and prices have declined sharply in much of the country, especially in the Northeast. Specific collapses, always available, are used to illustrate. The specifics, however, do n't always make a generalization. National data show that the median price of existing single-family homes in October 1988 was $ 88,900. One year later, in October of this year, it was $ 92,100. That's a gain of 3.6 percent. Data for the Northeast, compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, shows the price of typical new single-family homes in October 1988 was $ 144,400, and in October 1989 $ 143,300. That's a decline of 0.8 percent, hardly a disaster and one barely worth mentioning in the stock market. At that, the significance might be overdone. Oddly, that decline in the price of new houses, tiny as it is, might indicate strength rather than weakness. To wit: Falling interest rates in 1989 encouraged buyers who earlier had been priced out of the market. Clearly, these people would n't seek the most expensive homes; they would buy in the middle ranges, creating a lower median. In spite of warnings and forecasts, home prices have been remarkably stable or strong year after year. Industrial and commercial real estate might not have done well, but single-family housing is distinct from them. What has changed is the fortunes of banks that made bad loans, and in this way a banking problem becomes a so-called crisis in real estate. Since 1972, <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> figures show not one year in which prices of new and existing homes have failed to rise nationally, although there have indeed been been regional or local declines. But, while bad news in one stock, unless it is <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, rarely is used to suggest a general market decline, that reasoning is n't always applied to housing. Housing is, in fact, an even better investment than shown on some popular Wall Street charts of relative values. Most charts of comparative investments relate the percentage gains in housing to the total price. However, most Americans put down but a fraction of the price when buying homes. They take loans instead. When ordinary folks buy stock they usually pay full price rather than go on margin, or borrow from the broker. To borrow may be unwise because of volatility. So, if a $ 10 stock rises $ 1 they usually have a 10 percent gain. When a $ 50,000 house, bought with $ 5,000 down, rises in value to $ 55,000 the apparent gain is also 10 percent. But, since it was purchased with only $ 5,000 down the real return to the homeowner is 100 percent. The homeowner pays interest on the mortgage, and real estate taxes, insurance and upkeep, but he or she also receives big income tax deductions not available to shareowners, and gets to sleep in the home-investment. Remember it the next time financial `` experts'' proclaim the end of the world in housing. And remember, some of these are the same ones who created a brokerage house recession and billions in bad loans for banks.

 <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has been punished for compensating a customer for losses in stock transactions, a company official said Tuesday. The official said the company had not violated any laws, but quoted <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Masahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozen </PERSON> as apologizing for unfairness to other investors. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has prohibited <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION>, one of four major Japanese securities firms, from raising capital through public share offerings for the time being, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The ministry also ordered the company to refrain from corporate customer business for two days, he added. Finance Ministry officials were not available for comment after office hours Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the ministry had discovered that <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> compensated for a corporate customer's losses in stock transactions between 1975 and 1980, but could not find out whether <PERSON> Daiwa </PERSON> had entered into a contract guaranteeing the customer against losses in stock transactions, a violation of the Securities and Exchange Law. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said the ministry's investigation showed <PERSON> Daiwa </PERSON> had obtained about 12 billion yen, or $ 84 million, from selling a subsidiary's stock and paid 11.3 billion yen to a customer that had lost in stock transactions and 700 million yen as a commission to a company that settled the matter. The Daiwa official confirmed such transactions, but declined to give figures. He said four former <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> employees involved in the affair would resign. The pay of Dozen and 11 other executives would be cut by 10 percent for periods of three months to one year, the official said. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said the ministry investigated after press reports alleged that <PERSON> Daiwa </PERSON> had filed false business reports to cover up losses it incurred in compensating the customer.

 Grain and soybean futures prices slipped in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with much of the selling stemming from warming temperatures in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Moderating temperatures after a two-week spell of severely cold weather eased transportation problems as well as demand for livestock feed.

It is early summer in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Dry weather during the planting season had stirred drought fears, but those concerns have faded as growing conditions improved in recent weeks. In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.10 -RCB- a bushel; corn futures were \ cent to -RCB- cent lower with March at $ 2.38 \ a bushel; oat futures were 1 cent to 1 \ cents lower with March at $ 1.53 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3 \ cents lower with January at $ 5.69 Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which also reflected the warmer temperatures in the nation's midsecton.

 The frigid weather that swept through much of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> over the holiday weekend has caused substantial damage to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s $ 3.5 billion citrus crop and hurt other important winter crops, agriculture officials say. `` This freeze has just devastated us,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodnight </PERSON>, commissioner in <LOCATION> Collier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which has many winter vegetable crops and some citrus. She said she planned to ask Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> for disaster aid this week. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, state officials estimate 70 percent of the citrus crop and 80 percent of the winter vegetable crop were destroyed when temperatures plunged into the low 20s and upper teens. Losses there were estimated at $ 200 million. But some <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials and growers predicted they would be higher because warming temperatures ruined any hopes of salvaging the frozen fruit for juice. Although <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials have n't released actual production losses, the freeze damage is likely to be substantial since much of the state's crop was still on the trees when temperatures dipped blow freezing starting on Saturday. The plunging temperatures taxed the state's utilities over the weekend and again today. The power companies tried to divide the misery by cutting electricity to different areas for short periods of time, but the moves wreaked havoc on citrus groves. Most growers abandoned traditional methods of protecting their crops, such as using smudge pots or wind machines, and instead used networks of microjets, which spray water on the trees to protect them from freezing. When the power went off, the protective irrigation systems failed. `` There was nothing I could do about it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heist </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> citrus grower. `` They turned off the electricity at about 9 a.m. -LRB- Sunday -RRB-. But it was too cold and the system froze in parts.'' `` We would have been better off not to turn on the system at all.'' <LOCATION> Immokalee </LOCATION>, a winter vegetable production center, was hit hard by the chill. Farmers said the area lost more than 90 percent of its tomatoes, peppers and other vegetables, which are worth more than $ 200 million yearly. Among the few happy farmers were strawberry growers who came through the hard freeze better than others. `` No wind, no problem,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parke </PERSON> of Parkesdale Farms, a berry farmer in <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A lack of wind allows irrigation systems to build an even layer of ice on fragile plants to protect the bloom. Wind scatters the water from sprinklers, allowing colder temperatures to get to the plants and damage or kill them. <PERSON> Parke </PERSON> estimated that the $ 162 million berry industry likely would suffer only half the loss expected. Growers were not the only agricultural workers suffering from the freeze. Migrant workers found their livelihood endangered. `` If there are n't any other crops to pick, these people do n't have any other place to work,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, program manager for the Beth-El Mission in <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> More than 10,000 migrant workers living in <LOCATION> Immokalee </LOCATION> for the picking season, which runs from November through May, may be unemployed. Before the freeze, they earned $ 40 to $ 125 a day.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said Tuesday that 1990 could be the toughest year in a decade for the auto industry, which already is hurting from declining sales and temporary layoffs <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said in a year-end statement that 1989 sales of 9.8 million cars and 5.1 million trucks mark a return to a `` more normal trend'' after four years of combined industry sales of 15.2 million to 16.3 million vehicles. He said sales estimates for 1990 of 9.5 million cars and 5 million light trucks are based largely on costly incentive programs across the industry in an attempt to drum up buyers. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said the industry has a production capacity of 22 million cars and trucks. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said `` 1990 is going to be even tougher, maybe the toughest year the industry has faced in a decade.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month launched a 45-day, $ 1,000 incentive on its minivans. The incentive, which ends Jan. 31, was the first-ever rebate on the automaker's popular minivans. The nation's Big Three automakers, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, last week announced temporary shutdowns of many assembly lines in January. Sales are expected to return to years-earlier levels because of decreased demand as people worried about the nation's economy postpone buying, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCandless </PERSON> said. But he added that the projected total of 14.5 million cars and trucks would be a `` pretty good year.'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1 billion cost-cutting program announced earlier this year and attempts to develop new technology are aimed at keeping the No. 3 automaker competitive.

 The dollar declined Tuesday against most key foreign currencies in extremely thin post-holiday trading. Gold prices fell here after rising in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The financial markets were closed on Monday in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in observance of Christmas. But dealings remained sparse Tuesday as many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> traders decided to extend their holiday and most European markets remained closed for Boxing Day.

The move, which boosts the value of the yen against the dollar, had been widely anticipated by the market, they said. Nonetheless, the overall sentiment toward the dollar remains bearish as prospects for lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates rise with more evidence of economic weakness, said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

 Three days before federal bank regulators approved a delay in seizing Lincoln Savings and Loan in May 1988, the private accountant whose audits influenced the decision switched jobs and went to work for the thrift's owner, according to documents and interviews. The two regulators whose votes delayed the seizure for a year say they did not know at the time that the accountant, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON>, had taken the new job _ said by one member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 900,000 annually. But in recent statements, former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> and board member <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said their decision concerning the fate of <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> _ the nation's costliest thrift failure _ might have been different if they had been informed. `` Certainly, it would have had an effect on the decision had he known,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, an aide to Wall. `` Could it have swung the other way -LRB- in favor of immediate seizure -RRB-? Maybe.'' Attempts to reach <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON> for comment proved futile. His lawyer also declined to discuss the matter, first reported by The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, and said that <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON> would not talk about it with reporters. By a 2-1 vote on May 5, 1988, the three-member bank board decided against a recommendation from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> regulators to seize the troubled savings and loan. The group decided instead to launch a new federal examination of the thrift's books. The effect of the decision was to permit the bank to continue operating for an additional year under the ownership of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. By the time the regulators ousted <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and took control on April 14, 1989, the cost of protecting depositors had soared, and may now total more than $ 2 billion Wall earlier this month resigned as head of the bank board's single-administrator agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, under pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because of his handling of the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> case He remains in the job until a successor is named. The delay in seizing <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> generated a barrage of news stories about <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, especially the $ 1.3 million he and associates contributed to campaigns and causes of five senators who intervened with the regulators on his behalf. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has begun a formal investigation to determine whether the intervention was linked to the money. All the senators have denied any wrongdoing. Since 1986, favorable audit reports on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> had been written by <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON>, who was managing partner in the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> office of the large accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> _ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> now </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Boland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s spokesman, said <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON> began working for <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s parent firm _ <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> _ on May 2, 1988, three days before the crucial meeting of the bank board. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON>'s salary with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> was $ 900,000 a year. An <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> memo confirmed the timing of the job change, saying that <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON> `` decided to accept a position with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> effective May 1, 1988.'' Last Nov. 7, <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON> refused to answer questions before <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' committee, claiming a Fifth Amendment constitutional right against self-incrimination. At the time <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON> switched jobs, the San Francisco-based regulators were telling the bank board that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was in such serious trouble that it should be taken over by the government. But <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON>'s audits, according to a transcript of the bank board's May 5, 1988 meeting, concluded that the thrift had enough reserves to cover losses and had met net worth requirements. Faced with the differing opinions, the bank board conducted its 2-1 vote to freeze <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s level of investments, transfer the bank board investigation from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciso </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and begin a new probe of the <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> thrift. Wall and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> voted in the majority, while board member <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. White constituted a single-vote minority who favored immediate government seizure. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said in an interview that he did n't know that <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON> had gone to work for American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> three days before the meeting. He said he `` would have been concerned'' had he known, and `` absolutely'' would have raised questions about the impartiality of the audits. `` We were were very dependent on the accountant's opinion,'' he said. Wall spokesman <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said his boss `` did not have any knowledge'' of the job change. `` At a minimum, he would have wanted to go back and check with <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said. `` No doubt we would have looked at things differently, because it would have made the data suspect. It's a significant factor if you knew perhaps these numbers were tainted.'' <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschberg </PERSON>, associate general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, said, `` We clearly have no evidence -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Atchison </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- committed any impropriety when he was a partner at Arthur Young.'' `` We have partners that leave all the time for better-paying jobs in industry,'' he said. `` It's not unusual. Just because <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> left does not mean the audit was improper.''

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Rocket After Florida Freeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Orange juice futures prices soared Tuesday after a weekend freeze in the South that damaged a portion of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> orange crop and wiped out 70 percent of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> citrus crop. Heating oil futures prices also climbed dramatically following an explosion at the nation's second-largest petrochemical refinery. On other commodity markets, coffee and cotton futures rose sharply, precious metals futures fell, livestock and meat futures advanced and grains and soybeans retreated. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the contract for January delivery of frozen concentrated orange juice jumped 16.1 cents to $ 1.531 a pound, an 11.8 percent gain. The contracts for March and May delivery rose their permitted daily limits of 5 cents a pound. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials said it was too early to estimate the damage that occurred to the state's $ 3.5 billion citrus crop when temperatures plunged below freezing over the weekend. <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> <PERSON> Georkakis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said her firm's early assessment was that 20 percent to 30 percent of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> orange crop had been destroyed, which would be less than was lost in Christmas Day 1983 freeze. But the market's reaction Tuesday indicated the damage was probably worse than most traders had expected, Ms. <PERSON> Georkakis </PERSON> said. Orange juice prices had been falling before the freeze threat surfaced last week, a reflection of increased Brazilian orange production, which is expected to reach a record 290 million boxes in 1990. Analysts said imports of Brazilian orange juice should make up for damage to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> crop. So instead of a sharp price increase at the retail level because of the freeze, Ms. <PERSON> Georkakis </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers may simply see a halt to falling prices or only a slight rise. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Behr </PERSON>, economic research director for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION>, said he had heard rumors that at least one <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> processor planned to raise its wholesale price of frozen concentrated orange juice to $ 1.50 from $ 1.37 a pound because of the freeze. Heating oil futures prices surged on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of a weekend explosion at an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> refinery in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, raising prospects of further spot oil shortages. The accident at the plant aggravated a price spike caused by the record-setting cold snap that has hit much of the nation. Supplies of home heating oil already were tight before the explosion and the accelerated demand has pushed retail prices as high as $ 1 a gallon in some areas. Heating oil futures climbed 1.75 cents to 10.74 cents with January settling at 92.48 cents a gallon; crude oil settled 53 cents to 63 cents higher with February at $ 21.91 a barrel; unleaded gasoline was 1.9 cents to 5.49 cents higher with January at 60.94 cents a gallon. Coffee futures climbed above 80 cents a pound for the first time since Oct. 2 on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid reports of a weekend freeze in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s coffee-growing region. Coffee settled 4.18 cents to 4.5 cents higher with March at 82.67 a pound. Cotton futures rose sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on a combination of technical factors and rumors that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had purchased a large amount of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani cotton. Cotton settled 1.13 cents to the limit 2 cents higher with March at 70.71 cents a pound. The easing of tensions in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> prompted a sell-off of precious-metals futures on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold futures finished $ 6.40 to $ 6.70 lower with December at $ 406.80 a troy ounce; silver was 4.8 cents to 5 cents lower with December at $ 5.512 a troy ounce. Live cattle settled .33 cent to .95 cent higher with February at 77.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .48 cent higher with January at 85.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .18 cent to .53 cent higher with February at 49.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .70 cent higher with February at 49.77 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures moved modestly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as temperatures in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> growing areas rose, slowing feed-grain demand and easing transportation problems. Wheat futures settled 1 -LCB- cents to 1 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 4.10 a bushel; corn futures were -LCB- cent to 1 \ cents lower with March at $ 2.38 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 \ cents to 1 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 1.53 a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents to 3 -RCB- cents lower with January at $ 5.68 -LCB- a

 Prices closed narrowly mixed on Wall Street Tuesday as rising oil prices triggered concerns about inflation and interest rates. Stocks tracked the credit markets for much of the session, declining in early trading as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> prices slumped. Wall Street later shook off the drop in bonds and moved moderately higher, but in late afternoon the credit markets continued to fall in response to a surge in oil prices and stocks gave up their gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed 2.13 lower at 2,709.26 after rising as high as 2,728.88 earlier in the day. Advancing issues were slightly ahead decliners in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 712 up, 664 down and 552 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to a slim 77.61 million shares, down from 120.98 million in the previous session. Many traders were extending their Christmas holiday weekend. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 99.09 million shares. Treasury prices skidded first because of an increase in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s discount rate, which raised the specter of interest rates rising in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to keep up with Japanese yields Bonds continued to drop in later trading because of a surge in oil prices after several oil companies reported refinery shutdowns. Rising energy prices are considered a harbinger of higher inflation and, in turn, higher interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is less likely to relax credit and allow interest rates to drop when inflation is accelerating.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday announced a voluntary recall of more than 36,000 Aerostar vans and Ranger trucks, citing possible brake or throttle defects. The automaker said it is notifying owners of about 32,000 1990-model Aerostars that the vans' master brake cylinders may malfunction. In weather colder than 40 degrees, a seal in the master cylinder could lose its effectiveness, which could cause excessive brake pedal travel and increased stopping distances, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. But there is no chance that the brakes could fail due to the problem, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle-Farrell </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also is notifying owners of 4,355 1990-model <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> with 4.0-liter engines that throttles may stick. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> knows of no accidents or injuries that have occurred because of the possible problems, <PERSON> Doyle-Farrell </PERSON> said. Of the affected vehicles, an estimated 855 have been delivered; the rest are being held at dealers or are in transit to dealers. Owners are being notified of the voluntary recall by mail and are being asked to return the vehicles to their dealers to have corrective work performed at no cost.

 <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, will resign his CEO position when a replacement is found, the troubled bank said in a statement Tuesday. Asked if this meant <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> will stay on as chairman, <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a bank spokeswoman, said only `` the word of the release is as it stands.'' She acknowledged `` there is an ambiguity'' about the wording regarding <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>'s future position with the bank. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> also announced Tuesday it had designated the executive committee of its board of directors and three special board committees to examine key structural aspects of its business and operations. Since the bank's troubles began, federal banking regulators have increased scrutiny of its operations. Financial analysts had speculated that a major reshuffling of the bank's top management was forthcoming. `` It's certainly been rumored around <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that he -LRB- <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> -RRB- might step aside,'' said <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stangle </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, who works out of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` I guess for that reason it did n't come as a surprise.'' The announcement came after the stock market closed Tuesday. Bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was the most active issue on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with more than 2.2 million shares changing hands. The shares fell 12.5 cents to close at $ 7.37 -LCB-. <PERSON> Stangle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> has been a driving force at the bank. `` He's a very strong-willed guy that has run the institution for the past 10 years or so,'' he said, adding it was unclear who would take his place as chief executive. The bank's board appointed a committee to begin a search for candidates to succeed <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, who said he would resign his post as chief executive when a replacement is found, the company said in a statement. The statement said <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> will continue working with another board committee on further expense reductions, financial matters and other improvements in operations. In another sign of its financial difficulties, the bank on Friday rescinded its common stock dividend of 34 cents a share for the fourth quarter. Earlier this month, the bank said it would boost its loan reserves above $ 1 billion and that it expected a `` substantial'' loss for the year. The new special committees are `` designed to assure that the problems faced by the organization as a result of the unprecedented developments in the real estate market are addressed in a timely and comprehensive manner,'' the statement said. The special committees, made up of non-management board members, would work closely with the corporation's management and the bank regulatory agencies, the company said. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulmer </PERSON>, the company's president, was named to begin an effort to address all aspects of the real estate loan portfolio of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>'s banking subsidiaries in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. He was charged to report to the executive committee of the company's board, assisted by the board's special advisor, Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Secura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> Industry analysts said the move reflected the serious trouble <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> faces due to a real estate slump that affected a number of other banks in the region. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> also said Tuesday it is continuing to work with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to explore possible asset sales or mergers. A special board committee has been named to oversee this effort, the company said. Separately Tuesday, an investor group that includes <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chief Executive <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said it holds a 6.6 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s largest bank In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the group said it acquired the 4.7 million shares for investment purposes only. It paid $ 94.5 million for them.

 <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will pay <ORGANIZATION> Transamerican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> $ 300 million to settle a lawsuit stemming from a gas purchase dispute involving jointly owned properties in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, a pipeline company owned by <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said it will pay Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Transamerican </ORGANIZATION> plus turn over oil and gas mineral interests on the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Zapata </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> estimated have a current market value of $ 90 million to $ 110 million. The agreement settles a lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Transamerican </ORGANIZATION> over a `` take-or-pay'' contract with <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. Under such contracts, purchasers agree to pay a supplier for natural gas, whether or not they take immediate delivery. <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McFall </PERSON> said a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> jury ruled in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Transamerican </ORGANIZATION> in April 1988. The initial judgment of $ 602 million plus attorney fees and court costs eventually was reduced to $ 480 million. The agreement terminates all gas purchases and related arrangements with <ORGANIZATION> Transamerican </ORGANIZATION> and requires the dismissal of lawsuits now pending before a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state appellate court. <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> said it expects the settlement to be implemented Jan. 31 after certain government clearances. The company said it will seek to recover 75 percent of the settlement through its pipeline rates. <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> is the former energy unit of <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which was spun off as a separate company last year.
