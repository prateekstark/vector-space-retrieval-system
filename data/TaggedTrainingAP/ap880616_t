<BYLINE>Opposition Leader Balks At Decree On Islamic Law</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition leader <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> assailed President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> for his decree making Islam the law of the land and accusing him of doing it to stay in power, newspapers reported Thursday. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> put the so-called Shariah Law into effect Wednesday night in a televised address to the nation. He said his decree makes Islam `` the supreme law of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'' but will not affect the rights of non-Moslems or <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s business contracts with other nations. The official <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper trumpeted `` Shariat At Last'' on page one. A report in the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION>, however, quoted Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> as telling Pakistani journalists at a Wednesday reception that her archfoe <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> had `` no right to impose his will on the people of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.'' Other newspapers carried similar accounts. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying: `` It has been the <ORGANIZATION> PPP </ORGANIZATION>'s stand that <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, like in the past, is again being used to perpetuate oppressive rule.'' Gen. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, who also is chief of the army, surprised the nation on May 29 by firing his entire civilian government and dissolving the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. He claimed that in three years in power, they failed to enact the Islamic code and to battle deteriorating law and order. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> hinted that elections would be announced within 90 days but he has yet to set a date. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ousted Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> bhutto, in a 1977 military coup and had him hanged two years later for complicity in a murder plot. After ruling eight years with martial law, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> allowed creation of a civilian government in 1985. The opposition press dubbed his firing of that government `` <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s second coup d'etat.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> had cautiously welcomed the prospect of new elections after having boycotted the 1985 voting, but she lashed out at <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s latest move as an abuse of power `` We believe it is not the business of a caretaker government or an individual to impose their views on the nation,'' she was quoted as saying. `` As in the past, we will resist any such move.'' She repeated her call for free elections and denied reports that her advancing pregnancy would keep her from preaching the party's platform of popular socialism She married <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Asif </PERSON> <PERSON> Zardari </PERSON> last December and at 35, is expecting her first child this December. `` We would like constitutional continuity which calls for elections within 90 days. If you break this continuity, it would amount to opening a Pandora's box,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was quoted as saying.

 Hackers penetrated a non-classified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> computer network last month, rummaging through data at a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, and at least one other center, the space agency said Thursday. The break-in occurred the night of May 16 and lasted into the early morning hours of May 17, but no damage was done, said <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, the laboratory's manager of communications and computing network services. `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> security people are working with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigating the details of this,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> told a news conference. It was unknown whether more than one person was involved or if the break-in was achieved from inside or outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. Unauthorized computer access is illegal, he added. Thousands of computers are linked to the network at hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign universities and research centers, including military research centers and other <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> offices, he said. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> described it as a non-classified network for sharing scientific information. The network, named ARPANET, is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. He said he considered the incident serious because programs used to design microcircuits could have been damaged and because `` if someone burglarizes my house, I'm offended. If someone accesses my computer, I'm equally offended.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> regards as serious any attempt to gain unauthorized access to its computer systems,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Let me assure you, however, that there is no indication that any classified information has been obtained by such hacker activity.'' The break-in was the third known violation of computer security at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in two years, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. He cited a previously publicized August 1986 break-in by a West German hacker, or computer buff, and another last summer, in which the perpetrator was caught but not prosecuted. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said the hacker in last month's incident first gained access to the Pentagon network through another computer at an undisclosed location. Once inside, the hacker guessed a password _ the name of a <ORGANIZATION> JPL </ORGANIZATION> employee _ to enter the lab's computer, he added. The hacker then used the <ORGANIZATION> JPL </ORGANIZATION> computer as a conduit to enter another ARPANET computer at <LOCATION> Patuxent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, where authorities noticed something was amiss and notified the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. He added that he did n't know how many other computers also were penetrated. The lab's chief spokesman, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, initially said members of the <ORGANIZATION> Chaos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, broke into the <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> computer at the laboratory, but he later retracted the statement. `` We do n't know for a fact that it was Chaos. ... There are things that make us suspicious, but the bottom line fact is we do n't know,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said. `` They're not kids,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said of the club's members. `` They're adults. They are a worrisome group to American computer experts. They're not just hackers doing pranks. They are group whose motives and aims are not entirely clear.'' A spokesman for the club told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, that he was unaware of the break-in, but would check into the matter further. `` One thing I can tell you with absolute certainty is they -LRB- the hackers -RRB- did n't get into any classified data banks nor did they get into any sensitive information in the lab,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said that as soon as the break-in was discovered, `` we pulled <ORGANIZATION> JPL </ORGANIZATION> out of the network.'' Several days after the break-in, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> JPL </ORGANIZATION> officials `` rebuilt the system to make sure that if they -LRB- hackers -RRB- planted any viruses, we were not going to continue using the operating system they had been mucking around with,'' he said. A computer virus is a program surreptitiously inserted into a computer to disrupt its normal program. In April, a West German prosecutor revealed that a 24-year-old West German hacker linked his home computer to about 50 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military computers by telephone. The electronic break-ins were detected in August 1986. Targets included computers at <ORGANIZATION> JPL </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and at the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. In September, members of <ORGANIZATION> Chaos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> announced that youths who were n't club members used home computers to break into a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> computer information network used by at least nine nations, and that they obtained secrets about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program. The club said the hackers gained regular access to at least 20 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> computers between May and September 1987 through a flaw in the security system. At the time, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> denied that secret information had been obtained through its computer network.

 Five Costa Rican fishermen drifted 3,600 miles in five months after their boat ran out of fuel, surviving on rainwater and fish until their rescue 700 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` We ate anything that came near our boat, such as fish, turtles and sharks,'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, one of the fishermen, told the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` We got water because it rained a few days and we managed to fill a lot of empty cans we had on board our boat.'' The Kinei Maru 128, a Japanese tuna boat, spotted the 30-foot Cadiro 3 adrift 700 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The tuna boat rescued the men and left the Cadiro 3 drifting, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawley </PERSON>. The Cadiro 3 set out Jan. 19 from <LOCATION> Puntarenas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, for an eight-day fishing trip, he said. `` A storm came upon us so we started heading for shore, but the winds were too strong and they pulled us out to sea,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` We ran out of deisel and have been adrift ever since then.'' <PERSON> Crawley </PERSON> said as the boat drifted across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, the men ate anything they could catch. `` We survived by throwing over bait which we had for our fishing trip,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Crawley </PERSON> said the fishermen communicated with the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> via the tuna boat's radio. All five were reported in good conditon. <PERSON> Crawley </PERSON> identified the other sailors as captain <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obregon </PERSON> <PERSON> Orando </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, Pastor <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cernas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolivar </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 People infected with the AIDS virus show no sign of mental problems until they develop physical symptoms associated with the deadly disease, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government study shows. `` We're not seeing any difference whatsoever in terms of a number of psychological measures known to be sensitive to virtually any form of brain damage,'' said one of the study's authors, Dr. <PERSON> Ola </PERSON> <PERSON> Selnes </PERSON>, a psychologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. He presented the findings Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS. Also at the meeting, Dr. <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Salk </PERSON>, the polio vaccine pioneer, described his first efforts toward an AIDS vaccine. In a separate report, Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagury </PERSON>, the daring French scientist who in 1986 injected himself with an experimental AIDS vaccine of his own devising, said that with booster shots he has developed antibodies that might be capable of destroying the AIDS virus. And in a study of the distribution of clean needles and syringes to drug addicts in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, researchers said they found that such a program does not encourage drug abuse and may well reduce the transmission of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child at or before birth. The study by <PERSON> Selnes </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON>, also of <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, was intended to resolve questions raised by earlier studies that had found distinct mental problems, such as loss of memory and mental slowness, in people infected with the AIDS virus. Those changes sometimes seemed to appear before any other signs of AIDS infection. As a result, concern was expressed that people in sensitive jobs, such as airline pilots, nuclear reactor operators or operators of heavy industrial equipment, should be removed from their positions if they become infected with the AIDS virus, even if they are not outwardly sick. `` Based on our results, we do not feel there is any cause for alarm or concern,'' <PERSON> Selnes </PERSON> said. The study was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases. The debate involves whether mental problems appear early in the course of infection, before other diseases strike. There is general agreement that about 70 percent of those who die of AIDS have significant mental and neurological problems after other symptoms develop, according to a report released in March by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. That report concluded that there was no evidence for mental or neurological problems in otherwise healthy people infected with the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Selnes </PERSON> and <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON> followed 201 people for two years. Eighty-two were uninfected with the AIDS virus, 88 had been infected for a long time and 31 had been infected for a relatively brief period. The patients were examined every six months with a variety of psychological tests, and no differences were seen between the infected and uninfected subjects, <PERSON> Selnes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Salk </PERSON> said in a report on his vaccine research that he has completed the first human trials of an unusual vaccine intended to keep infected people from developing AIDS. He said he had given the vaccine to nine men with ARC, or AIDS-related complex, an AIDS-like disease that can progress to AIDS. The vaccine appears safe, he said. It also appears to raise levels of immune system cells, and in one of the subjects the virus seemed to disappear completely. That has persuaded <PERSON> Salk </PERSON> to continue trials with 54 AIDS-infected people who have not yet developed AIDS or ARC. In a separate report, Zagury, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> scientist, said his administration of an experimental vaccine to himself in 1986 had enhanced his body's production of antibodies against the AIDS virus. The vaccine consisted of a specially modified smallpox virus containing a portion of the AIDS virus. He gave himself booster shots of his own blood cells, which he had extracted and infected with the same type of modified virus before reinjecting them. He said his body has produced high levels of AIDS antibodies, some of which may be capable of neutralizing the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Buning </PERSON>, a psychologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Amsterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said that four years of providing clean syringes and needles to drug addicts in the Dutch city has produced a significant drop in needle sharing and may have helped curb AIDS spread. The needle exchange program gave health workers an opportunity to tell addicts how to lower their AIDS risk, and that counselling was a critical component of the exchange program, said <PERSON> Buning </PERSON>. `` Our conclusion is that the needle and syringe exchange helps addicts to use drugs safely,'' he said. Furthermore, he said, the program did not lead to increased drug use, as critics of such programs had feared. The first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> needle exchange program will begin soon in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, under the sponsorship of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for AIDS Research.

 Amid all the hoopla over <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Dundee </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rambo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Willow </PERSON> <PERSON> Ufgood </PERSON> and other heroes of the new film season, the infamous <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> might be overlooked. Not by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. `` ` Friday the 13th' is a gold mine that keeps on rolling along,'' declares <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganis </PERSON>, president of worldwide marketing for Paramount. The studio reports that the first six films in the series have grossed over $ 172 million, not to mention the big videocassette sales, cable TV, syndication and a TV series. In its first 18 days, `` Friday the 13th Part VII _ The New Blood'' sold almost $ 16 million worth of tickets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Since the film cost $ 3.5 million _ about 1\18th the budget of `` Rambo III'' _ it should already be solidly in the black. `` Part VII'' profited by premiering on Friday the 13th of May; the series always does better business when released on that fateful day. `` <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> has become part of the vernacular,'' <PERSON> Ganis </PERSON> said. `` Why? I think because he is genuinely frightening, and teen-agers genuinely love to be frightened. My own daughter loved ` Friday the 13th III.' Now she has seen ` VII' and then she goes to see -LRB- the more arty -RRB- ` The Moderns.' A whole generation has grown up on <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> and keeps going back.'' <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> began his rampageous career quite modestly in 1980, in a low-budget thriller created by producer-director <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>. Ironically, <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> devised the title when he was planning a children's television show. He figured it might work for the title of a feature film, and he was right. `` Friday the 13th'' grossed an amazing $ 40 million. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, who is now filming another horror film, `` Deep Six,'' signed over his rights to <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>, and the series has had five other directors. The formula remains the same as in the original, which starred <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, later of `` Footloose'' fame, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>, son of <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> as <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s mother. The action _ lots of it _ always takes place at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> returns from the dead, wearing a hockey mask and wielding an ax to pay back a grudge. Many years ago when he was a camper he drowned in the lake because his inattentive counselors were making love in the bushes. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s vengeance is wreaked upon the human race in general, with special emphasis on oversexed counselors. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Buechler </PERSON>, a special effects expert who became a director -LRB- `` Troll,'' `` Cellar Dweller'' -RRB-, directed `` Friday the 13th VII'' from a script by <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Haney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Buechler </PERSON> -LRB- pronounced Beekler -RRB- says he saw possibilities of applying two new twists to the same saga. `` One, I thought it would be good to have a main character in the story, someone the audience could cry and cheer for, and follow her through the nightmare world,'' he said. `` She is the teen-ager -LRB- <LOCATION> Lar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> -RRB- whose special powers release <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> from his grave at the bottom of the lake. Telling the story from one person's viewpoint had only been done once before -LRB- in Part V -RRB-. `` Two, I added a substantial element of the supernatural. Before Part VII, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> was a mindless man who jumped out of closets and killed people. Since he was resurrected by electricity in Part VI, he was now, practically speaking, a ghost. That made him a virtually unstoppable humanoid. `` So I thought it would be fun to fill the last two reels with false endings. I wanted the audience to say, ` Oh, he's up, now he's down, he's dead No, he's up again!' My aim was more fantasy than reality.'' Even with the innovations, <PERSON> Buechler </PERSON> was careful not to tamper too much with the `` Friday the 13th'' formula. `` I was hired to satisfy the producers; if I was hired to do a <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> picture, I would certainly follow the Bond formula,'' he said. `` Friday the 13th VII'' inevitably found disfavor with the ratings board of the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which immediately branded the film with an X for extreme <PERSON> gore </PERSON>. This would have made the movie unsalable since a film rated X prevents anyone under age 17 from being admitted to the theater. Like <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, though, the filmmakers kept coming back again and again with new cuts. `` They gave us an X six times until we finally got an R,'' <PERSON> Buechler </PERSON> said. `` I understand ` Robocop' holds the record at eight.'' Stunt man <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodder </PERSON> is the seventh portrayer of <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, which might seem a thankless acting job since he does n't speak and is hidden behind a mask. <PERSON> Hodder </PERSON> does n't agree. `` I've always wanted to play that character ever since the first film,'' says <PERSON> Hodder </PERSON>, who has coordinated stunts for `` House,'' `` Ghost Town'' and other thrillers. `` I've always believed that he should be played by a stunt man. `` I think <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> is more of a challenge because he has no dialogue. I tried to get across the feeling of menace just by using certain head movements and body movements.'' If the `` Friday the 13th'' films are stiumlating to teen-agers, they are an ordeal for reviewers, whose vituperation has no apparent effect on the audience. `` Critics hate the movies,'' <PERSON> Buechler </PERSON> said, `` but surprisingly, we've had mixed reviews on VII. The common pattern is for the reviewer to comment that <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> is here to stay, then to review the previous one in the series and conclude, ` If you liked them, you'll like this one.'

 What a groovy guy that <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Voorhees </PERSON> is _ ahead of his time with that goalie mask fashion look, and ever so creative with axes, knives and spears. He's a real human slice-and-dice machine, but not not too many people like him. Still, they flock to see his movies _ seven so far _ and he does n't even have a speaking part. Here's a look at <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s life and death and life and death in the `` Friday the 13th'' sagas:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ `` Friday the 13th'' -LRB- 1980 -RRB-: Six frisky camp counselors reopen <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, which has been closed for over two decades after a rash of unsolved murders. A seventh, who hitchhikes to the camp, never quite makes it: She's turned into a forest pizza The other college-age dimwits romp about until they, too, are carved into human kindling. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, the last of the lot, runs into Mrs. <PERSON> Voorhees </PERSON> who lives nearby. She promises to drive the hysterical girl to safety but instead talks about her son, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, who drowned years ago while his counselors made love in the woods. She turns on <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> with a hatchet; <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> finally decapitates the madwoman and makes her way to a canoe which drifts to the middle of the lake. In a blink, the drowned <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> reaches up from his watery hell and grabs her. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> abruptly awakens in a hospital room to be told by police that <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s body was never found. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> says: `` Then he's still there.''

The camp leader, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, talks about <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> _ an icon by now _ and says he's really alive, living off wild animals and waiting to avenge his mother's death. One by one, and two by two the randy counselors-to-be encounter <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, who enthusiastically dispatches his victims with a curved machete, a spear thrust through two bodies, a hammer. Finally, only <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and his girlfriend, <PERSON> Ginny </PERSON>, are left. Thinking <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> dead, <PERSON> Ginny </PERSON> tries to flee. She ends up at <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s cabin where she finds a shrine to his dead mother containing her decapitated head. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> shows up, struggles with <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Ginny </PERSON> slices up the `` dead'' boy's body with the machete. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ginny </PERSON> return to the cabin, and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> crashes through the window. <PERSON> Ginny </PERSON> wakes up in an ambulance. `` Where's <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>?'' she asks.

 _ `` Friday the 13th Part 3 _ 3-D'' -LRB- 1982 -RRB-: Yet another group of idiots heads for the lake, amid newscasts of mass murders. Three bikers show up to taunt them and are promptly dispatched by our <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, who picks off the vacationing college kids with his usual finesse: He shoots an arrow through a head, cleaves a body, electrocutes one guy, slits a neck, thrusts a hot fireplace poker through a chest. As usual, one hysterical female is left, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>. After a struggle, she imbeds an ax in <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s head, runs to the lake and paddles a canoe to the center _ silly girl. When she awakens in the morning, Mrs. <PERSON> Vorhees </PERSON>' body, dripping with rotted flesh, explodes from the water and pulls <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> under. Police take a deranged <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> away and we catch one last -LRB-? -RRB- glimpse of <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, the ax still rooted in his skull, his fingers twitching.

 _ `` Friday the 13th _ The Final Chapter'' -LRB- 1984 -RRB-: Ten people have been slaughtered at <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> also lies dead. The bodies are taken to the morgue where <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, perky as ever, rises up, slits the throat of an attendant and guts a nurse. Back at the lake, Mrs. <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> and her two children, <PERSON> Trish </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>, are in their summer home. A group of teen-agers has moved in next door. The party's soon over, though, as they're harpooned, crucified, hacksawed and otherwise minced. But <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> is a horror freak who has a makeup collection, masks and clippings about <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. He saves his sister and himself by putting on a hockey mask, confusing <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> and grabbing the machete. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> whacks his personal hero again, and again and again.

 _ `` Friday the 13th _ A New Beginning'' -LRB- 1985 -RRB-: <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> is now 18 and has nightmares about <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. He lives at a halfway house after being released from a mental institution. Then the murders begin with axes, hunting knives and hedge shears as the weapons du jour. Finally, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> comes face to face with <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> who falls from a hayloft onto the steel spike teeth of a tractor harrow. Rain washes away makeup from the corpse's face and reveals the killer as a paramedic pretending to be <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>, who still has nightmares, is back in the hospital. He smiles knowingly, pulls a hockey mask from his bureau, hides behind the door and waits.

 It's not exactly a role actors would kill for, but kill indeed they do. Seven men have portrayed <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Voorhees </PERSON>, the masked and multilated corpse who refuses to stay dead in the seven `` Friday the 13th'' movies. The Jasons have ranged from a professional trapeze artist to a nightclub manager who had no acting experience: 1. <PERSON> Ari </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> was 14 when he launched <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s blood binge in `` Friday the 13th.'' In the movie that made sequels a thriving business, he's only seen in two scenes: a flashback when <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> drowns as a child in <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, and at the end of the film when his rotting corpse rises from the lake to grab the lone survivor of his mother's murder rampage. Now in his 20s, <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> has left acting and plays with a funk-rock band. 2. <ORGANIZATION> Warrington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, the evil killer in `` Part 2,'' majored in economics at <ORGANIZATION> Villanova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He studied acting with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasberg </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before going to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> where he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He's worked in comedy workshops, did a movie documentary on <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and has appeared on the TV soap opera, `` General Hospital.'' 3. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> in the 3D version, is a professional trapeze artist who has appeared in cirucuses throughout the world. He also does high wire, juggles and works on the trampoline. He studied acting at such theater companies as The Stage and <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Studio </LOCATION> and has appeared in commercials. 4. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a stunt man and actor who played <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> in `` Part IV,'' had never seen a `` Friday the 13th'' movie. His credits include `` The Creature From the Black Lagoon.'' 5. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieand </PERSON>, who plays a paramedic posing as <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> in `` Part V,'' does soap operas and commercials. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, he talked about his audition for the part: `` The director told me to stare at an empty desk and react as if I saw my son laying there hacked to bits.'' 6. <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who managed a nightclub, was the sixth <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. He got the part after portraying <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> for a club performance by an illusionist who was a friend of the company that did special effects for the `` Friday the 13th'' movies. He suggested <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who had no acting experience, as the next <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. 7. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodder </PERSON>, a stunt coordinator, stunt man and actor, has performed stunts in over 25 movies and more than 40 TV shows. He might be the last <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, but who knows?

 Sitting in his tiny store-front office just down the street from the sprawling grounds of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> predicted he would soon regain control of the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` God does n't take you halfway and dump you,'' said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who resigned from the television ministry last year in the wake of a sex scandal and is under investigation by a federal grand jury. `` I've been building this place for 15 years. I'm staying until I get it back.'' Even the ever-optimistic <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> admitted it will be an uphill climb for him and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, to get back PTL. They intend to present a reorganization plan for the Christian retreat in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, before June 29. `` We are also placing an advertisement in a local newspaper asking all former employees who are interested in being a part of the <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> ministry to come to the office and fill out a form,'' he said Wednesday. `` These are not job applications; it's just a survey to see how many are interested. Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has already told <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> officials to sell land, buildings and other assets to raise enough money to settle claims against the ministry that could reach $ 130 million. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> officials worked out a deal with businessman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinn </PERSON> calling for <PERSON> Shinn </PERSON> to buy all or most of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s property at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and lease parts of the ministry to a new church. <PERSON> Shinn </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> franchise and a minor league baseball team, has declined to say how much he will offer for the complex. Estimates have ranged from $ 75 million to $ 100 million. M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, the court-appointed trustee at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, has said there are several other offers and vowed to treat any proposal from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> fairly. `` I'm more convinced at this moment that we will be back at <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> than at any time in nearly a year and a half,'' said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, adding that he hopes to buy some television time to promote his plan. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in early June and opened an office in a shopping mall next door to the headquarters of the `` Bring Back Bakkers'' club. `` I've yet to meet a negative person,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said in an interview Monday in his office decorated with photographs of him and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>. `` We came here psychologically prepared for battle. But people have been coming up to us in the restaurants and on the street to give us their support.'' Since his return, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said, a car dealer gave him a new car and other offers have been made. `` They told me they only have one question, ` What can we do to get <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> back?''' he said. `` Never before have I had such an outward expression of support from local business people.'' Not all business owners share that sentiment. `` There's still too much of a bad taste in people's mouths,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Haney </PERSON>, who owns a small leather shop across the street from <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. Several blocks away, <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who operates a craft shop, said, `` I do n't think <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> can make it work. So many people are so disgusted. I'm the first to forgive, but ...'' At <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the impact of the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' departure is apparent. The water slide is closed. Shuttle buses that transport visitors to the various attractions are nearly empty. Main Street, a collection of shops and restaurants, looks like a ghost town. The park's nearly 1,500 employees of a year ago have been cut by nearly two-thirds, to just over 500. `` The mood around here used to be a three-ring circus. Now it's like a cemetery,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Crisp </PERSON>, who has been coming to <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Lenoir </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, with her husband for six years Still, she does n't know if she wants the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> back. `` Everyone is deserving of a second chance, but they have to come back truly repentant,'' she said. `` The thing that disturbs me is when <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> said, ` What did we do wrong?' That boggles my mind. What about the credit cards and selling Heritage three times over?'' The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> also have their fervent supporters. `` No one can run this place like <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, who stopped by during a break from job hunting. `` If God can forgive him, I can.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> declined to give details of his reorganization plan, and he wo n't identify any financial backers. `` We'll present a conservative plan without any pie-in-the-sky deals,'' he said. `` It's built on our track record of the past. I plan to restore it to where I left it and go beyond. `` I think we can help people because of what we've been through,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` They want to know, ` Does the Bible really work?' We've been through one of the most devastating times of just about any public figures in history.''

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government says its campaign to reduce atmospheric pollution is working, but some among <LOCATION> Athen </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million people are not so sure. For years, the capital has been plagued by a brown layer of noxious smoke, exhaust fumes and factory emissions that Athenians call the `` nefos,'' Greek for cloud. On a warm windless day, the `` nefos'' sends an average of 300 Athenians to hospitals complaining of headaches, chest pains, nausea and stinging eyes. `` I drive around <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> all day and when I get home my nose is clogged and my hair is oily from the fumes,'' said <PERSON> Michalis </PERSON> <PERSON> Leontsakos </PERSON>, one of the city's 15,000 taxi drivers. `` And when summer hits, it's much worse.'' Last July a 10-day heatwave compounded the smog problem and more than 1,200 mostly poor and elderly Athenians died of heatstroke or breathing problems. Officials in Prime Minister <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s Socialist government maintain, however, that a new package of anti-smog measures is producing results and that last summer's high temperatures are unlikely to recur. `` The recent package has been particularly productive,'' Environment Minister <PERSON> Evangelos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouloumbis </PERSON> said. `` We have had a 15 to 25 percent reduction in overall pollution levels.'' The smog forms over the mountain-ringed <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> basin on warm, still days. The sun heats up a layer of cold night air close to the ground and the air then rises into the lower atmosphere where it acts as a barrier that traps the warmer pollutants under it. The problem is aggravated by the lack of parks and green spaces in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>' concrete sprawl. The city has just 23 square feet of greenery per resident, compared to 107 square feet in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, 215 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and 290 in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Environmental scientists blame the city's 750,000 cars, diesel-powered taxis, buses and trucks for 75 percent of the smog. `` If you take away half the cars, you'd only have half the problem,'' said <PERSON> Dimitris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadzidakis </PERSON>, a chemical engineer with the state-run pollution control program. `` Traffic would move faster and you'd have few engines idling.'' To cut down on traffic the government abolished <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s traditional split working day with its three-hour midday break Stores now stay open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and the change eliminated two of the city's four rush hours. The new measures also ban half the city's taxis from the five-square mile city center on alternate days and have closed a two-square mile central commercial district to traffic. But despite the government claims, some people who work in the city center say they ca n't see much improvement. `` The nefos seems to be the same and fewer people shop in the afternoon hours because of the heat and smog,'' said <PERSON> Michalis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitos </PERSON>, a shoe store clerk. `` The summer looks like its going to be worse and will definitely cut business.'' Half the city's private cars have been banned from the center on alternate days since 1984. Cars with license plates ending in even numbers drive on even-numbered days and vice versa. `` We think that updated cars burning unleaded gas must gradually replace <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>' current fleet of private automobiles,'' said Environment Minister <PERSON> Kouloumbis </PERSON>. But Greeks complain they ca n't afford to buy new cars because of import taxes that triple the basic price. <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statistics indicate the average private car in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> is 10 years old. The government's 1985 target of a 27 percent pollution reduction by 1990 is still on track, but it may take 20 more years to fully solve the problem, environment officials say. `` The trouble is the city's spreading faster that we can reduce the pollution ... and there are 30,000 more cars on the streets every year,'' said <PERSON> Hadzidakis </PERSON>, the chemical engineer. The government has banned low quality heating fuel and insists that filters be installed on <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>' 120 main industrial plants by the end of this year. But independent environmental researchers say the measures still are n't radical enough. `` To solve the pollution problem, you'd have to remove all industry from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> ... and find some way to make at least 1 million Athenians move at least 30 kilometers -LRB- 19 miles -RRB- out of the city,'' said <PERSON> Panayiotis </PERSON> <PERSON> Christodoulakis </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> on Wednesday gave her best wishes to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> conference on disarmament and gave delegates a new issue to ponder by saying `` abortion has become the greatest destroyer of peace.'' `` I think the world has never needed so much tender love as today,'' she told reporters after she met Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> for a courtesy call. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, 77, works with and is the founder of the international <ORGANIZATION> Missionaries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION>, a religious order in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work to ease the suffering of dying slum dwellers, and is known there as the `` saint of the gutters.'' The small, frail-looking woman, wearing a white cotton shawl and blue-trimmed robe, spoke fiercely against `` the evil of abortion, of destroying children, of neglecting children.'' `` We're fighting abortion by adoption, and we have saved thousands of children from being destroyed, because as you know abortion has become the greatest destroyer of peace because it destroys the child, the gift of God. And it destroys the conscience of the mother, it is actually a double killing.'' When asked if she discussed with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> population control programs, she said she had not. Many anti-abortion activists have criticized the programs, saying them promote abortion as a possible option. `` I think we talked of other things, that we did n't say,'' she replied. Another reporter asked her why the concept of non-violence does not seem to work in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> lived for 21 years and where Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner, carries on the tradition of peaceful civil disobedience today. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> said `` non-violence begins at home,'' adding, `` Our government in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have given us full permission to go to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. And we have a mixture of all nationalities, and I am going to take take with me different nationalities, different colors, and bring there with me the joy of loving.''

 In the end, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appearance at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for a drought briefing was outshone by a career federal meteorologist's description of the trouble spots and how they could worsen Reporters who had been herded into a room to look at the vice president, then herded out, ended up only with a written statement in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared that rain is needed to end the drought plaguing large portions of the country. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and a White House entourage, met Wednesday for about half an hour in the office of <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>. For a while, the placid atmosphere of the old <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> administration building was charged by the swarming of security forces assigned to protect the vice president, who is expected to be the Republican presidential nominee. The main elevators were stopped, and employees were routed far around the sensitized area where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to enter and walk within the building. The department's flock of public affairs specialists scurried and fluttered about. It was an exciting time for almost everyone _ except for reporters looking for news. Reporters, photographers and television technicians were herded into a conference room, or a holding pen, where they were required to put all tape recorders and cameras on the floor and then move outside to a hallway. Dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> security people hovered close while a large German Shepherd was taken into the abandoned holding area to sniff the equipment for bombs or weapons. None was found. After more waiting, the two dozen or so news people were allowed to walk up one flight to <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s outer office. The group was allowed to enter for a `` photo opportunity'' at which the subjects are often asked questions over the clicks and whirrs of cameras. But <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief meteorologist, was explaining a set of yellow-and-red charts to his audience, including <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who were seated on a couch, and <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> and others in the official party. No questions were shouted by reporters while <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> talked. After a few minutes, all news people were sternly ordered out of <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s office. Those who tried to tarry in the area were finally herded downstairs again and lodged behind a yellow tape that represented a security boundary. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> then zipped out <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s front door without enduring a single question from reporters about drought or anything else. In his wake, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left a single-page statement noting that if relief does n't come soon, the corn crop could be in jeopardy. `` Without rain there is the potential for this to be a catastrophe,'' he said, echoing <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s congressional testimony of the day before. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said farmers in 21 states are receiving some form of emergency relief, `` but sad to say, nothing will take the place of rainfall, and we have to be concerned about the plight of the nation's farmers.'' <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> filled in the gaps later, gathering up his charts and leading reporters back into the conference room where he summarized his presentation to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said the West is severely lacking in moisture from reduced snowpack during the winter, which resulted in `` well-below-normal'' reservoir levels in much of the region, including <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Another major problem area is in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, notably in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, he said. And dry areas still persist in the Southeast, which has not yet fully recovered from the 1986 drought. `` The best areas in terms of moisture are the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, up into the central <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> ... in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said. Just in the last two weeks, the drought has expanded into the eastern Corn Belt states of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and `` this is a major concern for us,'' he said. Without substantial rains soon, <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said the Corn Belt drought has a `` potential for deterioration'' of crops. However, he said, `` it simply is too early in the growing season to try to define what that potential is.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Toronto Summit is Reagan's Final Bow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be bidding farewell to summitry next week in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Eight years ago, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went to his first economic summit in <LOCATION> Montebello </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, as an untried figure on the world scene, a former movie actor reading his remarks from cue cards, on the defensive about a huge budget deficit, and espousing economic beliefs that some of his colleagues found dubious if not ridiculous. On Sunday, he leaves <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for his last economic summit. Once again, it will be in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will still be reading from cue cards. He still has the same conservative beliefs. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit has zoomed from $ 78.9 billion in 1981 to an estimated $ 146.7 billion. But this time, it's different. For one thing, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been in office longer than any of the other summit leaders except his staunch ally from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. She and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> will be the only leaders there who were on board in 1981. For another, the president's aides are confident this time of the kind of reception <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will get from his colleagues as he makes what will almost surely be his final bow on the global stage. `` I think they have learned what the rest of the world learned, which was not to underestimate <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' the president's chief spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said `` I'm told that at the first summit, he was regarded as a sort of quaint, amusing character from the past, when he talked about markets and private enterprise and entrepreneurship,'' said Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>. `` Now, at the summits that's all they do _ everybody talks in that framework. `` I hope and believe that there is going to be a recognition on the part of all of the countries there that reliance on free markets and reliance on open societies is the best way to foster economic growth and sound economic development,'' said Secretary of the Treasury <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` This is the message, if I may say so, that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took to the first economic summit in 1981, a message at the time that was greeted with a certain skepticism and perhaps even some derision,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` And now, it is not so greeted, and everybody is pretty much in sync and on board with that concept and I think, hope and believe there will be a further endorsement of that at this summit.'' A European official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition he not be identified, said there is still some skepticism abroad, however, about such things as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tax reduction programs and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget and trade deficits. `` I am sure President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has, since 1981, marked cornerstones on a number of things, but I am also sure we could not afford the kind of policies which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> affords in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the official said. As <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> headed for Montebello eight years ago, one <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide, asking that he not be further identified, said, `` There is a push that we project him as leader of the free world.'' But the aide also indicated a fear that other participants would snipe at the president's economic programs and challenge his influence. A Canadian Press writer said then that the new American chief executive would have to rely on `` his good humor and charm'' to cope with `` the greater international experience and intellect'' of such leaders as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>. Now, as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> prepares to go to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` I think they will see that the man they see in 1988 is the same man they saw in 1980. The difference is what he's done, that he's changed the face of the world In terms of military strength, certainly the strength of focus and purpose of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has been strengthened by the president's commitment to it.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added: `` East-West relations have changed dramatically under the president's leadership. The world economy is so much stronger now than it was in 1980 and 1981. Those three elements of achievement have given <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a whole new stature. `` Because <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is leaving office after so many years, undoubtedly there will be a tribute to him of some kind,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know any specifics planned in terms of organization, but I am sure the discussions and the statements will in some way recognize the leadership that the president has given to the economic summits.''

<HEAD>Bush Says He Would Take Income, Assets of Drug Users</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he endorses a House Republican plan to confiscate 25 percent of the adjusted gross income and net assets of anyone caught possessing illegal substances. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took center stage Wednesday at a House Republican news conference, as he combined his support for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan with a blistering partisan attack that was cheered by dozens of his supporters attending the event. `` I'm sick and tired ... in hearing the Democrats do nothing but tear down and criticize'' the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's attempts to halt drug abuse, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'm talking about <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the last two months.'' The Republican plan also calls for the death penalty for drug kingpins, and it would require that states suspend the driver's license of anyone convicted of using drugs, or face loss of federal highway funding <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, hit back on the drug issue, criticizing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for permitting <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> budget cuts that have idled drug interdiction patrols. `` How can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on drugs when we're cutting <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrols by 55 percent? It's that kind of thing _ one of the reasons I'm running for the presidency,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. In addition to the vice president, administration officials appeared all over the Capitol complex Wednesday to testify on the drug problem. The top <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officer discussed the cuts in his agency's drug patrols. The administration's chief budget official and the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary testified on the need for drug-free workplaces. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told lawmakers that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defense contractors will soon be ordered to provide a drug-free workplace environment for their 3.2 million employees. The hundreds of defense contractors would be required to develop extensive education programs about the dangers of drugs; employees with security clearances could also be required to undergo mandatory drug testing, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. An estimated 3 million workers on Pentagon contracts have security clearances of various types. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> did not say if the testing would be required of all employees with clearances or just those with the more sensitive access clearances. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> testified before an unusual joint meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, also said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration supports efforts to create drug-free workplaces. But he expressed reservations before a House Government Operations subcommittee about legislation designed to bring about that goal. A bill sponsored by committee Chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, would require federal contractors and grantees to establish drug-free workplace policies. Employees would have to observe the policies, and sanctions could be imposed if drug use still occurred in the workplace. The sanctions, which would be applied under due process requirements, include future disbarment of contractors who are frequent violators. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the bill, which in part calls for employers and employees to certify that they are complying with the law, would require `` extensive new paperwork burdens.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, standing with some 50 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans at their news conference, declared the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> package `` better than anything the Democrats are going to dream up.'' Democrats control both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, however, and majority <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> task forces are at work developing their own drug proposals. Answering reporters' questions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he supports the administration's `` zero tolerance'' policy of seizing property when even a small amount of illegal drugs is found. He said, `` If some yacht owner is inconvenienced, it's too damn bad.'' Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that his budget shortfall is $ 103 million. He said the money problem `` is proving to be a serious blow to our operations'' against drug smugglers. `` There is a great hue and cry from members getting on the bandwagon for new omnibus drug legislation to win the war against drugs, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is now considering a package of drug legislation costing $ 2 billion,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutto </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the panel `` I wonder where some of those same people were earlier this year when this subcommittee was trying to get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to find the $ 103 million necessary just to keep the Coast Guard ... afloat.'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said last week that the amount of drugs seized by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has been reduced by about one half since the cutbacks.

<HEAD>Prospects Of Female Running Mate For Dukakis Appear Dim</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 As <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> begins the process of selecting a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, the surest bet in politics is that his choice will be a man. Not even the women who worked so hard four years ago to get <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> on the Democratic ticket expect <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to follow <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s history-making example. `` It certainly is n't the top-of-line discussion it was in 1984,'' said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Howes </PERSON>, a political consultant and director of the non-partisan Women's Vote Project. `` Is that a priority in his campaign this year, or in the party?'' said <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON>, director of the National Women's Political Caucus `` It does n't seem like it.'' So when <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> lawyer who is heading the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> search for a running mate came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to talk vice presidential politics, the big names on his calling list were all male, names like <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. He did pay a call on Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. But now in her second year as a senator, she is on no one's list of vice presidential prospects. Missing from <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>' list was Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, who came close to running for president and is the most credible vice presidential prospect among Democratic women. Three women often are mentioned as potential running mates for Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and former U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>. This is the party that turned its back on the Equal Rights Amendment and demands that its national candidates take strong stands against abortion. Analysts talk of a `` gender gap'' that favors Democrats, the fact that a far higher percentage of women than men support Democratic candidates. Yet, this election year, the likely women vice presidential candidates are Republicans, not Democrats. `` I think the major reason is obvious,'' said <PERSON> Celinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, a senior associated with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a Democratic polling organization. `` There are lots of ways in which the Democrats are turning away from the'84 experience. `` And one of the ways, which I think is incorrect, is they think they would not benefit from nominating a woman as the vice president.'' The ``'84 experience,'' of course, was the fact the Mondale-Ferraro ticket was beaten in 49 of 50 states as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> received an estimated 55 percent of the women's vote. `` I also think,'' said <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> `` there is somewhat of a shortage of women who are both ready and willing. ... Because the Democrats have been out of office for eight years, we do n't have the women in the administrative pipeline.'' That view was echoed by others, including <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Symons </PERSON>, a political consultant who worked on Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s presidential campaign `` There are not enough -LRB- Democratic -RRB- women in the pool,'' she said, because a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president has been filling Cabinet positions the past seven and a half years. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> also cited an ambition factor. She listed Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, along with <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> as Democratic women who have the stature to be vice presidential candidates and said, `` I do n't think they want it. They want to be No. 1, not No. 2.'' <PERSON> Howes </PERSON> said, `` The real goal is to be prepared in the 1990s for a woman to be ready to be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to run for president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to win.''

<HEAD>Court Rules Homosexual Agent May Sue CIA Over Dismissal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> has suffered its first-ever defeat in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and as a result must explain in federal court its 1982 firing of a homosexual spy. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> here called Wednesday's ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> a `` major victory'' in limiting what the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> can do in the name of national security and `` a modest step forward'' for gay rights. `` At the very least, it gives us the opportunity to contend that constitutional rights have been violated,'' <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer who is helping represent the fired spy, called the ruling `` a terrific victory.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> is subject to the rule of law and not above the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution,'' <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said. The court's 6-2 ruling flatly rejected the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's arguments that the 1947 law creating the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> gave the spy agency's director virtually absolute authority to fire employees. A homosexual identified in court documents only by the fictitious name <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> was fired by then-CIA Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> in 1982. The agency claimed <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'s homosexuality was a security threat. <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> had joined the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> as a clerk-typist in 1973 and worked his way up to a covert job as an electronics technician, in which he was rated an excellent agent. In January 1982, he voluntarily told an agency security officer that he was gay. <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> was placed on paid leave pending an investigation, and that May he was told he was being fired `` in the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> told agency officials that his family, neighbors and friends knew he was a homosexual, and that he had never revealed classified information to any unauthorized person. <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'s suit demands that he be reinstated. In other decisions, the court: _ Barred police, by a 6-2 vote in an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> case, from questioning criminal suspects who already have invoked their right to remain silent or get a lawyer's help _ even if the questions center on some other crime _ Provided a victory for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and free-trade advocates by ruling unanimously that the government does not have to place restrictions on imported uranium to help protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers of the nuclear fuel _ Ruled, 7-1, in a case from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that business promoters sometimes must share the liability of deals gone sour _ Said <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> courts may apply that state's laws in a natural gas royalties dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and mineral rights owners from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>

<HEAD>Pirates Said Using Modern Business Techniques To Sell Illegal
Electronics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pirate underworld that holds seminars in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and advertises openly in publications is thriving on sales of illegal decoders to backyard satellite dish owners, according to industry officials. Pirates are using modern business techniques, including the distribution of `` how to'' video tapes, to establish a sales network for the illegal electronics, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instrument </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive, said in testimony submitted Wednesday to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications subcommittee. General Instrument makes the VideoCipher II decoder, whose electronics have become the de facto industry standard. Each of the three dozen or so cable programming services that have scrambled their signals can be decoded by the VideoCipher. Industry leaders estimate that as many as half of the nearly 1 million decoders on the market have been illegally modified. With the illegal decoders, backyard dish owners can avoid subscribing to scrambled programming services like <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Showtime </ORGANIZATION> and other popular cable channels. Instead, they can pick up virtually all channels free. <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> said General Instrument has responded to the piracy with changes in the circuitry of the decoder, a public relations campaign to let dish owners know the penalties for dealing with the illegal electronics and an amnesty program that allowed dish owners to trade in modified units at no cost or legal risk. `` In spite of these efforts, piracy has continued,'' <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> said decoder pirates have held seminars in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> to exchange information, run technology centers to develop new ways to break the system and have tried to buy General Instrument's proprietary chips from suppliers <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION>, said pirates are offering full services to the dealers and telling them the risk of getting caught is low. And pirates are even making house calls, going `` door to door where they see the satellite dishes and offer their services. They will sell entire modified descramblers or modify your own unit at home,'' he said. `` Pirates are so competitive, they have even developed programs and systems to prevent other pirates from pirating from them,'' he said. <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a satellite TV retailer based in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said illegal decoders are costing him business. Dealers can make a $ 1,000 profit on the sale of an illegal decoder, and buyers get a sky full of permanent free programming.

 Drug trafficking still poses a security threat at a top-secret nuclear weapons laboratory in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> where a 1986 undercover drug investigation was abruptly terminated under pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigators say. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., said `` a drug problem continues to exist, a security problem continues to exist'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where highly sensitive research on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars missile defense system is conducted According to staff investigators for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chaired by <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>: _ In April 1987, a <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION> electronics technician with a high-level security clearance was caught with several hundred dollars' worth of illicit drugs The employee, who was working on a classified computer system, admitted trading drugs for sex with a female co-worker. _ In June 1987, a security guard responsible for protecting the laboratory's super-sensitive plutonium facility was arrested for drug possession He was accused of bringing drugs and paraphernalia into his security bunker while on duty and being armed with an automatic weapon. _ Also last summer, another employee with top security clearance who worked in the nuclear chemistry department resigned after he was accused of selling thousands of dollars' worth of cocaine to workers in sensitive areas of the laboratory _ Energy Department and <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION> officials are currently investigating allegations of drug use by `` a professional laboratory employee with access to extremely sensitive classified information. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said these disclosures, following the shutdown of the drug investigation code-named `` Operation Snowstorm'' in September 1986, raise `` serious questions about the integrity of security at our nation's most sensitive nuclear weapons and research facilities.'' Energy Undersecretary <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said officials decided to terminate the investigation `` because it had run for eight months and was apparently not uncovering new productive leads.'' <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said Operation Snowstorm had served its purpose in putting <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> employees on notice that drug use would not be tolerated. He denied <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s charge that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had tried to conceal the aborted investigation from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel. At the end of a day-long hearing Wednesday, <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said he was ordering an audit by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to determine the extent of drug-related thefts of computers and other government property at <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>. `` If they are stealing government property, why would n't they steal government secrets, which are more valuable?'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> asked. Energy Department officials responded that they were conducting their own investigation of the theft problem and were `` aggressively pursuing'' questions of whether the laboratory's security clearances had been compromised by drug trafficking The DOE was accused Wednesday of halting the nine-month drug investigation prematurely, leaving undercover agents unable to pursue leads on 127 <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> employees who were suspected drug dealers or users. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Orsa-DiJamco </PERSON>, a special agent of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, testified that pressure from DOE and laboratory officials to hasten the arrest of an alleged drug trafficking ringleader at <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, prevented her agency from identifying the drug suppliers in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., a subcommittee member, suggested that officials who terminated the drug investigation were fearful of adverse publicity `` It seems to me that this Operation Snowstorm should be called ` Operation Snow Job','' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said. `` It appears that <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> was less interested in cooperating with the DEA than in heeding the concerns of one of its contractors,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said. He was referring to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, which has a government contract to operate the Livermore facility. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, who managed the undercover investigation, testified that many of the drug pushers among <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON>'s 8,500 employees held top-secret `` Q'' security clearances. He said the illicit drugs they were selling included cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine and barbiturates. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, current chief of safeguards and security at <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, as telling staff investigators that if Operation Snowstorm had been allowed to continue, `` we would have to arrest 20 percent of the lab.'' Security agent <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> testified that the volume of illicit drug trafficking at <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION> `` has the potential to endanger national security.'' Undercover agent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Buda </PERSON> told the panel he was `` very flabbergasted'' that the investigation was halted just three days before he received a `` Q'' clearance to penetrate the most sensitive `` green badge'' areas of the laboratory. `` We felt like the kid in front of the candy store,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> police chief who served as consultant to Operation Snowstorm. `` We had the money in our hands and we were ready to go inside and do business,'' <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately that door closed before we could get it,'' <LOCATION> Buda </LOCATION> said. In a Jan. 7, 1987, memorandum obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> quoted Adm. <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, assistant energy secretary for defense programs, as offering the previous July to `` put pressure on <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> to get out of our hair.'' The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> was seeking a delay in the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to halt the drug investigation in late summer of 1986.

<HEAD>Surgical Implantation of False Teeth Becoming More Common</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dental science has developed new techniques and new materials for the surgical implantation of false teeth, but there still is no definitive study on the effectiveness of the procedure, a panel of experts says. A panel of dental experts, meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, released a statement Wednesday in which they said more than 300,000 Americans annually will be receiving surgically implanted false teeth by 1992 and that the number of dentists performing such procedures has increased by 10 times since 1983. But the panel said scientific and statistically precise studies are needed to define the effectiveness of permanently implanted false teeth. The panel said the cost for surgically-installed false teeth is about $ 300 to $ 1,000 per implant and that patients can receive from one to eight implants. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> conference on dental implants, said the surgical installation of teeth can no longer be considered experimental. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the development of new materials and new techniques have led to wider acceptance of implantation by dentists and that the demand for permanent false teeth is increasing among Americans. He said as people tend to live longer, more and more patients are finding that they can not use removable false teeth and are choosing to have permanently-implanted artificial teeth. There are several systems for implanting false teeth in living tissue, but they all basically involve surgically cutting into the bone that normally supports teeth and installing a manmade peg or post to support the false teeth, or to anchor a bridge of false teeth. The <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> panel said that because scientific studies have not been made on methods of implanting false teeth, `` it is not possible to make judgments on the comparative merits of different implant systems.'' Several studies, however, show that dental implants are effective for five to 10 years, the panel's report said. However, the report said that little information is available to evaluate such factors as patient satisfaction, appearance, comfort and the effect of implants on speech and chewing. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the panel also determined that the risks of surgically implanting false teeth include the `` inadvertent'' penetration of a sinus cavity by a dentist drilling in bone to create a socket for the implant. He said other problems include damage to facial nerves and infections that could threaten existing, natural teeth.

 Colossus, billed as the largest captive lowland gorilla, got his first glimpse of another member of his species since infancy, a female on loan for breeding. He apparently liked what he But the match between the 6-foot-2, 570-pound Colossus and 4-8, 274-pound Muke, on loan from the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>, has a long way to go before it becomes an affair of the soap opera kind. Colossus' encounter with <PERSON> Muke </PERSON> on Wednesday was only a glimpse through a small opening between their bedrooms at The Zoo in this <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> suburb. `` Colossus has been peeking in through that little porthole over there and been knocking the dust out of the concrete walls,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, director of The Zoo. `` He's very excited about this whole affair.'' Both gorillas are about 22 years old, prime breeding age, and each was captured in the wilds of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as an infant. But Colossus had been separated from other gorillas at <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>'s Animal Park in <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, before moving to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> in March <PERSON> Muke </PERSON> -LRB- pronounced Moo' - key -RRB- has lived with other members of their species at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> scientists had been preparing Colossus for <PERSON> Muke </PERSON>'s arrival by showing him National Geographic videotapes of gorillas. <PERSON> Muke </PERSON> is worldly and sophisticated compared to Colossus, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. She also has an ornery streak, picking fights even with some male gorillas, and is said to have bitten off a keeper's finger at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> zoo, he said. Although considered large for a female, <PERSON> Muke </PERSON> may have met her match in Colossus. She watched him cautiously through the peephole in the door dividing their quarters, especially when Colossus ran over and banged on it. `` She's concerned, I think, about his size,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. `` He's the <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> of the gorilla world Hopefully, he'll be the Bing Crosby of the gorilla world.'' And <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> was n't referring to <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>'s crooning ability, although Colossus has been very vocal since <PERSON> Muke </PERSON>'s arrival Tuesday night. <PERSON> Muke </PERSON> was driven to <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> in a well-vented trailer, stopping at Burger King restaurants en route for fruit and vegetable snacks, but no hamburgers since gorillas are vegetarians. The restaurant chain sponsored the $ 10,000, 1 -LCB- - day-long trip Dr. <PERSON> Mabon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> veterinarian who examined <PERSON> Muke </PERSON> when she was tranquilized before the move, said the animal appears normal in every respect, but for some reason has been unable to breed. The <ORGANIZATION> Gorilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Species </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoos </ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums, which arranged the match, is hoping Colossus will be the answer to her dreams. Because Colossus has no experience with another gorilla, the two will be kept in separate indoor quarters while time-sharing a 7,000-foot outdoor enclosure until they show signs of compatibility. Until then, they will be able to see, smell and touch each other through the peephole. It is n't big enough, however, to permit them to grab or hold hands. `` He's been a peeping gorilla today,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> quipped. Eventually the plan is to open a door enough for <PERSON> Muke </PERSON> to visit Colossus, but not enough for him to crawl through, leaving her with an escape route if necessary. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> figures he'll be able to tell when they are ready to meet when they start knocking the paint off the walls. A more subtle indication, he said, would be the sharing of food.

 The government closed a TV station and a radio station after they ran an interview with a major drug dealer who said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> traffic narcotics. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Palenque </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitana </ORGANIZATION> in the Bolivian capital, said he will begin a hunger strike to oppose the one-year ban imposed Wednesday. <LOCATION> Palenque </LOCATION> interviewed convicted cocaine trafficker <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, his son, and three other guests on a talk show last week. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> is one of the top cocaine traffickers in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. In the show, <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was the `` king of cocaine.'' `` The vice royalty is the government of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and the president is a boss at the service of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government,'' he said. On Monday, the country's conservative government announced it would close the stations for a year and said President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Esstensoro </PERSON> and the government were slandered. The government also ordered the arrest of participants in the show. Despite congressional approval of the act, several legislators expressed concern over the precedent of closing a station through government edict instead of through the courts.

 A woman who was raped, stabbed 15 times, choked and left for dead struggled through desolate countryside nearly 24 hours before she was rescued, and then helped catch the suspect, authorities said. `` She is one tremendous lady,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said Wednesday after the suspect appeared in court. `` This gal has ... courage.'' The 29-year-old <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> woman disappeared from her home about 1:30 a.m. Saturday. She had been talking on the telephone with a friend, who heard the woman cry `` Oh no! Oh no!,'' authorities said. The friend reported hearing sounds of a scuffle, and when police arrived at the home, she was missing. She turned up a day later on a country road northeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, where a motorist picked her up and took her to a hospital, authorities said. Despite her condition, she insisted on giving officers a detailed description of her assailant, <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said. `` Her description was remarkable,'' he said. `` She was trying so hard to help us in the midst of all that pain, sedation and terror.'' The description played a key role in the arrest. Authorities said they were able to identify the suspect with help from a fellow employee who heard the description on the radio. <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON>, 24, of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, was arrested Tuesday night on a rural road 10 miles east of <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, authorities said. He was charged Wednesday with attempted murder, aggravated kidnapping, rape and aggravated assault, and was being held in lieu of $ 250,000 bail. <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON> was paroled in March from the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, where he served part of a 10-year sentence for burglary, sexual assault and intimidation charges filed in Anaconda, <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said. On Saturday, authorities said, <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON> broke into the woman's home through a bedroom window He held her for several hours in an abandoned bus three blocks away, then took her to a remote area northeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, where he raped her, stabbed her 15 times, beat her about the head with a rock and left her for dead in the hilly, rugged area, police said. She made her way through the arid countryside dotted with trees and sagebrush for about 24 hours before she reached the road where she was found, authorities said. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said he did not know how far she traveled. The woman underwent surgery at a <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> hospital Sunday and was in stable condition Wednesday, a hospital spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Painter </PERSON>, who hired <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON> to work at a <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> auto-parts store in April, said <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON> seemed calm Saturday morning at work, but that he suddenly left Tuesday. An employee who heard a description of the assailant on the radio told Painter about the resemblance to <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Painter </PERSON> said he called the sheriff's office. <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON> was arrested minutes later as he was driving to Canyon Ferry Lake with his 17-year-old girlfriend, authorities said. `` You'd never expect it,'' Painter said of <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON>'s arrest. `` It really bothers me. I do n't know what made him tick upstairs.'' Authorities said that an hour before the abduction, the woman had telephoned her husband, who was away in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, and told him of several troubling phone calls she had just received. They also said the suspect had stopped at the woman's home last week to inquire about a `` For Sale'' sign. The woman referred him to a real estate company, authorities said.

 After watching his half-acre of grass wither and dry this spring, <PERSON> Witham </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> wrote a letter to the `` Old Farmer's Almanac.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a regular reader of the almanac, asked whether the 196-year-old publication's forecasters, having missed the Midwest's drought, could at least predict the dry spell's end He received a pretty dry answer from <PERSON> Judson </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, editor of the almanac. `` We did n't predict that it was coming and we ca n't predict when it will end,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who lives in suburban Terrace Park.

This year, it predicted that it would be warmer and wetter than normal in the Greater <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Heavy rain was predicted for June 14 to 17. The almanac usually gathers statistics for its predictions six to 18 months in advance. The predictions are based on such information as changes in sun spots, the size of polar ice caps, and the location of warm water currents. `` Our 1989 edition will be published in November. It is really hard to nail down the weather for spring and summer that far in advance because so many things happen,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. `` They have been a little off before, but never this far,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` They said we would be about half an inch off, but not a drought like this.''

 Senior <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, a founding father of the Jewish state and its leading spokesman for years, has been ousted from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> politics after a generation in its vanguard. The 73-year-old <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, a former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, failed in his bid Wednesday to win a slot on the party slate for the November elections to the Israeli Parliament. Under the Israeli system, each party makes a list of people to fill the seats it wins in the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>. The number of seats assigned to a party depends on its total vote. After the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> vote, <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> wrote to party leader and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>: `` For a generation I carried -LRB- the party's -RRB- flag and stated its case throughout the country and the world, and many listened to me. `` It's clear I can not keep carrying the flag as I did in the past because the party leadership took away my right to do so.'' <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> said he would now dedicate his time to writing books and participating in a television series on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s history. The tall, portly <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> is known for his sophisticated oratory, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s first prime minister, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Gurion </PERSON>, once described him as `` the voice of the Hebrew nation.'' In his 40-year political career, <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> also served as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Referring to his appeal abroad, <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> once said: `` I could have been elected prime minister if people abroad could vote in <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> elections.'' In domestic party politics, <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> never played a central role, partially because his upper-class mannerisms and love of academia set him apart from many of his colleagues. Since 1984, <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> has served as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a position of influence but with little direct power. <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> was born Feb. 2, 1915, in <LOCATION> Capetown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and his family moved to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> when he was a child. He attended <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION>, where he received first class honors in classics, Hebrew, and Arabic and Persian During World War II, he joined the British army. When the war ended, he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the forerunner of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, and was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to help fight for a Jewish state. His skill as a speaker was instrumental in persuading the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to pass the Nov. 29, 1947 Palestine partition resolution that granted the Jews a homeland. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was declared a state a year later. <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>'s ouster Wednesday was in part an apparent payback for his criticism of party leaders for the <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> spy case. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, a 33-year-old American Jew, was sentenced to life in prison in March 1987 for selling classified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military documents to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> made waves in the party last year when a <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> investigating committee he headed blamed <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, a party member, for not supervising those involved in the <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> operation. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was prime minister when <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> was working for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Communists To Participate in Single-Candidate Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> departed from its previous radical stance and said it will participate in a presidential election in which the only candidate will be nominated by the military. The Communists were until now the only major opposition group refusing to participate. They had called for `` all forms of struggle,'' including violence, to put an end to the military regime of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. The Party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that the new position was prompted by `` a new social-political picture in the country'' resulting from the opposition's `` social mobilization and intense political battle.'' But <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leader, said the Communists still will remain excluded from a group of 14 moderate opposition parties united for the vote. According to the 1980 military-drafted Constitution, the election will take place at an unspecified date later this year or early 1989. Citizens will only be able to vote `` yes'' or `` no'' on a candidate to be nominated by the commanders of the three armed services and the head of the national police. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72, who has ruled since a 1973 coup, is considered the most likely candidate. Four Communist leaders said at a news conference that they still think the government will try to win the plebiscite fraudulently and called for labor unrest and street demonstrations. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanfuentes </PERSON>, a party leader, said, `` The victory of the ` no' in the plebiscite should mean an immediate end to the dictatorship and its fascist legislation. He said it should lead to a `` transitional democratic government'' to call an early competitive presidential election. The moderate opposition says a `` no'' victory should be followed by negotiations with the military to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition to full democracy. But the government insists that whatever the vote upcome, the Constitution will remain unchanged. That means if the military-picked candidate is rejected, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> would remain in office for an extra year, until 1990, when an open election would be called.

<HEAD>Government Attacks Foreign Reports On Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chinese police today accused the foreign media of `` sheer fabrications'' in reporting a student sit-in. It was the second attack in a week on foreign accounts of student unrest. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingrong </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, as saying foreign journalists reported students were arrested or beaten by police at sit-in Friday on academic issues. `` Such stories in some foreign media are sheer fabrications,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> as saying. He confirmed that police broke up the protest outside <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a walled compound that houses party headquarters and residences for top leaders. The students were from <LOCATION> Changchun </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Jilin </LOCATION> province. But in a telephone interview, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> refused to give details of how the protest was broken up. No Western reporters saw the brief sit-in. The French news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France-Presse </ORGANIZATION> quoted a witness as saying police led away about 60 protesters, and said police later confirmed the students were taken away. But AFP said it did not report any police beatings of the students, and the target of <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s criticism was not immediately clear. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> radio of falsely reporting a student was arrested in a separate sit-in June 8. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> denied the charge, and said it only reported that one person was led away by police. That sit-in involved about a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students who were trying to hold a pro-democracy protest in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square. Hundreds of students had rallied on campus and planned a march to the square, but police cordoned it off and no march was held. The protest Friday involved students who attended an unaccredited `` special training course'' in <LOCATION> Changchun </LOCATION> and wanted government accreditation for their diplomas, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said. It quoted <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> as saying police stopped the sit-in because `` the students violated the rules for maintaining social order by interfering in the work of the government.'' The incident prompted a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announcement Tuesday calling for a crackdown on unauthorized schools and training classes that lack official accreditation. A growing number of such classes have been set up privately and by work units in recent years, generally to teach English and technical subjects, because of a shortage of places in accredited schools. But their certificates or degrees are not recognized by would-be employers. Officials have made it clear they will not tolerate a repeat of the massive student protests of the winter of 1986-87, when thousands of students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other major cities marched through the streets to demand democracy and freedom. Those protests ended with a crackdown on Western-style liberalism and the ouster by conservatives of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> for failing to halt the protests quickly enough.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> has rejected the transfers of several high-ranking army officers, publicly challenging for the first time the powerful military command that ensured his election. The apparent power struggle began when Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, head of the three-man junta that ran <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> until <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s election in January, ordered the transfers or retirements. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> on Wednesday overruled the orders, claiming they were unconstitutional since he had not been consulted. On Wednesday night, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement pledging loyalty to <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> and delaying the transfer orders. `` It has been decided after a meeting with ... the president and the minister of defense to temporarily put off the above mentioned steps,'' said the statement, broadcast on the private <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION>. `` The transfer and retirement of certain high-ranking officers and other officers decided Tuesday morning by the commander-in-chief'' had been rescinded to `` avoid a major crisis,'' said the statement from the national palace read on local radio stations. It was unclear whether <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> had prevailed. `` The situation is grave,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Either the general submits to <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s ultimatum, or there will be a stand-off between the government and the army There is fear of a clash.'' One of the officers <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> tried to reassign is Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who heads the widely-feared <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> and was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges in March. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inter </LOCATION>, quoting an unidentified military source, said <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> relieved of his command of the 700-man battalion and named assistant chief of staff, a largely administrative position. Soldiers under <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s command have been blamed for widespread violence against voters that forced the cancellation of last November's independently adminstrated general elections and left more than 30 people dead. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, the army's candidate in the Jan. 17 junta-run elections, has always claimed that he could govern independent of the army, which has controlled <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> during most of its 184-year history. A government spokeswoman said Wednesday that everyone was waiting to see what would happen. `` This is certainly a moment of crisis,'' said <PERSON> Anaise </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavenet </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Information. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> scheduled a news conference for this morning. The army's statement, signed by General Secretary of the General Staff Col. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> also said the high command reaffirmed its `` unreserved loyalty to the government of the state within the framework of constitutional and legal provisions.'' <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was head of the three-man junta that ruled <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> for two years after dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled into exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in February 1986. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, a former political science professor, was elected in army-supervised balloting that was boycotted by the opposition that foreign observers said was fraught with fraud. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off most of its aid to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> after the aborted November balloting. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was indicted in March by a grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of conspiring to import 220 pounds of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in December 1986. He has denied the charges. Last week, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>, that his government is ready to open an investigation into <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s alleged drug connection as soon as it officially receives the evidence from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> said details of the charges were delivered to Haitian authorities last week. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, a Social Democrat considered right-of-center and staunchly anti-communist, has done little to alleviate <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s most pressing problems. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, which a population of 6 million, is the poorest country in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. It shares the island of <LOCATION> Hispaniola </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

 A Canadian who lived for a time in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has been charged with espionage for allegedly gathering secrets about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> submarine-monitoring operations for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON>, 25, a native of <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, was charged with three counts of espionage under <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s Official Secrets Act during an appearance in St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s provincial court on Wednesday. Officials have not said whether any information was actually passed to the Soviets. <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON> was ordered held without bail until June 28. He did not have to enter a plea. The suspect said nothing when reporters shouted out questions as he left the courthouse. <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON> was accused of gathering classified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military documents about the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s submarine-tracking base in the <LOCATION> Argentia </LOCATION> naval base during 1987 and 1988. The documents were intended for a foreign power, `` namely the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,'' the charges said. <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON> was arrested last Saturday in St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s following a 2 -LCB- - year investigation by the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Argentia </LOCATION> base, on <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>'s foggy south coast, keeps an eye on Soviet submarines by monitoring a network of underwater listening devices in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The base is jointly operated by up to 400 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel and 70 Canadians. The base commander, Capt. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>, said Tuesday that a member of the base staff cooperated with <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> security agents in investigating <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> would not say whether <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON> approached the base member to seek classified documents or whether he was given doctored documents to pass to the Soviets. <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON>'s mother came from <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. His father was a Hungarian who emigrated to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> cracked down on an anti-Soviet uprising in 1956. After his mother committed suicide <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for a while as a child. Later he returned to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In 1983, he moved back to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> before again moving back to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON> was the fourth person charged under <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s Official Secrets Act since 1950. Only one of the four has been convicted. That was in January 1986, when former <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> pleaded guilty to having passed secrets to the Soviets in 1955.

<HEAD>Southern Baptists Affirm A ``Literal Hell'' For The Lost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People lacking commitment to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> will be consigned to hell, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION> declared, while moderates marched to the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> and tore up a resolution they said meant a denominational dictatorship. `` Some believe that hell is not a reality, and its corollary, that all people will eventually be saved,'' said a resolution approved Wednesday by the nation's largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination at its annual convention. `` We affirm our belief in the biblical truth that those without a personal commitment to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> will be consigned to a literal hell, the place of everlasting separation from God.'' Being saved from it `` comes only by repentence, regeneration through faith in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>,'' the resolution said. `` No one is saved apart from that transforming experience.'' The resolution, approved overwhelmingly, represents no change in doctrine by the 14.7 million-member denomination. But it was unusual since the subject of hell is rarely discussed in most mainstream pulpits or by church conventions because so little is concluded about it. It also seemed to reflect the fundamentalist position that non-Christians must be brought to Christ or be condemned to hell, a thesis that has not been advanced by mainline churches in modern times. A regional interfaith director for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> missions board in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> was ousted earlier this year by fundamentalist pressure because he held that God's covenant with Jews remains permanent and valid. Fundamentalists have held the presidency of the Southern Baptist Convention for nine years. They maintained their grip with the election Tuesday of another fundamentalist, the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who narrowly defeated the moderate candidate, the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, for the one-year term. Through presidential appointive powers, fundamentalists have brought the vast network of denominational operations under their control. The resolution was one of several approved as the annual meeting of 32,600 `` messengers,'' as the delegates are known, neared its close today. With the fundamentalist wing predominating, the convention also limited the historic Protestant concept of the equality of laity and clergy. That view, expressed in the phrase `` priesthood of the believer,'' was a key concept of the 16th century Reformation, which rejected the clerical domination in the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The convention said the concept `` in no way contradicts'' the `` authority of the pastor which is seen in the command to the local church in Hebrews 13:17, ` Obey your leaders, and submit to them.''' After the resolution was approved by a two-thirds vote sharply divided between moderates and fundamentalists, about 200 moderates staged a protest march to the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, the cradle of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> liberty. There they ripped up copies of the resolution and denounced it as heresy and a betrayal of Protestant heritage. `` This cuts at the soul of what Baptist congregations are all about,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Lolley </PERSON>, driven from the presidency of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary by fundamenalist-imposed controls on choosing faculty. The resolution states that `` misunderstanding and abuse'' of the egalitarian doctrine has led to a mistaken attitude that a `` Christian may believe what he so chooses and still be considered a loyal Southern Baptist.'' It also has been used in `` undermining of pastoral authority,'' but does not contravene the `` responsibility and authority of the pastor,'' the resolution said. Moderates shouted from the floor during the tumultuous debate that the resolution was akin to a `` papal system'' of clerical control and violated <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' teaching that ministers were to be servants, not masters. `` What it's talking about is denominational dictatorship,'' said the Rev. Buckner Fanning of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. `` It says the only way to lead is by blind obedience.''

<TEXT>
 A prominent journalist has proposed radically altering Soviet politics so the people elect their chief executive by secret ballot and power is transferred from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to the government. <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> calls for the changes in this week's edition of the literary newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION>. He says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s parliament, the Supreme Soviet, should be given broad powers, including the right to allocate the budget and impeach the president. The body now merely ratifies the Communist leadership's decisions. The main thesis of <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> adviser and prominent Soviet political thinker, is that the government should be strengthened to the detriment of the party, which now holds a monopoly on political power. `` <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> had some elements of democracy before, but never had liberal traditions ... the freedom of an individual from interference by the state,'' <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> wrote. `` <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> never had any notion about basic human rights.'' The far-reaching article in the weekly newspaper of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> is one of the most radical critiques of the system yet to appear under the auspices of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of liberalization <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> expands on points included in proposals to be discussed at an extraordinariy <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference that begins June 28. He says the country's leader should be elected `` by direct and secret ballot by all the people'' rather than in a meeting of the Politburo of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> suggests a candidate should first attain the post of party general secretary, now the highest Soviet office, then run for president. He does not say if more than one candidate should be allowed to run for each office. The writer also calls for the creation of the post of vice president. Supporters of the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reforms say their efforts are hampered by conservative officials in the party and government who stand to lose power and privilege. Conservatives blocked <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> and other outspoken reformers from being included among the 5,000 delegates to the party conference. The conference can debate and set party policy, but is not expected to make leadership changes. <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> is vice presdident of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and a regular contributor to <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION>. He first gained prominence as an adviser to <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who was ousted as Soviet leader in 1964 by a group which included <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who lead the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> until his death in 1982.

 Prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed at a new record high Thursday, while the dollar lost ground in trading against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished the day's session at 28,147.32 points, up 53.80 points or 0.19 percent, surpassing its previous record reached Wednesday, when the index gained 31.72 points. After opening the day lower at 126.22 yen, the dollar edeged down further and closed at 125.98 yen, down 0.34 yen. `` The market is carrying on Wednesday's strength, which was fueled by an overnight advance on Wall Street,'' said an official of a major securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s main economic barometer posted a record 28,093.52-point close, surpassing the previous closing high of 28,072.02 of last Thursday.

 Leftist guerrillas shot and killed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural adviser and his Peruvian colleague, then wrote in red ink in the American's notebook, `` This is the way the lackeys of Yankee imperialism die.'' <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Orson </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, were killed Monday on an isolated road in the central <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, said police Col. <PERSON> Cirilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacheco </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pacheco </PERSON> said Wednesday that three Shining Path guerrillas halted the agronomists' pickup truck, checked their papers and then shot each man twice in the back of the head. The attackers dynamited the agronomists' truck and escaped, and 30 suspects have been arrested in sweeps of the region, he said. The two men and <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wife, who is expecting a baby, were living in <LOCATION> Aramachay </LOCATION>, a hamlet without electricity or piped water 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, a major city 125 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, said officials of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agrarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON>, was not in the truck. Last Thursday, pro-Cuban guerrillas lobbed three mortar rounds at the residence of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, causing minor damage and no injuries. In another attack Tuesday, a column of <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> rebels swarmed into Huallay village in the highland state of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, killing 14 peasants who belonged to a civil defense patrol organized by the army, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> were teaching peasant farmers methods to improve production of sheep and small farm animals. The Shining Path, an eight-year-old Maoist insurgency, frequently assassinates development workers in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s impoverished highlands in an effort to sow economic chaos. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> had been working on the project only a few months and was preparing to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in August to pursue a doctoral degree, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> development official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The embassy said the men worked for the institute on a project funded by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>. They were traveling from Aramachay to buy supplies in the town of <LOCATION> Sincos </LOCATION> five miles away when the attack occurred, said institute spokesman <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Recuenco </PERSON>. In the only other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> death linked to the guerrilla war, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> woman was among seven passengers killed and 28 wounded when guerrillas bombed a tourist train heading for the <LOCATION> Inca </LOCATION> ruins of Machu Picchu in June 1986. AID has about 20 Americans in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and employs dozens of other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Peruvian citizens under contract agreements, the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> AID office said. The agency spends more than $ 50 million yearly on agriculture, health and food relief programs, officials said. The Shining Path guerrillas launched their insurgency in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> state. Although the Andes remain their stronghold, the violence has spread through much of the country. The government says more than 10,000 people have been slain in the rebels' drive to impose a Marxist state.

 The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market's key indicator set another record high closing today for the second consecutive trading day, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar weakened in trading against the Japanese yen. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues added 53.80 points, or 0.19 percent, to close the day's session at 28,147.32 It surpassed the previous record reached a day earlier, when the index rose 31.72 points. `` Share prices drifted lower on profit-taking selling in the afternoon, mainly in export-related issues,'' said an official with a major <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> securities firm. The Nikkei index had closed the morning session higher at 28,214.52, up 121.00 points. The market was led by large-capital steels and metal issues, the brokerage official added. Trading was moderate, with volume in the first section reaching an estimated 1.4 billion shares, down from 2.5 billion shares Wednesday. Advancing issues included machineries, chemicals and papers. Constructions, housings, drugs and financials were lower. The dollar ranged between 125.98 yen and 126.25 yen before closing at 125.98 yen, the day's low, down 0.34 yen from Wednesday's finish. The dollar maintained strength in the morning, but weakened during afternoon trading because high Japanese gross national product figures for January to March 1987 were expected to be released later today, said a foreign exchange dealer, speaking anonymously. `` Participants anticipating higher GNP went on buying yen and selling dollars,'' he said.

 Despite declining membership and financial shortfalls, the nation's largest Presbyterian denomination is healthy and ready to become a major force, says the man in charge of the church's $ 98 million mission budget. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of the Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> -RRB-, said finances have been worrisome for some time in the 3-million-member church. The denomination Wednesday concluded its nine-day annual meeting after approving a $ 108.7 million budget that includes a $ 5.1 million deficit. <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON> said the church's 11,600 congregations would be challenged to make up the shortfall. Budget concerns surfaced frequently during the 200th annual meeting. <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON> said much of the problem stems from continuing efforts to merge two Presbyterian groups. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -LRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- joined with the smaller, mainly Southern, <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- five years ago, ending a 121-year-old split stemming from the Civil War. `` This was the first real assembly of the new denomination,'' he said, and decisions in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> provide `` a stage for true vigor. We are going to be able to build together.'' <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON> said the assembly's actions would help set priorities for the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> as it goes about allocating the money among competing interests. The revisions and final adoption Tuesday of `` Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age,'' a major policy statement that has been blamed for some divisiveness in the church, will help heal those splits, <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON> and others said. The Rev. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassell </PERSON>, an associate pastor at the denomination's largest church, <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and an original opponent of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obedience </ORGANIZATION> paper, said he was elated by the final product, which was reworded to make it clear civil disobedience or tax resistance by those opposed to government policies were unusual courses for Christians. `` For the first time in a long while, we have a perspective in the broad middle,'' <PERSON> Hassell </PERSON> said. The paper says nuclear war is immoral and the theory of nuclear deterrence `` as an adequate, permanent means to national security ... is not morally defensible.'' It says civil disobedience is justifiable `` in certain circumstances,'' and the church should at least emotionally support its members who make that decision. In other actions during the assembly, the denomination: _ Voted for a new study of the denomination's pro-choice stance on abortion Anti-abortion groups narrowly persuaded the assembly to review the 3-year-old policy. _ Condemned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` repressive'' handling of Palestinian uprisings in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, calling for the nation to end its occupation of the territories and for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to participate in a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Nations-sponsored international peace conference _ Adopted a wide-ranging statement on religious liberty, saying government increasingly is intruding on church affairs _ Declared that `` every person should have affordable, quality health services,'' and supported the adoption of a national health standard of adequate health care by 1990 _ Re-elected the Rev <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> as stated clerk, the church's top constitutional officer. _ Approved the consolidation of the church pension board's headquarters in

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> says Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s education proposals are `` cotton candy'' for schools that need `` meat and potatoes.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, an Illinois who lost his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ideas `` lack vision about what has to be done to bring a first-rate education to every American child.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday unveiled $ 600 million in new or expanded education programs, including a $ 500 million <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> plan that would furnish $ 100,000 awards to schools that make strides in educating the disadvantaged. But <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement that he wants to be the `` education president'' sounds like `` an election-year conversion.'' `` After eight years of not lifting one finger while the White House'' was seeking deep cuts in education, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said, `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a great credibility problem with the claim that he intends to be ` the education president.'''

 Guerrillas loyal to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> fought Syrian-backed mutineers with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades in two refugee camps, killing seven people and wounding 16, police said today. The overnight battle brought the toll to 26 killed and 117 wounded since fighting for control of <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Barajneh </PERSON> broke out last week. The fighting pitted guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction and adversaries of the Fatah-Uprising, a group that rebelled against <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s leadership in May 1983. The clashes raged all night and faded into sporadic exchanges of sniper fire this morning, police said. A security committee comprising guerrilla officers from seven other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions not been involved in the fighting was trying to arrange for observers to enforce a truce in the two shantytowns. A police spokesman said two Libyan observers would be stationed at each of the two camps along with fighters from the seven neutral factions. The disengagement force also will supervise the implementation of a cease-fire reached in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, on Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> rebels are led by Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>. They have been based in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> since the mutiny began. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s loyalists dislodged <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s fighters from the two camps in previous rounds of fighting. But <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s guerrillas regrouped and this week mounted new assaults seeking to regain their old positions. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has about 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They are stationed in east and north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> suburbs next to the camps. A Palestinian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Libyan observers will be drawn from a 300-strong contingent based in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1982, when it came to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to help fight the Israeli invasion.

 Bands of English, Dutch and West German rowdies brawled after a European Soccer Championship match, but the city was quiet today after thousands of riot police massed in its center. Authorities said massive security efforts had thwarted serious violent clashes. In all, 371 people were arrested during two days that ended Wednesday. Of them, 18 were English fans, police said. Most of those arrested were released after spending several hours in jail. Sporadic fistfights erupted in various parts of the city on Wednesday after the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' 3-1 victory over <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s national team Soccer fans mobbed the streets and <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION>'s main train station But by midnight, the station and surrounding streets were nearly clear of fans. Most had boarded outbound trains. Streets in the city's Old Section were also quiet, police said. More than 2,300 police were deployed in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> to prevent a recurrence of the rampant vandalism and running battles that erupted among rowdies in the city Tuesday night. `` It was n't as bad as we had feared,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodax </PERSON>, adding that most of the violence was initiated by West German fans. `` The English were not the problem,'' <PERSON> Rodax </PERSON> said. West German television late Wednesday showed a pistol confiscated from one of the rowdies, but did not identify its owner. On Wednesday night, West German, Dutch and English soccer fans got into a street brawl near the train station. Riot police rushed to the scene, broke up the fight and arrested about 20 people, observers said. West German and English rowdies also had minor scuffles inside the train station itself as English fans waited for trains to take them out of the city. Many of the English were headed to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are to meet for a match on Saturday. About 22,000 Dutch and about 8,500 English fans jammed into <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> for the game on Wednesday. Their arrival followed a night of vandalism and fighting pitting West German fans against English soccer buffs. Police said in that round of violence 130 people were arrested, 90 of them English and 40 West Germans. English club teams were barred from European Cup tournaments after a rampage by English fans that left 39 people dead at a European Cup final in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> three years ago. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Millichip </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the latest trouble could destroy the last faint hope English clubs have of being readmitted to European competition, and that he feared it might also force the international team into exile. British Sports Minister <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, who was on a fact-finding mission in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> for Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to look into the clashes, also strongly denounced the violence. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, also speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said of the British troublemakers: `` They are worse than animals, because I know of no animals which would behave in this manner.''

 The man with the shabby clothes and the faraway look ambled down West 46th Street. Behind him strode six <PERSON> Guardian </PERSON> <PERSON> Angels </PERSON>, making sure he kept on ambling, through Restaurant Row and out of the neighborhood off <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. `` He's not going to sell -LRB- drugs -RRB- with us around,'' <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> `` Ace'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>' operation, said Wednesday night as he watched the parade. The Angels were recruited last week by a group of 15 restaurateurs who claimed increased drug dealing on the street had cut their business by as much as 20 percent. The resulting publicity, however, also may be hurting business, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Medlin </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, one of the participating restaurants, though he thinks the <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> `` are doing a wonderful job.'' `` We have alerted everyone that West 46th Street is combat alley,'' he said. `` We may have a safer block _ with no one on it.'' Despite debates over whether the patrols are good or bad, whether the <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> are violating people's rights _ and despite attacks on two Angels on Saturday that resulted in the hospitalization of a 16-year-old Angel _ the <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> will continue `` slammin' and jammin','' leader <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said. That means holding suspected drug dealers up against a wall, under citizen's arrest, until police arrive. Those carrying just a little crack may get off with crushed vials and a shove. `` It's not a block watch or a crime watch, it's physical intervention,'' <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said. `` It's action.'' The Angels on Wednesday expanded their patrols into the Broadway theater district and neighboring Hell's Kitchen, a neighborhood plagued by a drug problem, he said. The Angels began their watch June 7 in return for a headquarters in the closed Cafe de <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and meals from restaurants on the block between Eighth and Ninth avenues. <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> recalled that he laughed when first approached about patrolling Restaurant Row, a pleasant block of brownstones lined with more than 20 restaurants near the theater district. Still, he agreed to stop by. `` We're walking down the street,'' <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said, `` and dudes were cracking it up all over the place.'' To get there from the theaters and hotels around Times Square, patrons must cross Eighth Avenue, a noisy, tawdry thoroughfare lined with porno palaces. Bringing in the Angels while complaining about a lack of police protection naturally led to tension between the civilian patrol and the Police Department. Two Angels were arrested Sunday and charged with menacing and harassing a man on the sidewalk. `` Even the police have no right to tell someone to get off the block,'' said Assistant Chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. Police officials told <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> on Sunday night that the Angels must refrain from harassing people they suspect of drug dealing. They could make a citizen's arrest only if they witnessed a crime. Wednesday afternoon, <PERSON> Angels </PERSON> grabbed a man they said had been selling crack, called police and held him until officers arrived and arrested him on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance. It was the first such arrest since Sunday. `` They do good, but they can be a hazard,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dirdis </PERSON>, 45, as he sat on the steps outside his 46th Street apartment building. `` They move as a group, and they react very fast _ they have to take it easy. They make me a little uncomfortable.'' But Wednesday night, many passers-by greeted the Angels with encouragement: `` Keep up the good work'' and `` We're proud of you guys.'' `` These guys are n't hurting people who are minding their own business,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilby </PERSON>, who lives on West 47th Street and stopped by the <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>' headquarters to offer support. `` It does n't feel dangerous anymore. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, asked about the expanding patrols, said, `` There's nothing wrong with that. We can encourage responsible citizen involvement.'' The Angels use `` methods used by the cop on the beat years ago,'' <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said, before complaints by civil libertarians limited their options. `` We say, just because you've put manacles on your own cops, do n't take away our rights as citizens to make arrests,'' he said. `` Because of the cops' inability to intervene, we have picked up the slack.'' <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> added, `` We have n't changed our tactics _ it's just that we're in the eye of the storm now.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors unanimously approved an agreement with the state under which the completed but unused <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant would be torn down.

Under the proposal approved Wednesday, the utility would continue as a privately owned company and be provided with annual rate hikes of about 5 percent over 10 years. The agreement is subject to the approval of various state agencies and the Legislature. It calls for the utility to sell the $ 5.3 billion plant to the state for $ 1. The plant would then be torn down. The plant, 50 miles from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, was completed in 1984. The utility failed to obtain an operating license because the state and local governments refused to participate in emergency planning, arguing it was impossible to evacuate the surrounding area in an accident.

Representatives of the guild and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, were scheduled to meet again this afternoon in a bargaining session that management said could `` conclude negotiations.'' Although the guild agreed to the meeting, Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said `` the producers are trying to stampede us into a settlement.'' Sources have said only one issue _ foreign residual payments _ remains. Top negotiators for the guild and the producers' alliance have been meeting informally since the parties' last formal session ended Saturday. On Wednesday, the producers called `` for a meeting of the bargaining committees to conclude negotiations.'' `` Spelled out, that means we are going to give them a formal proposal, based on the intensive meetings we had last week,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an alliance spokesman. The latest effort to end the strike comes on the eve of the television production season. Also looming is this week's scheduled start of talks between producers and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> unions. The stage craft workers' and drivers' contracts expire July 31. A guild source who spoke on condition of anonymity said `` major issues remain unresolved, and we do n't anticipate -LRB- today's -RRB- discussions to result in an imminent end to the strike.'' Sources have said the guild has accepted a producer's formula based on sales success for syndicated one-hour television shows. The previous formula had a fixed revenue. Producers have claimed the market for such sales has softened. But because the guild has accepted a management proposal in one-hour shows, sources said, union negotiators want a substantial increase for foreign residuals, an area that has been booming for several years for studios and distributors but has not been negotiated for 18 years. The guild has cited reports from <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> magazine that estimated a $ 4.9 billion trade surplus for the nationwide entertainment industry in 1986, with an estimated surplus of $ 5.5 billion for 1987, second only to the aerospace industry.

 Radicals demanding punishment for former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> fought riot police with firebombs and rocks today. Police said they arrested six students trying to firebomb <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s home. Police said about 20 students hurling firebombs dashed toward <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s home in western <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Wednesday night. Police guards using tear gas guns stopped the students about 150 yards away from <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s home and arrested six. The students hurled six firebombs at police and a nearby police post, shouting `` Investigate corruption under the former government'' and other anti-government slogans, police said. No damage or injuries were reported. Police seized 48 firebombs and leaflets accusing <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> of abuses of power and corruption during his seven-year tenure. The students demanded a full probe and punishment of the former president and his wife. Fierce fighting broke out today at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> when about 1,000 radicals from five nearby schools tried to march off campus. Police stopped them with volleys of tear gas. `` Punish criminals'' and `` Yankee go home,'' the students shouted as they hurled firebombs and rocks. At least three students suffered minor injuries. The radical students demanded the punishment of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It accused them of masterminding the South Korean army's bloody suppression of a 1980 civil uprising in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. Nearly 200 people were killed in the nine-day uprising for democracy. Students also shouted slogans supporting <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s demand to co-host the Summer Olympics, opening Sept. 17 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, and demanded the withdrawal of some 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed here under a mutual defense pact. They contend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enforces partition of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula to rule the South as a colony. Minor clashes were reported in the southern city of <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION> today when students fought police at a campus. The students were denouncing the blocking of a student march to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> border. Major street clashes broke out last Friday when riot police blocked thousands of radical students from marching to the North Korean border for talks with North Korean students on reunifying the peninsula, divided since the end of World War II. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his family have been accused of corruption since he stepped down in February. His younger brother, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyong-hwan </PERSON>, is awaiting trial on charges of embezzlement, influence peddling and extortion. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s opposition political parties have urged the government to punish <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s family for alleged corruption, contending <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s family members had sent huge amounts of embezzled funds abroad. The main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> says more than 100 of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s relatives embezzled national property when they occupied key posts in government agencies and state-run firms. It also accuses <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> of being responsible for numerous cases of torture and brutality against dissidents when he took power with military backing in 1980. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has opposed a direct investigation of the former president, who has been one of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s close friends since their graduation from the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in 1955. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> agreed to direct presidential elections and other democratic reforms after massive protests last summer. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was elected when the opposition could not agree on a single candidate.

 A Chinese official today criticized the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for allowing <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, to hold a news conference at the parliament building in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The parliament had invited the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> to make a formal address, but withdrew the invitation after <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> showed displeasure by canceling its invitation to the parliament to send a delegation to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON> refused to comment on the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s offer at his news conference Wednesday to accept Chinese troops in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and Chinese control over the region's external affairs in exchange for greater autonomy in internal matters <PERSON> Li </PERSON> told a weekly news briefing that he could not answer questions about <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is not a foreign country. An official who answered the telephone at the <ORGANIZATION> Nationality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which has responsibility for <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and other minority areas, said he could not immediately comment. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said, `` We are opposed to the provision of a forum to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> for his activities aimed at undermining the unification of the motherland by any foreign organizations or individuals.'' The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said Wednesday that complete independence for <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> `` is very difficult to achieve.'' He suggested a `` middle way,'' in which <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would make <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> a self-governing, democratic political entity while continuing to run <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s foreign affairs. He also agreed to a `` restricted number of -LRB- Chinese -RRB- military installations'' in the remote Himalayan region. The proposal was the most conciliatory yet by the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> since he fled <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1959 during a failed uprising by his followers against Chinese rule. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> is the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists. Before the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> entered the remote Himalayan region in 1950, he also was head of its theocratic civil government. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claims to have had sovereignty over <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> since the 13th century, but periods of actual control have been sporadic. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> has lived since 1959 in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and has repeatedly accused the Chinese government of systematically violating human rights in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and oppressing the people by stationing hundreds of thousands of soldiers there. Pro-independence sentiment remains strong among many Tibetans, especially young <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks. Monks led anti-Chinese protests in October and March in which thousands of Tibetatns stoned police and attacked official buildings and cars. At least 38 people were killed in the two protests, and hundreds were arrested.

<HEAD>Mercenary Witness Should Be Jailed, Magistrate Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal magistrate says a former mercenary should be jailed for refusing to cooperate in a $ 24 million lawsuit against an alleged guns-for-drugs smuggling conspiracy to aid the Contras. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> refused to answer questions or turn over documents Wednesday in the civil case filed against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> leaders and <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> drug traffickers by two journalists and the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has to do with principle,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnoff </PERSON>. `` My past would have been in vain.'' But the magistrate said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s position had no legal basis and ordered him held in civil contempt until he answered the questions during depositions. <PERSON> Turnoff </PERSON> said he would make his recommendation to the presiding judge in the case, Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who is on vacation until next week. The suit was filed by <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Honey </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> was injured in a 1984 bombing in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that he blames on the alleged conspirators. The damage and racketeering suit charges that members of a right-wing terror network tracing back to 1959 illegally participated in assassination plots, gun running and drug trafficking. Hall, who will remain free at least until King returns to the bench, said he has been told he can be jailed indefinitely for refusing to hand over the documents, and for up to six months for not answering questions. `` I'm prepared to go to jail as long as the case takes,'' he said. Hall is not considered a major witness in the case, but the plaintiffs want to know who paid and directed <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> while he aided the Contras inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In 1986, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was caught by the Sandinista government, which called him mentally unstable and later kicked him out of the country. Hall has acknowledged receiving funds from anticommunist militant and former Maj. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>, his boss in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and one of 29 defendants in the suit. The case is set for trial June 27. However, he repeatedly refused to disclose where other funds came from or who trained and directed him in the use of explosives. Asked whom he was protecting, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> replied `` <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> and above,'' indicating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials. But he added his information, while politically embarrassing, did not involve illegal acts. Hall, who lives in <LOCATION> Redington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>, also said he has connections with Iran-Contra figure <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, an assistant to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and a defendant in the suit. He said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> promised him a presidential pardon for his activities in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, also attended the hearing, and bitterly attacked the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the suit. `` This is a completely baseless lawsuit ... that has consumed hundreds of thousands of dollars, indeed millions of dollars of the defendants' money,'' he told Turnoff. Along with <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> and <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, defendants in the suit include <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>, former deputy director of operations for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> leaders <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>; Iran-Contra figures <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, and others. The suit was filed in May 1986, six months before the Iran-Contra affair became public.

<HEAD>Soviet Jews Express Concern Over Lack Of Immigration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 700 Jews who emigrated from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> gathered for an emotional reunion that was tinged by a concern that many of their compatriots are choosing not to come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The reunion in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> marked the 18th anniversary of an unsuccessful attempt by a Lenigrad Zionist group to hijack a Soviet plane to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The attempt was foiled by authorities before the passengers even boarded the plane. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Soviet film director <PERSON> Eldar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryazanov </PERSON>, visiting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a trip that would have been unfathomable several years ago, told about 1,000 Soviet Jewish immigrants that `` freedom to travel, to move, is as natural as the freedom to breathe.'' <PERSON> Ryazanov </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> screening his latest film for Soviet Jewish immigrants, praised <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as `` the most humane leader'' his country has had in decades. He also said ties between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, severed by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> in 1967, should be renewed. His remarks won applause from the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Theater audience. At the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> meeting Wednesday night, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said that fervor to emigrate among Soviet Jews in the 1970s left him feeling something close to nostalgia. `` No one asked where these people wanted to fly to ... everyone knew they wanted to come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. More than 90 percent of the Jews who left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last month did not come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hillel </PERSON> <PERSON> Butman </PERSON>, 55, who was jailed for nine years for his role in the hijacking, put much of the blame for the high dropout rate on the immigrants themselves. `` There is still a lot of Soviet propoganda and lies about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but the worst is letters from relatives here who write only about the bad, not the good,'' <PERSON> Butman </PERSON> said. The immigrants' prime complaint about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can be explained in one word: jobs. Many of the Russian Jews are highly-educated professionals with specialized training, who have difficulty finding appropriate openings here. `` It's just impossible to find work,'' said <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberman </PERSON>, an engineer with a doctorate who immigrated seven months ago after waiting 12 years for an exit visa. `` I could find a job in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ certainly in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But we wanted to be here.'' His wife, <PERSON> Chana </PERSON>, a piano teacher who was fired for her Zionist activities in 1981, added, `` When we were refuseniks, I used to tell everyone they must come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, that this is our state and they must be here. But now I do n't know what I would say.'' Recent political developments, especially the six-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, have discouraged Soviet Jews from coming to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ze'ev </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who settled in the northern port town of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> in 1979. `` Soviet propoganda is very effective, and it is very easy these days to take an article from an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> newspaper, condense it and make it say that even the Israelis admit they kill all Arabs and have apartheid,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said.

 An Army probe that allegedly forced a <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> rival out of business included accusations echoing those contained in memos sent to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> by a friend and <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> consultant, it was reported today. Allegations in memos sent to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> bear a striking similarity to language contained in a highly critical <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> report on the company later issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. However, no link between <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and the investigation of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Garcia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ordnance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been documented, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was indicted on charges that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in an improper attempt to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on behalf of the defunct <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> defense contractor. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> is scheduled to be tried with two associates later this year. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordnance </PERSON> is not mentioned in <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s indictment. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> received a no-bid, $ 32-million Army engine contract in 1982 with strong backing from then-Meese aide <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, according to testimony in federal court earlier this year and at <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings last fall. Although many of the allegations made against <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> were never proven, the newspaper reported, its executives were barred from doing business with the government. Because the government was the company's only customer, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordnance </PERSON> was forced out of business when it was barred from government work, company officers said. Attorneys for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, a presidential counselor during the time he received the memos, and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> denied any involvement in triggering the <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> probe. The office of independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who is investigating <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, is aware of the <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> case but refused to comment on it, according to the Times. Army officials refused to disclose what sparked the probe by its Criminal Investigation Division that came despite earlier favorable reports about the company from military procurement officers. A dozen <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> officers were indicted for alleged fraud after the probe, but 11 were acquitted last year by a presiding judge who said the case never should have been brought to criminal court. Garcia Ordnance President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> was convicted of submitting five false documents to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> but was cleared of charges he conspired to defraud the government by substituting iron for steel in an engine crankshaft Acquitted <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> executive <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> procurement officers turned hostile in one month between 1983 and 1984. `` The model contractor in December was a bum in January,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` Why? Because we were jumping up as a competitor to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> became a serious <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> competitor in December 1983, when it was certified as a minority-operated firm eligible for special government contracts. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> also had the certification. <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> blamed <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for inspiring the case against <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, saying <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials told him <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was aligned with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and wanted an end to <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s competition. The 1981-82 memos from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that were obtained by the newspaper reportedly denounced <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> as an inexperienced company with insufficient resources to handle large government contracts. And in the Army Criminal Investigation Division report dated June 1, 1983, the same arguments were made, the newspaper said. However, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was highly praised by Army engine specialists at Ft.. <PERSON> Belvoir </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in a 1982 report that said the firm was competent and professional despite being in business only two years

 The state attorney general has begun an investigation of a possible hoax by advisers surrounding <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, citing a former family aide who called the teen-ager's story of racial assault `` a pack of lies. Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> announced Wednesday that he had subpoenaed <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON>, a former aide to the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> who says <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s other advisers are interested only in advancing their political goals. `` The <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> story may be that there is no <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> story,'' <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> told reporters. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who is black, has said she was kidnapped and raped by six white men in November. She was found behind her apartment complex in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, an upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> town, partly in a plastic bag, her hair shorn, racial epithets scrawled on her body and animal excrement smeared on her. She and her mother have refused to cooperate in an investigation into her claims, saying they believe the probe wo n't be fair. At a news conference, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON>'s charges, if true, amounted to `` a damning indictment'' of the motivation and the credibility of <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and the two <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> family lawyers, <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. The three advisers, in an appearance Wednesday on the nationally broadcast television talk show `` Donahue,'' denounced <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> and denied that he had played any role in the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case. As the largely black audience booed and hissed loudly at the mention of <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON>'s name, <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> labeled him `` a baldfaced liar and a desperate man.'' <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON>, a 39-year-old private investigator who served as an aide to <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> from January until May, told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> that he left the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> team because the teen-ager's story `` is all nothing but a pack of lies.'' `` This whole situation is not about <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>.

He told the News that <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said, `` ` If we can win this Tawana thing, we'll be the biggest niggers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.''' The real story, he told <ORGANIZATION> WCBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` is the political agenda of <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> was described by the state attorney general as `` a high-level intimate of the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> advisers'' who was seen in `` close conversation'' with <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> family members and <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> at demonstrations in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>. The charges `` deserve immediate and careful attention,'' said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who was appointed special prosecutor in the case by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> was subpoenaed Wednesday to testify before the <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury looking into the case. `` If Mr. <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> is right, then attorneys <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and Rev. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> have been consciously perpetrating a hoax, not only on the black community but on all the people of the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. The News and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> would testify today. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, however, dismissed <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> as `` a guy that drove me around. If he says the story is a pack of lies, why do n't you ask him what the story is? He does n't know.'' `` I have not confided in him in the least,'' said <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, alluding to <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON>'s claim that the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> advisers admitted privately that they had no evidence of what happened to their client. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, also appeared on `` Donahue'' and continued to give her unequivocal support to her advisers.

 The popularity of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> is falling drastically, and an increasing number of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> have negative feelings toward <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an international survey said today. The poll was conducted by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Dong-A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION> daily, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper and <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It said only 38 percent of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> polled said they like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, compared with 70 percent four years ago. It said 51 percent of the 1,996 respondents in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said they dislike <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, up from 39 percent four years ago. The number of South Koreans feeling friendly toward <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> fell from 23 percent in a previous 1984 poll to 14 percent, the survey said. The poll, carried out last month, was the second of its kind and also queried Americans and Japanese on their perception of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. American opinion on ties with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was split, with 43 percent of the 1,258 respondents saying they believe relations are going well, while 40 percent answered in the negative. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> has come under fire from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to increase access to its market to reduce a $ 10 billion trade imbalance it registered last year. When asked what they most closely associated with their Asian neighbor, a majority of the 2,292 Japanese respondents cited the upcoming Olympic Games. But 30 percent of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> said they associate <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with its colonization of the Korean peninusula from 1910 to 1945. About 48 percent of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> also said relations with <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> were negative, up 11 percentage points, and only 24 percent said relations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were positive.

 Two Teamsters will go on trial Aug. 8 in connection with the deaths of 97 people in the December 1986 Dupont Plaza Hotel fire, a judge ruled. District Court Judge <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Brull </PERSON> <PERSON> Cestero </PERSON> on Wednesday also found probable cause to try former union local vice president <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> for perjury in a ruling made after a two-week preliminary hearing. The three members of Teamsters Local 901 were arrested in February in connection with the fire.

According to the ruling, former union delegate <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Muniz </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> and former hotel maintenance worker <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> will be tried for murder, arson and causing damage. <PERSON> Muniz </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> will also be tried for perjury. The star prosecution witness was <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Escudero </PERSON> <PERSON> Aponte </PERSON>, a former hotel maintenance worker who confessed to setting the fire with a can of cooking fuel the afternoon of New Year's Eve. <PERSON> Escudero </PERSON> testified that union officials encouraged him to to start fires as a means of pressuring hotel management to agree to union contract demands. Prosecutors presented about a dozen witnesses at the hearing. The fire broke out when the beachfront hotel was packed with about 1,000 tourists and visitors.

 Two vials of blood found on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> shore earlier this month contained the AIDS antibody, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said, but it stressed that the samples posed virtually no risk to swimmers. `` There has n't been any evidence of AIDS contamination with such samples,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, acting health commissioner, said Wednesday. The samples, which have been turned over to the attorney general's office for further investigation, were discovered June 3 or 4, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said at a news conference. One vial was found on <LOCATION> Ortley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and the other on the north side of <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, both in <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said officials did n't know how long they had been there. Beach patrols discovered five glass tubes, each about 5 inches long and less than an inch in diameter, containing coagulated blood, said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>. Only two were found to have evidence of the AIDS antibody, he said. Presence of the AIDS antibody means the blood came from individuals who carry the AIDS virus and will probably develop the fatal disease, said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's ability to defend itself against disease. `` We do not have a threat of AIDS or AIDS contamination from these samples,'' said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>. The vials were found at about the same time as some syringes.

 Goodboy, an elderly Afghan hound, collapsed and died in 90-plus degree heat as his 91-year-old owner was forced out of her public housing home because of rules against pets. After a quarter-century in an apartment at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>, her pet and her belongings were being moved to a new <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> project in the <LOCATION> Mattapan </LOCATION> section in the humid heat Wednesday. `` Goodboy never made it inside the house,'' she said. `` I was sitting inside and I asked where Goodboy was. I went outside, and he was laid out and he was breathing awfully hard.'' The long-haired dog was moved to shade and given water, but he failed to respond. <PERSON> Goodboy </PERSON> was taken to an animal clinic but could not be revived. The dog probably died of a combination of age, heat and the stress of moving, said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruelty </ORGANIZATION> to Animals. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> said the dog had been restless the night before the move. `` He was up and down and I did n't sleep, either,'' she added. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>, who had said she would never give up <PERSON> Goodboy </PERSON>, lost a six-month fight after the housing authority and <ORGANIZATION> CMJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said she had to give away her pet or leave the project.

<HEAD>Indian Troops Press Offensive Against Tamil Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Indian peacekeeping troops cordoned off a Tamil town in eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> today and began rounding up suspected rebels, area residents and diplomatic sources said. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a newspaper reported that the main Tamil rebel group in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> has agreed in principle to surrender most of its arms in exchange for the rehabilitation of its fighters. Residents of <LOCATION> Batticola </LOCATION>, 135 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said by telephone that Indian troops had surrounded the adjacent town of <LOCATION> Kallady </LOCATION> at about dawn today and had rounded up hundreds of Tamils for questioning. A spokeswoman for the Indian High Commission, or embassy, in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said only that `` Indian troops are continuing their search for Tamil Tiger arms and fighters.'' She spoke on condition of anonymity. The state-run Daily News today quoted Indian sources as saying Indian troops captured 21 Tamil rebels Wednesday, including four guerrilla leaders. It said the rebels were arrested during `` white flag protests'' in the northern and eastern provinces, where Tamils predominate. Hundreds of Tamil homes were decked with white flags Wednesday to underscore a demand that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> begin negotiations with the rebels. In July, President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> signed an Indian-sponsored peace accord aimed at ending the Tamils' guerrilla war. But the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of the rebel groups, rejected the pact and continued fighting for a separate homeland. The English-language Indian Express today quoted unidentified Tamil leaders in the southern Indian city of <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION> as saying an agreement was in the works between the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> and the Indian government. The Express said the two sides still were negotiating the period of time over which the rebels would surrender their arms and their role in restoring peace after five years of guerrilla warfare. The story did not specify exactly what is meant by rehabilitation but the word is generally used to mean helping the combatants shift from soldiering to more socially useful occupations. The paper said the agreement could be announced as early as Friday, when Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION>. An Indian official in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the report was speculative, but that <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> officials had been talking with the Tamil rebels. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the Sri Lankan war because it is the dominant power in the region and because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the separatist rebels' cause. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has sent at least 50,000 troops to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to police the cease-fire called for in the July agreement, and this force has inflicted a series of defeats on the rebels in recent weeks. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. They claim discrimination by the Sinhalese Buddhists, who form 75 percent of the population and control the government and military.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> vowed today to wage `` unceasing war'' against <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> after a guerrilla bomb blew up at a festive foot race packed with people, killing six soldiers and wounding 10 civilians. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Belfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for Wednesday night's bombing _ the guerrilla group's deadliest attack in seven months _ in a statement today to news media in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas slipped into the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> town of <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>, headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and wired a bomb containing seven pounds of explosives to an unmarked army van, the statement said. The blue van exploded as six soldiers rode away in it after taking part in half-marathon of 13 miles that had attracted 4,250 competitors to <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>, seven miles southwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. All six soldiers were killed, bringing this year's death toll from the province's sectarian violence to 38, eight this week alone. Mayor <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleakes </PERSON> said the town was in `` shock and disbelief that any human being could do this to other human beings.'' None of the civilians, including an 80-year-old man and a 2-year-old boy, suffered serious injuries, police said. <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, 28, who lives nearby, said the town `` was packed with people ... They were running about screaming. There were children and families. They were terrified.'' The death toll was the highest since an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing at a war memorial ceremony in <LOCATION> Enniskillen </LOCATION> on Nov. 8. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said that bomb was meant to kill soldiers but accidentally massacred 11 Protestant civilians. The explosion occurred as the van moved through the town center, which was thronged with runners and spectators leaving the charity run. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON>, 19, who was two cars behind the van, said he saw smoke, then heard a loud explosion `` and I saw two bodies lying in the middle of the road. One of them had no legs, and one of them was burning. It as badly mutilated. It seems they were blown from the van. There was panic and people were running everywhere.'' Although police said they received no warning before the blast, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said: `` Every care was exercised by our volunteers to ensure the minimum risk to the local population. The statement said the British presence in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> oppressed the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> people, adding: `` Until that presence is removed and the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> people as a unit can exercise our right to national self-determination, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> will continue to wage unceasing war against the British Crown Forces and the British colonial presence.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s representative in the province, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, toured the bomb scene today and told reporters later the attack revealed the `` vileness of terrorism which we have to face.'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said, however, that the security forces had not taken adequate security precautions to prevent the bombing. British soldiers and police are the main targets of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> in its nearly 20-year war to oust the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republic. Police on today cordoned the area where the bomb went off. Townspeople gathered in clusters by ribbon barrier, gazing in silence at the van's gutted hulk. <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s Irish News, the province's main <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> had opened `` another blood-stained chapter in their perverted history ... The result of their savagery will only be to harden hearts and block progress towards an eventual solution.'' It was the army's worst blow since a 1982 bombing in a pub near <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> killed 11 soldiers and six civilians. An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> offshoot, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility for that attack.

 A hint that a missing couple from <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> are still alive has come from an unlikely source _ a vacation book on <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> checked out of a suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> library and found in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The book was returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> from a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, post office where it was found. It had been checked out with <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s library card, police said Wednesday. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>, 21, have not been seen since April 2. Their luxury car was found in a downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> alley with most of their belongings undisturbed and the keys still in the ignition. Police initially suspected the couple had met with foul play. But some of the circumstances surrounding their disappearance _ they were married secretly about a week earlier _ led to speculation they may have eloped. Commander <PERSON> Ettore </PERSON> <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON>, who is heading the investigation, said the book, `` Hidden <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>: The Adventurer's Guide'' was checked out of the <LOCATION> Wheaton </LOCATION> library on March 29 and was found Saturday in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON> decline to chacterize the find as a `` breakthrough'' in the investigation, when he was asked whether police believed the couple may have been in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> and headed for <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, he replied: ` It's a possibility. We're checking out both possibilities. `` We're sending flyers to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, to the missing persons division of their police department and we're making contact with the appropriate authorities in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON> said. Acquaintances have told police the two were saving money for a trip before their disappearance, that Ms. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> had recently purchased $ 600 worth of clothes and some excerpts found in her diary were about trips to exotic locales. The couple was to have arrived at the <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> family home in Elgin the night of April 2 after visiting Ms. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>'s grandmother in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Officials Spot First Red Wolf Pups Born in the Wild</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANTEO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two pairs of red wolves that were released into the wilderness have produced pups _ a milestone in wildlife officials' efforts to reintroduce the species into its natural habitat, authorities say. The sightings of two wolf pups mark the first time that a species previously extinct in the wild has successfully produced offspring after being returned to its natural environment, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a biologist at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge near <LOCATION> Manteo </LOCATION>. The animals have been declared extinct in the wild since 1980. `` One pup has been seen six or seven times with its mother,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` Then we spotted another of the females with a pup this past Saturday. This is great. It shows just how well the animals have adapted.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said the first pup appeared to be about six weeks old; the second about five weeks. Both appeared to be healthy. Alhough litters usually average five or six pups, there have been no sightings to indicate that more than one survived from either of the two litters, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, the coordinator for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s red wolf project, was more hopeful. `` We ca n't confirm it but we think there might be more pups that survived in the second litter,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> told the News and Observer of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> `` There are many hazards out there for a young pup to confront,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` Rattlesnakes, diseases, parasite problems _ all sorts of things. It's a pretty hostile environment.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said the second female had recently moved her litter after her mate was hit by a car and killed May 29. `` Generally the males provide the food for the first few weeks,'' he said. `` With his death she's had to handle it all, so she just found a better location.'' After the pups are 7 months old, they'll get radio transmitters, similar to the ones worn by the adult wolves to keep track of them. A vast population of red wolves once roamed the Southeast but teetered near extinction in the late 1970s. In 1978, the last pure red wolves were taken from the wild to a <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, zoo, where breeding in captivity encouraged biologists to try reintroducing the animals into the wild. Since September 1987, four pairs of wolves have been released in the Alligator Refuge in coastal <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In addition to the death of the male wolf, two females have apparently died of natural causes.

 <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s got a copyright on his confession and his organization is not taking it lightly that the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> is promoting a production by using the minister's public admission of sin The radio commercial began airing today, opera officials said. It promotes the opera company's June 30 and July 2 performances of <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>'s 1956 opera `` Susannah,'' in which an isolated young woman is seduced by a hypocritical, backwoods <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> preacher. In the commercial, the voice of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> is heard to say: `` I do not plan in any way to whitewash my sin. I have no one but myself to blame.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, a Louisiana-based television preacher, made the statement during a February speech to his congregation. He never specified the sin, but he was reported to have met several times with a prostitute at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> motel to watch her perform sexual acts. He has not denied those reports. `` We're looking into this to see if there's a violation of our copyrights,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> attorney who is a board member of the <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are not going to comment further, just examine it from a legal standpoint. They do n't have the right to use material that we've copyrighted.'' He said the ministries have copyrighted the <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> confession. A 10-second television spot produced for the opera company re-enacts a scene from the opera in which <PERSON> Susannah </PERSON>, with her back to the camera, bathes nude in a creek, while an announcer says, `` <PERSON> Susannah </PERSON> takes it off, and the elders ca n't bear it.'' <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Beggs </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> marketing director, said the hint of sexual scandal was a natural in marketing the opera. `` This is so topical it's unbelievable, with <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Beggs </PERSON> said. `` It was sort of a connection everybody was drawing.'' The company hopes the advertisements will amuse and not offend, she said. `` We certainly did n't do it with any malicious intent. We just want to bring opera into range of focus of people's experiences,'' Ms. <PERSON> Beggs </PERSON> said. The radio advertisement, which was produced by <PERSON> Lawler </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> Advertising, used the clip from <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s Feb. 21 public confession, then followed it with the voice of announcer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> saying: `` Lustful evangelists have gotten a lot of publicity lately. But if you want to see the most lustful evangelist of all, come watch the Rev. <PERSON> Olin </PERSON> <PERSON> Blitch </PERSON> try to convert the beautiful but innocent <PERSON> Susannah </PERSON> to a life of sin and degradation in <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>'s all-American opera ` <PERSON> Susannah </PERSON>' ... probably the only great opera ever written that takes place in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>.''

 One person was killed and several others were injured today during a parliamentary election that will test the power of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s main challenger. Election officials later postponed voting at one polling station after allegations that loyalists of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> tried to rig ballots. The contest for a seat in the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> pitted former Defense Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Gandhi ally-turned-foe, against singer and film writer <PERSON> Sunil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shastri </PERSON>, of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The battle between <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 56, and <PERSON> Shastri </PERSON>, 38, has been watched closely as a measure of how <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> would do in a national contest against <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. The polling booth in the <LOCATION> Satpura </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION> did not open today because of irregularities, election officials said. Balloting was rescheduled for Friday. Officials gave no details. But <PERSON> Chander </PERSON> <PERSON> Amrit </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morcha </ORGANIZATION> political group, said 15 armed men had raided the Satpura polling booth and marked 800 ballots, most of them for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate. One of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s supporters was shot and injured in a clash in the village of <LOCATION> Naini </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION>, election authorities said. He was identified as <PERSON> Narendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Pal </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a member of the state assembly. He is not related to the candidate. In neighboring <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> state, one person was killed and several injured in clashes among factions at three villages, the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. No details were available. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, running as an independent with the backing of most of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s major opposition parties, was among the first to cast his vote in <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION>, 360 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. `` I voted for myself,'' he said. `` Who else is there?'' <PERSON> Shastri </PERSON> was not eligible to vote because he is registered in his home city of <LOCATION> Gorakhpur </LOCATION>, 120 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION>. More than 6.5 million voters in eight states were eligible to vote in off-year elections for seven <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and 11 state assembly seats. Lines formed outside the voting centers long before they opened at 7:30 a.m. Polls were to close at 4:30 p.m., and final results were expected late Friday or Saturday. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> broke with the prime minister last year over the government's hesitation to investigate alleged kickbacks in defense contracts. Opposition parties and the press have alleged that government officials and <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> cronies received kickbacks to facilitate the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> artillery guns from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and West German submarines. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his party have denied the charges. The <ORGANIZATION> Allahabad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> seat became vacant when film star <PERSON> Agitabh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachchan </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, was forced to resign because of allegations his brother may have been a conduit for kickbacks. The <PERSON> Bachchan </PERSON> brothers have denied any wrongdoing. <PERSON> Shastri </PERSON> is the son of popular late Prime Minister <PERSON> Lal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahadur </PERSON> <PERSON> Shastri </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shastri </PERSON> are just two of the 68 candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> seat, but only one other candidate, <ORGANIZATION> Kanshi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ram </ORGANIZATION>, is considered a serious contender. Ram has championed the causes of the lower castes.

 The top priority of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> will be to convince the presidential candidates that cities need help, especially in the fight against drugs, the organization's new president said. Mayor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was installed Wednesday as the 45th president of the organization during the closing session of its annual meeting. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, who succeeds Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the two-year post, said Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may have erred in being the only presidential nominee to snub an invitation to address the gathering. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke to the mayors on Sunday and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appeared on Tuesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said a scheduling conflict prevented him from coming to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but he sent a detailed letter addressing the needs of cities, <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said. `` If I were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, I would want to be here, and not having been here, I would want to talk to as many mayors as possible,'' said <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, a Democrat. Of the problems facing cities, the most serious is the use of illicit drugs and the crime it spawns, <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said during a news conference. `` Number one is drugs. The problem of crack is overwhelming us,'' <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said. `` Almost all of our crime is drug-related,'' in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, he said. `` We simply do n't have the resources to fight this.'' <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said the conference sent a telegram to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday asking for an amendment that would allow federal anti-crime funds to be sent directly to cities for use in the war on drugs. `` We have n't acted as though we are at war, and we must if we are to conquer that which is conquering us,'' he said. After drugs, cities need federal help for mass transit, housing and job training, said <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>. Mayor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, whose city will host next year's annual meeting, said aid to cities has dropped sharply in recent years. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said Urban Development Action Grants have been reduced from a high of about $ 750 million in 1980 to $ 216 million last year. However, the mayors did n't blame the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` I fault the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>. Mayors attending the conference hailed <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> as a creative urban leader and articulate spokesman for the nation's cities. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> was elected mayor of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> in 1959 after serving on the city commission. He was defeated in 1966, but reclaimed the office in 1970 and has held it since then.

 Sunken treasure from two 17th century Spanish galleons fetched $ 2.89 million at a two-day auction, with silver bars selling for about twice their value as precious metal. The Nuestra Senora de Atocha and its sister ship, the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Margarita </LOCATION>, went down off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> in a 1622 hurricane, taking to the bottom booty collected from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s New World colonies. Treasure hunter <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> and his team of divers located and salvaged the wrecks of the two ships. Besides silver coins and bullion bars weighing up to 90 pounds, Wednesday's auction at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s also featured a silver-gilt rosewater dish that failed to sell during the main session Tuesday night. The Spanish Ministry of Culture claimed the dish, which portrays a Spaniard carrying a spear and blowing a hunting horn, for $ 49,500. Wednesday's session drew about 100 numismatic buffs and other curiosity seekers, compared to 450 people Tuesday night. A 78-pound, 10-ounce silver bar from the Atocha, which yielded the richest treasure haul ever found, sold for $ 14,300. An extremely rare Philip IV coin from the mint of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> went within its presale estimate at $ 2,800. The last and smallest silver bar _ a 1 pound, 4 ounce specimen estimated at $ 400 to $ 600 _ shot up to $ 3,300. Other silver bars hovered mostly in the $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 range. `` They're something you'd want for a souvenir _ but who would want a lot of them?'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, head of the silver department at <ORGANIZATION> Christie </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said the bars would `` melt for about half'' of their auction price. The showy, big-ticket items went Tuesday night, when the crowd of onlookers included <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil tycoon <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and actress <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>. Neither made a purchase. The <ORGANIZATION> Portuguese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> purchased two brass, mariner's astrolabes used by the pilots of the ill-fated vessels They went for $ 132,000 and $ 83,000 Tuesday night. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> also said that a `` very rich, American private -LRB- collector -RRB-'' had submitted the $ 319,000 bid Tuesday for a 62-inch-long Renaissance gold chain recovered from the Margarita.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says it would be `` ridiculous'' to assume that the Nicaraguan Sandinistas will negotiate democratic reforms without military pressure from the Contra rebels. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday reopened the possibility he will ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve new aid for the resistance fighters in the wake of the collapse of peace talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. Both <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> hinted strongly that they'll move for more aid, while Contra leaders met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to press their case. The administration has suffered a long series of setbacks in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the Contra aid issue. Officials this week have been holding strategy meetings with the rebel leaders, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> discussed the issue Wednesday with several pro-Contra congressmen. In an interview with journalists from countries participating in the seven-nation economic summit opening Sunday in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked if military pressure was needed to get the collapsed Nicaraguan peace talks back on track. `` I think it is so apparent that that is what is necessary, it would be ridiculous for us _ for anyone _ to oppose it,'' he replied. `` We went along with the peace plan that was agreed to among all the Central American states, and to give it a chance. It is apparent that the Sandinistas are not going to democratize.'' He went a step further in the interview, excerpts of which were released by the White House. If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and Contras to continue seeking a peace plan to go with the cease-fire agreed to last March, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` we've got to restore the threat to the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> _ that they must see that the people of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> do have a force there that can be used to bring about an equitable settlement.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, taking part in a pre-summit briefing at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said the peacemaking process `` needs an extra shove.'' Administration officials had said previously they were wary of advancing a military aid package since similar plans had been dealt severe setbacks in recent months. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, when asked if the climate on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> had changed, replied, `` That is the general perception, that the reality of the situation is beginning to sink in, and we can see it in newspaper editorials, we can see it in the attitudes expressed by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Whether it has sunk in to the point where the results of a vote would be changed, is yet to be seen,'' he said. The House on Feb. 3 defeated a proposal by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for additional military aid. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance is now limited to a $ 48 million humanitarian aid providing non-lethal supplies to the rebels. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reassured the pro-Contra legislators earlier Wednesday that he would not abandon his attempt to aid the insurgents. But he conceded that `` we do n't have options at this point, in terms of any specific package. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration was consulting with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and that veteran diplomat <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> had been sent on a special mission to discuss the situation with leaders of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., said he and others sought the meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> out of a concern that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had given up on the Contra issue after multiple setbacks earlier this year in the House `` It was necessary, I think, for some of us to point out that with the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit and now the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> summit and a lot of other things occupying the White House, that we thought it was important that he keep the attention focused on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as well,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., and 145 cosponsors introduced a resolution calling on the president to provide <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with information on how the administration is spending the humanitarian aid package approved in April <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said he was concerned about cash payments being made directly to the rebels without verification that the money was being used for the non-lethal purposes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required when it approved the assistance. <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baeana </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, told an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> meeting that `` the opportunity is there'' to try to find a peaceful solution between the Sandinistas and Contras. The Brazilian diplomat is an official observer at the peace talks.

 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier was shot and slightly wounded in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> today, and troops rounded up Palestinian suspects and clamped a curfew on the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, the army said. It was the first instance of a soldier being shot since Sgt. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, 28, was killed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> on March 20. An Arab witness said the suspects were made to stand on one foot while being questioned. Also today, dozens of Jewish settlers, some donning prayer shawls, blocked a major <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> highway for two hours to demand harsh army action against <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> firebombers. And, President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> sharply criticized foreign news media, blaming subconscious anti-Semitic motives for the publication of `` half-truths and occasionally even worse than blatant lies'' about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The reserve soldier was traveling in his own car when he was hit by a bullet, an army spokesman said. He added that it was not immmediately known if the soldier was in uniform. The wounded soldier was taken by helicopter to a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> hospital and `` the circumstances of the injury are being investigated,'' the spokesman said, refusing to elaborate. Troops began an immediate search for Arab suspects and the weapon inside <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, according to security sources. They spoke on condition of anonymity. Following the shooting, all drivers except <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> settlers who live nearby were stopped from entering or leaving <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> vehicle as well as one belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> were turned back. Some four hours after the shooting, about 60 cars were lined up outside <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and an equal number were queued inside the city waiting to pass a roadblock manned by three jeeploads of troops. A helicopter hovered overhead. Arab witnesses said troops rounded up dozens of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and fired shots in the air. `` It seems the army is very angry because this is the first time I've seen them this strict. They are shooting in the air like crazy,'' said <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Islam </PERSON> <PERSON> Deedi </PERSON>, an Arab reporter who lives in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, said the army set up about 10 roadblocks in the city center, rounded up about 50 suspects and made them stand on one leg against a wall. <PERSON> Deedi </PERSON>, who said he could see the roundup from a window in his home, said soldiers blocked all entrances to the city and stopped and searched cars. He said several busloads of troops patrolled the streets. Several Palestinians in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said by telephone that they became aware of trouble only when they heard Israeli troops telling them over loudspeakers to stay indoors. `` A curfew is being imposed until further notice,'' the troops said in Arabic. The blared order could be heard over the telephone line. Since anti-occupation unrest began Dec. 8 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 208 Arabs have been killed. Two Israelis also have died. Palestinians have stepped up firebomb attacks, and PLO-linked leaders of the Arab uprising have ordered them to stock up on food, first aid and gasoline to prolong their resistance to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation About 60 settlers from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s settlement of <LOCATION> Efrat </LOCATION> used their cars to block the major Jerusalem-Hebron highway, the route to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for thousands of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. The army responded to the increase in firebomb attacks with orders this week to shoot firebombers. <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, the former army intelligence chief, said world leaders made decisions about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> based on television newscasts which he said contained `` a considerable degree of bias.'' The 30-minute speech during a conference on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the media at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>'s most critical attack, but not his first, on the media. It underscored rising <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> criticism of foreign journalists triggered by wide coverage of the violence.

<TEXT>
 Aides to the chief justice of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said today he would resign, and 279 judges called for a judicial system that would protect basic rights and be independent of the executive branch. The aides said Chief Justice <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong-chul </PERSON> would formally offer his resignation Friday to President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. Opposition parties had called for a new chief justice to reform the `` tarnished'' judiciary. On Wednesday, 85 junior judges called for sweeping judicial reforms and an overhaul of the nation's highest court. It was the first time in modern Korean history that judges staged a collective action to support reforms. `` The judiciary is facing a crisis because it has done little to reform itself despite high popular expectations for democracy,'' the judges said in a statement. Today, 194 more judges across the country issued statements supporting the statement, and the number is expected to swell. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has a total of 940 judges. In a conference today, senior government and governing party officials decided to accept <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s resignation. But they expressed regret over the judges' action, which they said would have a serious political and social effect. The judges said the judiciary has failed to guarantee the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people their basic rights, forcing them to promote such rights `` through their own sacrifice and effort.'' The judges' action came as the government debated the makeup of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to be formed according to a new constitution written after widespread public protests last year. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who took office in 1986, said earlier he had no desire to cling to the post.

He suffers from severely impaired hearing and was unable to identify himself or say where he was from. He communicates mostly by drawing pictures and gesturing and his pictures seem to indicate he survived the crash of a four-seat, single-engine plane that killed his parents, sister and brother. Mexican authorities noticed that <PERSON> Sabat </PERSON> preferred American food and cartoon characters. They contacted <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> authorities for help, and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was called in. <PERSON> Sabat </PERSON>, so named because he was found on a Saturday _ sabado in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> _ has been staying at a children's home in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kincaid </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, said he has received several calls from people saying the boy resembles a missing relative. But he took the French lead more seriously than most. Mrs. <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> saw copies of two drawings and seven photographs of the child published today in the French magazine VSD. `` There is a great resemblance between the photos and <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON>,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from her home in the village of <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bourg </LOCATION> a <LOCATION> Thibouville </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION>. `` I have more and more confidence that he is my grandson.'' In addition, she said, `` the drawings are all signed with a ` P,' both those in the magazine and others described by VSD reporters who saw them.'' One of the drawings reproduced in the magazine shows a stick-figure woman standing beside a small girl, a smaller boy and the plane. Mrs. <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> had a sister and a baby brother born March 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>'s son moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after marrying an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman of <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> descent, who had family in both <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Her daughter-in-law taught biology at a school in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, although Mrs. <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> did not know where. She has not heard from her son since January 1987. <PERSON> Kincaid </PERSON> said he tried to ontact Mrs. <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>'s son in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, but the man apparently had moved without leaving a forwarding address. Mrs. <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> said her daughter-in-law's mother in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had been very ill and possibly had died. She speculated that the family could have been on their way to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at the time of the plane crash. `` If it is <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON>, then evidently he is the only one left,'' she said. `` So while I hope it is really my grandson, I also hope it is not him because that would mean that his parents and the other two children are dead.'' <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> McCray </PERSON>, a social worker with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I'm excited but skeptical. The only problem I have is the age.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> told embassy authorities that her grandson is about 12 years old. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican authorities believe <PERSON> Sabat </PERSON> is about 7 or 8. Ms. <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> said officials planned to ask a doctor to X-ray the boy's arms and legs as a way of getting a more precise estimate of his age.

<HEAD>Operating Rates at Factories Rose to 82.9 Percent in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Operating rates at American factories, mines and utilities rose in May to 82.9 percent, the highest level in more than eight years, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the 0.2 percentage point rise from the April level put operating rates at their highest levels since March 1980, when the rate was 83.7 percent. It was the sixth increase in eight months. Operating rates rose by 0.3 percentage points in April, after dropping 0.1 percent in February and remaining unchanged in March. The May advance was led by gains in the production of autos and parts, primary metals such as steel, and in fabricated metal products. It was the third consecutive steep monthly rise at motor vehicle and parts plants, where operating rates were 83.9 percent, compared with 76.8 percent in February. Analysts had expected the modest rise in overall operating rates after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that production levels had increased 0.4 percent in May. Rising operating rates, if unchecked, are considered by analysts to represent a threat of inflation. The concern is that prices will rise if manufacturers have difficulty meeting demand. The May level of 82.9 percent was 3 percentage points higher than the 79.9 percent rate a year ago, but analysts generally do not consider the overall operating rate to be inflationary until it reaches 85 percent. Rising capacity levels have been attributed to the surge in exports caused by the devaluation of the dollar. But, so far consumer demand in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appears to have been restrained enough to allow manufacturers in most industries to comfortably meet both domestic and foreign demand. In a speech in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said despite strained capacity in steel and certain chemicals, statistics on industrial delivery times do not indicate that inflationary bottlenecks are developing. Delivery times for production materials have moved up only moderately since late 1985 and have stabilized, at least temporarily, during the past five months, he said. The operating rate for manufacturing plants jumped to 83.1 percent in May, up from 82.9 percent a month earlier. Production of durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years, rose by 0.6 percentage points to 81.6 percent, while the rate for non-durable goods declined by 0.4 percentage points to 85.3 percent. The mining industry, which includes oil and gas drilling, operated at 81.3 percent of capacity, down from 81.8 percent in April. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> utilities operated at an 80.9 percent rate in May, up from 80.4 percent.

<HEAD>Interior Delaying New England, Florida Offshore Leases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will delay offering oil and gas leases in federal waters off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to try to meet objections of the states involved, the department announced today. It was the second time in two weeks that the department announced postponements to try to settle controversies over its drilling plans. Last week, a controversial sale off northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was delayed from February to at least October. Today's actions preceded scheduled deliberations by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on putting drilling prohibitions into the department's appropriations bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. A subcommittee approved the bans last week. Spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> had written the committee explaining the delays in an attempt to keep it from enacting drilling bans in an appropriations bill, as it has done several times before. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> offering had been scheduled for February and now will be delayed at least six months, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. This delay will enable the department to put together a negotiating committee with governors of the coastal <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states. `` We think we have made some progress'' in forming such a group to try to reach a compromise, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. In an attempt to protect the shallow <ORGANIZATION> Georges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> fishing grounds, the subcommittee provision would forbid drilling in waters less than 400 meters deep -LRB- 1,312 feet -RRB-. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said this would `` leave only the marginal areas'' available for leasing and `` might leave us without a sale,'' as happened once before when no one bid on areas left out of a previous prohibition. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> postponement involved 14 million acres in the eastern <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> north of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> up to about <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. The area will be dropped from a scheduled offering of tracts in the eastern gulf scheduled for November and will be offered separately. The department announced no schedule for that second offering. The governor's office in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> said under today's agreement it could not occur before next May In the meantime, two 14-member federal-state committees will study oil spills and cleanup in the gulf. The subcommittee measure would forbid drilling in a slightly larger area, about 16 million acres. It was the second deletion of substantial acreage off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in an attempt to satisfy the state. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> ruled the areas around the keys off limits in March. The subcommittee proposal also called for delaying the northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> offering until October, in effect putting <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s delay into law.

 Members of a convoy organized to bring humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> have vowed to take their fight to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials at the border blocked their mission. `` What we are going to do is take them -LRB- the vehicles -RRB- to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and park them across the street from the White House and hope to use them as a national rallying point for the majority of Americans who oppose the war against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, a national coordinator for the convoy. `` We'll probably be there for months,'' he said Wednesday. His sentiments were echoed by <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskat </PERSON>, a convoy member from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We're pretty strong in our desire to take it to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Muskat </PERSON> said this morning from the <LOCATION> Alma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mujer </LOCATION> campground west of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, where most of the group spent the night. He said convoy leaders would meet today to plan the trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Customs agents impounded four vehicles Wednesday after the 38-vehicle Veterans' Peace Convoy attempted to cross into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> without export authorization. The 106 convoy members had planned to take 30 tons of food, medical supplies and clothing to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials served notice that leaving the 38 vehicles there would violate a 3-year-old trade embargo. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Purser </PERSON>, chief customs inspector in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, said he was under orders from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> not to allow the group's trucks, buses and other vehicles out of the country. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, customs spokesman in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said the detained trucks will either be seized or returned to their owners pending the outcome of an investigation. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> supported the custom officials' action, saying that the humanitarian aid could be used against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests in the region. `` Unfortunately, the situation has made it obvious that while much of the cargo they are carrying may constitute humanitarian assistance, the trucks are destined for the Sandinista government, where they could be pressed into service against those who are fighting for their freedom in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republican said. Convoy members and supporters from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> formed a human chain to block traffic on the principal export bridge spanning the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, but a Mexican federal official quickly broke up the blockade. Asked why the group did not try to take their humanitarian aid across the border quietly, <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said: `` This is a very public thing. People around the country have been organizing for months. I do n't think we could have snuck across the border.'' <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, a convoy coordinator from <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, said if the group had not been stopped at the border, `` we never would have gotten the attention that we have gotten in the media, for one thing, and it has helped to bring people to realize that there is an embargo,'' which he said many people oppose. The convoy left from four different regions of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on May 21 and arrived in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> June 7. The vehicles have been camped in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> since then.

<HEAD>South Florida Federal Judges Strike Down U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A decision by federal judges in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to discard federal sentencing guidelines as unconstitutional has been hailed by defense lawyers as bringing humanity back to the courtroom. `` The guidelines were barbaric,'' said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, an area director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION>. `` They turned the judges into automatons.'' Defense attorneys had argued the guidelines did not give judges enough discretion in sentencing. Wednesday's 85-page opinion resulted from a rare `` en banc'' hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>'s 16 federal judges, held April 21. `` It's a very thorough and well-reasoned decision,'' said <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> lawyer who spearheaded the arguments against the guidelines. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON>, whose courtroom is in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, said he did n't think the change would result in widely different sentences. `` We'll just sentence on the old policy, that's all,'' <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON> said. `` We have been sentencing as we have been for decades. All we're doing is continuing that.'' The guidelines were established by the seven-member <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sentencing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, set up by the 1984 Comprehensive Crime Control Act, and applied to any offense comitted after Nov. 1, 1987. Written by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, the 12-4 opinion finds the guidelines unconstitutional primarily because of the composition of the sentencing commission. Because the commission includes three federal judges, the separation of powers outlined in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution is violated, the judges said. Fixing punishments belongs to the legislative branch of government and can not be established by judges, the opinion said. `` This collaborative rule-making effort between the judicial and the executive branches of government cast too long a shadow over the independence and impartiality of the entire federal judiciary,'' <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> wrote. `` We conclude that the act is unconstitutional, and until we receive contrary guidance from a higher authority, the guidelines will not be applied in this district.'' Under the decision, those who are awaiting sentencing for convictions or guilty pleas will be dealt with under the old guidelines. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>, the chief criminal prosecutor in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office, said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will ask that the guidelines remain in force while the decision is appealed. Similar hearings have been held around the country with conflicting opinions on the generally stricter sentencing guidelines included in the 1984 Comprehensive Crime Control Act. On Monday the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed to step into the dispute, and a decision by the high court is expected by early next year, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steer </PERSON>, general counsel to the sentencing commission in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The guidelines allow sentencing judges to take into account the nature of the crime, the grade of the offense, the amount of harm caused, the community's view of the crime and the sentence's deterrent value

 A heat wave baking much of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> persisted into its fourth day today, aggravating a severe drought and causing at least two deaths in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Five tornadoes, meanwhile, spun through <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, hurling vehicles through the air and injuring seven people. Temperatures reached the 80s in many areas of the East and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> by late morning. At <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, the mercury rose from 83 degrees at 11 a.m. to 85 some 40 minutes later. Outside <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, it was 85 degrees at 11 a.m. with 67 percent relative humidity. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was even hotter, recording 88 degrees. `` Have you seen the movie ` Good Morning Vietnam?' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has a line in there that sums it up: ` Hot, damn hot, hot and wet,''' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seashore </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wellfleet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. An estimated 196,000 people jammed beaches Wednesday in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area as the temperature hit 96 degrees, tying a 97-year-old record. It reached 98 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, exceeding by 2 degrees the record set in 1956. The bodies of an elderly woman and her daughter were found today in their <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> apartment. A preliminary investigation indicated the women died because of the heat, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> the miserable weather became an official heat wave, meaning at least three straight days of temperatures at 90 or higher, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warwick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, reported an increase of people coming in with chest pains. `` We've had a lot of chest pains, which I'm sure are precipitated by the heat,'' nursing supervisor <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollengier </PERSON> said today. She said no cases of heat exhaustion had shown up yet. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> officials reported no increase in heat-related illnesses. The unrelenting heat prompted <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> bus drivers to threaten a walkout over broken air conditioners, as highs in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> on Wednesday reached 97 degrees, one degree below the 1945 record. `` It's more than uncomfortable,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, president of the drivers' union. `` It's a safety issue. What if a driver passed out? ... It could be a catastrophe.'' In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, thunderstorms spawned five tornadoes in an area 55 miles long from north to south, tossing vehicles and storage sheds through the air and tearing off several roofs. Seven people were injured, none seriously. One twister hit near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where the air traffic control tower was evacuated for about 25 minutes, <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouleware </PERSON> said. Much of the property damage involved uprooted trees, lost shingles and broken windows, rather than destruction of homes, officials said. To the east, the severe heat is being caused by a high-pressure system off the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> pumping in hot air from the south central part of the country, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyllie </PERSON> said. `` Over hundreds and hundreds of miles, the ground is very, very dry,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> of the Illinois State Water Survey. `` So what the sun is doing is heating the ground and the ground is heating the air.'' The heat, coming in the wake of a dry winter and spring in the nation's midsection, aggravated widespread drought conditions that have threatened farm yields, sending prices rocketing on commodity exchanges. Efforts to cool off put extraordinary pressure on municipal water and utility systems, and some communities began ordering conservation. The heat, however, has not hurt the air conditioning business. `` Sales have been going berserk,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Arundel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Linthicum </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> `` When a heat wave moves in and units break down, people want service and all hell breaks.''

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the nation. June 13 The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> on climate-environment: A distinguished group of international scientists worried about the `` greenhouse effect'' that is changing the Earth's climate has bounced the ball, appropriately enough, into the court of the world's politicians. ... As gases from fossil fuel burning trap energy from the sun near the Earth's surface, the globe gradually heats up. Over the next 50 years, the melting polar ice caps will raise the sea levels from 8 to 60 inches, the scientists predict. In the next century, the experts believe, people will endure devastating floods and severe storms. Deserts will get even hotter. Agriculture will suffer in some areas but be made possible in others where now little can be grown, causing population shifts. ... <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> will disappear, as will some species of life. With proper planning, mankind ought not be among them. The scientists suggest minimizing the damage by rapid development of alternative energy sources and use of nuclear energy, ending deforestation, and planning where to build dikes or take other measures to protect coastal cities.

According to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> assigned a member of his congressional staff in 1984 to work on the book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' which so far has brought the speaker about $ 55,000 in royalties. The employee, who is no longer on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff, was quoted as saying that he spent about 200 hours on the book during office hours. The book had a peculiar smell even before this revelation. It was published by a friend who reportedly was paid more than $ 250,000 by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s campaign committee for re-election services performed during 1985-86. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received a 55 percent royalty on book sales ... four to five times the normal payment to authors. ... The latest disclosure indicates that more than a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee inquiry is needed. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ought to empanel a grand jury to investigate whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has broken the law by using a staff member to work on the book.

 June 12 Hobbs -LRB- N.M. -RRB- Daily News-Sun on drugs: What makes illegal drugs a $ 120 billion industry in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>? The profit motive, of course. Thus, the government in its battle to close down the nefarious industry, is about to embark on a program that may undermine that motive by making it too costly for the consumer to be caught with drugs in his or her possession. A group in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has promised that after the Independence Day recess legislation will be introduced to confiscate the property of both drug users and drug dealers. Presumably this legislation will extend to local law enforcement agencies the power to confiscate any property involved in drug dealings of any kind. It all adds up to waging the equivalent of war to stop forces that are undermining the very foundations of the nation; and if confiscation is the only effective way to win the war, then that is what must be done.

Older students are ignorant of math, despite years of concern. ... The schools have failed to help the unprepared older students. Remedial training courses clearly have not been provided. In a few years the statistics about math ignorance among students ought to look better. One reason for this statistical improvement will be the fact that today's ignorant older students wo n't be there anymore. The older ones of today then will be trying to function outside the classrooms. But they'll still be ignorant, because school systems failed to fix the problem and then lied to the student about his graduation qualities.

 A district judge today rejected a request by <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that he remove himself from the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> gas disaster case because he showed bias against the company. `` Such a procedure is unheard of in trial courts in this country, where the normal course is to approach the high court for transfer of the suit,'' Judge M.W. <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> said. Union Carbide's lawyers on May 6 asked <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> to remove himself from hearing <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s $ 3 billion suit against the U.S.-based multinational company. They said that <PERSON> Deo </PERSON>'s order on Dec. 17 for <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> to pay `` interim relief'' to the gas victims showed bias because he had not ruled on the merits of the case. Nearly 3,000 people were killed and at least 20,000 people were seriously injured when toxic methyl-isocyanate leaked from a pesticide-producing subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> on Dec. 3, 1984. The Indian government is suing for damages in the gas leak, the world's worst industrial accident. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has accused Union Carbide of negligence. Union Carbide contends the accident was caused by sabotage. <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> set June 29 as the next date for a hearing on the damage suit. <PERSON> Deo </PERSON>'s December order was upheld in April by the <ORGANIZATION> Madhya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pradesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which set the amount of payment at $ 192 million. Today, UnionCarbide attorney <PERSON> Fali </PERSON> <PERSON> Nariman </PERSON> argued that the order for relief payments was made `` without any finding of liability and without there being any material at all to indicate how the figure ... was arrived at.'' He added that there was nothing in the order to allow refund of the relief payments should the government lose the suit or final adjudication set a lower liability figure. <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> is the capital of the central Indian state of <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>.

 A man who foiled a bank holdup says he hoped he'd impress the two police officers who took him under their wing when as a teen-age gang member he witnessed a fatal shooting. `` I was hoping those guys would be proud of me,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sperow </PERSON>, 25, who on Wednesday was called a hero by police. Sperow chased a suspected <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> robber down the street, tackled him in an alley and bashed his head with the man's .44 - caliber `` Those two cops straigtened me out and got me on the right track,'' <PERSON> Sperow </PERSON> said after Tuesday's incident `` I was just glad I could do something to try to pay them back.'' Homicide inspector <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fotinos </PERSON>, one of the two officers, said he was heartened to learn what <PERSON> Sperow </PERSON> had done, 11 years after <PERSON> Fotinos </PERSON> and his partner tried to help him out. `` You tend to lose track of these kids, so it's great to learn now that maybe we did a little bit of good,'' he said. Sperow's tackle of one suspect and description of another resulted in the arrest of the two men and the recovery of $ 52,527, police said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>, the arresting officer, was one of several policemen who praised Sperow for his bravery. Sperow, who works at a print shop, was at the bank, waiting in line, `` when when a guy jumped over the counter yelling: ` It's a holdup! It's a holdup!''' he said. `` I said to myself, ` Wow! Here we go.''' He, the other customers and the tellers watched as one suspect, identified by police as <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>, scooped money from cash drawers into a bag. The other suspect, later identified by police as <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, 41, stood by the door brandishing a revolver. <PERSON> Sperow </PERSON> took off after the men when they fled. He tackled <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> and brought him to the ground, he said. `` I figured it was better to go for the guy with the gun. If I went for the guy with the money I might have gotten shot,'' he said. A crowd gathered but nobody offered to help. Sperow managed to get the gun away from the suspect, then hit him in the head with the revolver. Police pulled up shortly afterward. About four hours later, police arrested <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON>. Later, <PERSON> Sperow </PERSON>, who has a wife and 1 -LCB- - year-old daughter, recalled his days as a member of the Hunters Point gang `` I was a punk, someone who was on the wrong track,'' he said. At 14, he witnessed a drugstore robbery in which a guard was shot dead.

 Call it conservation chic: The latest trend in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cusine is the waterless meal. There's more than civic spirit at work, however. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, an ordinance that took effect at the end of April requires restaurants to serve water on request only. But even outside city limits, many restaurateurs are voluntarily turning off the tap. `` You think about it because of the fires,'' said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Averna </PERSON>, manager of Splash, a bistro in the seaside celebrity community of <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, where drought also brings the threat of devastating brush fires. Posh celebrity hangout <ORGANIZATION> Spago </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> is voluntarily dry, as are the <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Chasen </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, an old favorite of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The conservation effort gets a boost this week, as the region's biggest water supplier mails out 200,000 cards to more than 2,000 restaurants to post on tables, outlining the water-on-demand policy The cards bear a picture of a water glass, one-quarter full, and the caption, `` What, no water?'' On the back is an explanation that for each serving of water, it takes three to four times that amount to wash the glass. That's a small but important bit of conservation, with rain and snow runoff in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, source of much of the state's water, at one-half or less of normal levels, said Metropolitan Water District spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Skrove </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> MWD </ORGANIZATION>, wholesale supplier to water districts serving 14 million people throughout <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, paid the $ 13,000 for printing and mailing the restaurant cards, <PERSON> Skrove </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Restaurant Association supplied the mailing list and is urging members to comply, said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyker </PERSON>, executive vice president. The benefits of pulling water glasses off the tables, <PERSON> Kyker </PERSON> tells members, are twofold. Not only do they save water and set an example, they also save money by washing fewer dishes. `` It's your obligation to do your role,'' <PERSON> Kyker </PERSON> tells restaurateurs, `` and besides that, it'll save you money.'' The initial response has been good. Diners do n't usually complain once they find they can get water by asking, said Ms. <PERSON> Averna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> McCague </PERSON>, general manager at the <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION>. But conservation chic is n't for everyone. Stylish Le Dome in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> would n't dream of asking its patrons to sacrifice. Manager <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritz </PERSON> puts it simply but firmly: `` We always serve water, sir.''

 An ex-Wedtech president testified that company officials met with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in an effort to cut out competitors for government contracts, but a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman said the vice president does n't remember meeting them. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON>, the former president of the now-defunct defense contractor, also testified in Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s racketeering trial that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials gave $ 200,000 to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that allegations against a <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> competitor contained in memos to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> by a friend, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, bear a striking similarity to language contained in a highly critical report on the company later issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. However, no link between <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and the investigation of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Garcia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ordnance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been documented, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was indicted on charges that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in an improper attempt to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on behalf of the defunct <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> defense contractor. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> is scheduled to be tried with two associates later this year. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordnance </PERSON> is not mentioned in <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s indictment. In his testimony in federal court, <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON> said that competitors from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> disappeared after the company officials were introduced to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Was the purpose of being introduced to Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to get him to eliminate <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s competition in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>?'' defense attorney <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> asked during cross examination. `` Yes,'' said <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON>. `` Was that done? Was that competition eliminated?'' <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> asked. `` Yes,'' responded <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON>, ending the exchange without specifically connecting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the diminished competition. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, `` The vice president does n't recall meeting -LRB- <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON> -RRB- on any occasion And if he spoke to him, no action was taken up to follow up on their conversation.'' <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON> made his statements during cross-examination late Tuesday by <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, who continued his questioning of the company official on Wednesday. On trial are <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and six co-defendants accused of converting <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> into a racketeering enterprise for the payment of bribes to obtain millions of dollars in no-bid contracts. According to <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, told him that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> offered to help the company acquire a lucrative government bridge pontoon contract in return for a $ 200,000 campaign contribution. `` Was the money paid?'' asked <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, representing defendant <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Betso </PERSON>. `` The monies were collected from various vendors, members of the team, myself. All the officers of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> made contributions to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> totaling $ 200,000,'' <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON> said. `` Was it money well spent?'' continued <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>. `` I do not know,'' replied <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON>, the fourth and last official of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> firm scheduled to testify. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> testified earlier in the trial for the prosecution. <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON>, in his fifth day of cross-examination, then testified that <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> introduced him and several other <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> people to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, in a telephone call from <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday he'd never even met <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON>: `` I would n't now him if he walked past me now.'' As for the witness' charges, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said, `` I absolutely, categorically deny doing anything on their behalf or having any conversation about $ 200,000.'' Defense lawyers are trying to demonstrate <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s government contracts were the result of its many <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> connections and not its ties with the defendants. Toward that end, an assortment of names connected with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, including Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, former adviser <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> and ex-National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, have surfaced during the 14-week trial. The defendants are <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, his son <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, and the others _ <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>, ex-Bronx Borough President <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, attorney <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Neglia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neglia </PERSON> friend <PERSON> Betso </PERSON>. <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON> and three other <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials have pleaded guilty to corruption charges and agreed to testify at the <LOCATION> Biaggi </LOCATION> trial in exchange for leniency. <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON>, 37, testified he could still receive a 10-year prison term despite his testimony.

<TEXT>
 In a city where power is spelled with a capital `` P'' the Doles _ <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> _ are the quintessential <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Couple </ORGANIZATION>, a status confirmed by the likelihood that both are on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list of vice presidential prospects. A Bush-Dole ticket sounds good to a lot of people. The question is, which <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>? The husband is the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leader who finished second to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the race for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. The wife is a former transportation secretary and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> commissioner who won favorable reviews as a campaigner for her husband when he was the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee in 1976 and during his two later bids for the presidential nomination <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> the senator is strongest where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is weakest _ in the Farm Belt, where he thrashed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Polls also show <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> running better among independents and Democrats than does <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> the former transportation secretary also helps <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in an area where he needs it _ among women. Recent polls show a gender gap for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that looks more like a chasm, with the vice president's rating among women running almost 20 points below his standing among men. `` I think it would clearly help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among women,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, when asked the impact of having <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on the ticket. When <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee in 1976, the Secret Service code names for the couple were Ramrod for the candidate and Rainbow for his wife. Those names seem particularly well-chosen in the light of events during and since that campaign. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator has earned a reputation as a tough, acerbic campaigner, whose most memorable moment in the 1988 contest was the night of his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> primary loss when he was asked if he had anything to say to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Tell him to stop lying about my record,'' snarled the senator. A native of <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is a Harvard-educated lawyer who came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the 1960s as a staff assistant in the old <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>. She worked in the White House office of Consumer Affairs under President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and was named to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> by President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. She worked as a special assistant for public liaison in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House and, in February 1983, she was named secretary of transportation. She resigned in September 1987 to do `` everything I can'' to help her husband get elected president. `` I'm from <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, and proud of it,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told campaign audiences. It was an especially effective appeal to Midwestern Republicans, as were the terrible wounds he suffered in World War II which left him without the use of his right arm. He was elected to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1960 and to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1968. In addition to serving in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from 1971 through 1973, and the early days of the Watergate scandal. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was succeeded in the party post by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. When President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> picked the wisecracking <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as his running mate in 1976, the choice surprised many people. His slashing campaign style surprised even more. He later said he was sent `` into the briar patch while he -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- stayed in the Rose Garden.'' The low point came during a vice presidential debate with <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, when <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> referred to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives lost in `` Democrat wars.'' The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator bid for the top spot on the ticket in 1980 and vowed to run a positive campaign. He did, but he got few votes and was an early casualty. His fortunes took a positive turn in 1980 when the Republicans captured control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> landslide. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> soon was getting rave reviews as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and in 1985 he succeeded <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader. He still had his eye on the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and after a big victory in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in February 1988 appeared on his way to the nomination. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned it around in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, helped by television commercials that portrayed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as waffling on arms control and as a supporter of tax increases. Beaten everywhere by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Super Tuesday, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> never recovered and dropped out of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race on March 29. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> often was credited with moving her husband away from the slashing style he displayed in the 1976 campaign, but the `` old'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> often reappeared this year. During the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary campaign, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` sort of had a charmed life in politics. He's gotten quite a ways without ever doing much.'' That kind of talk might make it likely that the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on a Bush-Dole ticket would be named <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>.

<HEAD>President Calls For Independent Probe of Wright</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said today he would welcome the hiring of an outside investigator by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee if that would speed up the panel's probe of his financial dealings. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, reacting to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s call for an independent counsel in the case, said, `` I have frequently said it is all right with me for the committee to do whatever it will.'' `` If the committee feels its work can be expedited by hiring of an outside counsel, then by all means,'' he told reporters. He declined to comment directly on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks, including the president's incorrect assertion that Democrats controlled the ethics committee, saying, `` I'm going to be kinder to the president than he was to me.'' House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., the next ranking Democrat after <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> apparently was `` confused'' and had aligned the White House with `` politically motivated'' Republicans <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said that continued Republican pressure against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is `` a politically motivated attack on the speaker, designed to ... theoretically balance the problems the administration has had with ethics, and even criminal problems.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, speaking on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning,'' said the criticism of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is `` linked to such things as sort of crass fundraising efforts for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, becoming the latest <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officeholder to join the verbal fray over allegations <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules, said Wednesday that `` everyone would feel that it was more proper'' if an investigation were done by someone outside <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee voted last week to investigate allegations the speaker misused his office for personal gain. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, speaking to reporters, said, `` I have to wonder if it should not be an independent counsel from the standpoint of the relationship of the speaker to the majority of the committee. And I think everyone would feel that it was more proper if it was done by an investigator outside _ an appointed investigator.'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, `` there's a confusion over the president's terminology and his comments about the committee. `` The president said he thought it was especially important because of the majority. This is an even committee _ six Democrats, six Republicans,'' said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. `` None of the Democrats -LRB- were -RRB- appointed originally by this speaker. They're people of high integrity; that's why they're put on the committee.'' The committee is looking into allegations that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, has violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules by misusing his office for personal gain and improperly intervening with federal regulators. Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., who first raised the allegations, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and several other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officeholders have suggested that it would be better to have the investigation conducted by an independent counsel <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made the remarks during an interview with seven reporters from the seven countries that will participate in the economic summit June 19-21 in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is accused of six possible violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules but has denied any wrongdoing. The accusations include improper lobbying on behalf of oil companies with which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> may have had financial relationships, circumstances surrounding publication of a book for which he received a higher-than-usual royalty and which was produced with the help of a congressionally paid staffer, contacts with federal officials on behalf of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loans and the use of a condominium in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> for which he paid no monthly rent.

 After more than four decades of dusty travels entertaining fans around the minor leagues, the `` Clown Prince of Baseball,'' <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Patkin </PERSON>, is getting a chance to show his antics on the big screen. <PERSON> Patkin </PERSON>, 68, plays himself in his motion picture debut in `` Bull Durham,'' a baseball comedy opening in theaters this week. `` More people will know who I am, and that feels pretty good,'' said <PERSON> Patkin </PERSON>, who lives in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb of King of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Patkin </PERSON>'s acting career began in the 1940s, when an injury ended the young pitcher's dream of playing in the big leagues. He still made it _ but as a baseball clown, contorting his face and prominent nose while mimicking baseball people with exaggerated gestures. Writer-director <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> caught <PERSON> Patkin </PERSON>'s act in the early 1960s while <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> was a second baseman in the minors. `` He was just a kid,'' <PERSON> Patkin </PERSON> recalled. `` We palled around a little bit back then, and years later, he wrote me into the film.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today picked up the endorsement of former rival <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who predicted that the likely presidential nominee will capture the backing of the South's conservative electorate. `` On occasion, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and I had differences but out friendship always grew and our debates helped strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and increase the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' chance of victory in the fall,'' the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said in a statement he was to deliver later today. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, one of four recent opponents to endorse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor `` is going to carry our party to victory in November. He is going to win in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, in the North, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, and he is going to win right here in the South.'' `` Our part of the country spoke for change on Super Tuesday and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stands for change,'' said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who planned to call on his 289 delegates to back the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor at the Democratic National Convention in July. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was using the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> endorsement to kick off a trip through seven Southern states, many of them once considered secure for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can win <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, the state's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman `` I think <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is the hardest state for any Democrat to win of any Southern state.'' But, said <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` not being perceived as a liberal. He's a progressive, a middle-of-the-roader.'' At the same time, the Democratic chairman said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is perceived `` as a follower, not as a leader.'' In the final round of primaries last week, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> surpassed the 2,081 delegates he needed for a majority, but <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has vowed to remain in the race for the nomination until the votes are counted at the convention. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> dropped out of the race after the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary in which he finished a disappointing third in a field of three. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator had pursued a Southern strategy for the nomination, downplaying the traditional early tests in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and hoping to benefit from a flood of Dixie votes on March 8. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> did well on March 8, but then failed to attract much support in such Northern states as <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as with all Democratic presidential candidates, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> is a critical part of the coalition needed to attain the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. In the last five presidential elections, the only Democratic winner was <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> who carried 10 of 11 Southern states. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took command of the race for the Republican presidential nomination by winning 16 primaries on March 8, most of them in the South. Strategists for the vice president, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englander </LOCATION> who now claims <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as his home, consider the region his base, a claim disputed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> knows he can win states in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and he's going to campaign actively there,'' said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign spokesman `` While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a lot of homes, he has no secure political base and he's going to have to campaign everywhere.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' three-day foray into the region was to include stops in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. He won the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> primaries on March 8. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> carried <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was the winner in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Most Southern Democrats were openly urging <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to choose someone like Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> from the region as his running mate. `` The decision on the vice presidency will be fundamental,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Stetson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> activist. The seven states where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was campaigning have a total of 95 electoral votes, the biggest prizes being <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with 29 and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with 21. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is given little chance of beating <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the most conservative of the Southern states. `` I honestly do n't expect him to take <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a pollster based in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to have to lose it.'' One theme <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was sounding that is welcomed by Southern voters was a tough stand against crime and drugs. During appearances in his home state on Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> touted the declining <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> crime rate and lambasted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for obstructing the war on drugs by cutting <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> funds. `` How can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on drugs when we're cutting <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrols by 55 percent?'' he told reporters outside the state police academy. `` It's that kind of thing _ one of the reasons I'm running for the presidency.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today drugs are `` the ultimate fatal attraction'' and he renewed his call on companies to institute anti-drug programs in order to receive federal contracts. `` The point is that stopping drugs in the workplace is not just a profit and loss issue, it's a matter of protecting the health and safety of workers. It's no less important than <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> regulations on the conditions of machinery,'' the certain Republican presidential nominee told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> annual meeting. `` The federal government should not dictate what kind of drug-free program a company should have, but it should require any federal contractor to have one in place,'' he said. As in the past, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left open the question of whether these programs must include some form of mandatory drug testing. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested that many Americans still do n't know `` who I am'' despite 7 -LCB- years as vice president. He said he would rely heavily on advertising and surrogate speakers to help get his message out. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he may select a woman as a running mate. And he blamed some of his high negatives in recent public opinion polls on Democrats `` shooting at you every day'' during the just-ended primary season. `` I think we have time to be sure that a positive image is out on who I am and what I feel and where I'll take the country. And I'll readily concede that some of that's not clear yet,'' he said. `` I think the answer on the polls, if there are negatives there, is to turn them into positives,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. On the subject of a running mate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that the vote-drawing ability of an individual to help him in the polls `` would be a factor _ man or woman'' in the selection. However, he says his primary consideration remains a capability to take over in the event something happened to the president. `` Look, the gender question was crossed when <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> went on the -LRB- 1984 Democratic -RRB- ticket,'' he said. `` And that was a good thing, a very good thing.'' Among those women mentioned prominently in speculation about the spot are former <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan., <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>. `` Literally, I have n't started thinking about names'' of potential running mates, although `` it's thoroughly understandable there's increased speculation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president declined to say whether he thought recent polls, showing him trailing Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, were partly a reflection of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s lagging popularity. `` I do n't want to lay off any problems I may have on somebody else,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hoped to narrow the gap _ especially the `` gender gap'' indicating he has far less support among women than among men. `` People are interested in the family. I've got a good one,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think we get credit for how we manage family values yet, and what really motivates me. And caring, and compassion and all that stuff.'' He said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` will come out of that Democratic convention with a traditional liberal Democratic platform. We'll come out with a sound, forward-looking Republican platform That will put the differences in focus.'' In a wide-ranging interview on Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also: _ Indicated he would pursue the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's fight for continued military aid for anti-government Contra forces in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if elected, but with more of an effort to reach an accommodation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` I'd want to do it practically to see, let's be sure what we do will pass,'' he said. The adminstration has repeatedly run into broad opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for its efforts to provide military assistance to the Contras. `` I'd love to find a way to take a package to the <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and get it passed,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. _ Said, if elected, he would `` redouble whatever efforts we have'' to press for the release of jailed South African black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and to get the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> governent to negotiate with opposition factions However, he said he opposes the depiction by Democratic platform writers of that white minority-ruled country as a `` terrorist state'' and said he opposes <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' call for tougher economic sanctions. The ones now in place, he said, `` are n't working and are hurting the people we're trying to help.'' _ Conceded that his efforts to paint <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as an elitist `` Harvard liberal'' could backfire, saying: `` I would n't want to do too much of that. However, he said he plans to mix campaign rhetoric against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with facts and said: `` I've got to get people's attention.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to address a national convention of the <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chambers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> today in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, he went to the Capitol to endorse a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> plan to severely punish narcotics users _ including a proposal for the death penalty for major drug dealers, which he had previously supported _ and used the opportunity to accuse Democrats of making a `` shrill political issue'' of anti-drug programs. He also joined former rival <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for a briefing from <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> on this year's drought throughout much of the nation.

 the Democrats' chance of victory in the fall. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is going to carry our party to victory in November. He is going to win in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, in the North, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, and he is going to win right here in the South.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a speech to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jaycees </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, called illegal drugs `` the ultimate fatal attraction'' and reiterated his call for requiring companies with government contracts to have drug-free programs. `` The point is that stopping drugs in the workplace is not just a profit and loss issue; it's a matter of protecting the health and safety of workers,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, testifying before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee, said strengthening the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and Customs border patrol should be the first steps in stopping drugs coming into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There have been calls for greater use of military forces, but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` We must be careful, however, to avoid involving the military in any police actions against citizens or arrests.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> pollster <PERSON> Claibourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said at a news conference that his new survey found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supported by 45.1 percent of prospective Southern voters compared to 42.3 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ a difference falling within the 3.6 percent margin of potential sampling error. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said the survey, conducted among 750 people in nine states June 8-13, also showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could help himself in the South by choosing Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> or former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> as a running mate, but that selecting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` would be disastrous in the South.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he was sticking close to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> due both to a shortage of campaign travel funds and the lull that comes with the end of the primary season. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has spent most of the money allowed under federal limits for the preconvention phase of the campaign. `` You can get more attention for something you say in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ... so you have a different ability to get your message out and still live within your budget,'' the vice president said. The South is critical to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he is to rack up the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was making stops in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor won the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> primaries on March 8. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> carried <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was the winner in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s appearance today before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> education </ORGANIZATION> and abuse, an issue he has highlighted in this year's campaign, was to be followed by a meeting with Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> caucuses, and <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said last week he would vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at the convention on the basis of that. That's a view <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wants other `` super delegates'' to take, too. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said he will seek the support of the unpledged public and party officeholders who will attend the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> as super delegates. With attention increasingly focusing on the convention, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he is ready for a floor fight if he does n't get his way on taxing the wealthy and freezing military spending. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said he met Wednesday with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, who has been interviewing potential running mates to join the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor on the Democratic presidential ticket. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a news conference he has not yet decided whether he would want the post, only that he has earned `` serious consideration.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday went to the Capitol to endorse a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> plan to severely punish narcotics users _ including a proposal for the death penalty for major drug dealers, which he had previously supported. He used the opportunity to accuse Democrats of making a `` shrill political issue'' of anti-drug programs.

 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said he had a `` clear conscience'' as he awaited a jury's verdict on criminal charges that he concealed a $ 350,000 campaign loan. The jury deliberated for 3 hours and 45 minutes after receiving the case Wednesday, then resumed work today. `` I'll feel better when it's here -LRB- the verdict -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 64, told reporters as the jury was dismissed for the night. But he added he expected to sleep well because `` I have a clear conscience.'' The former governor again insisted that he and his co-defendant, his brother <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, were innocent of any crime. But prosecutor <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON> told the jury in Wednesday's final portion of the closing arguments that the Mechams' `` cloak of innocence has been stripped away thread by thread by thread; <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> stand naked before you now ... because the evidence is overwhelming of their guilt. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, took office in January 1987 and was removed April 4 when the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of two unrelated impeachment charges. He also was impeached in connection with the loan, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided not to hear that charge for fear of prejudicing his criminal trial. The Mechams face felony charges of concealing the $ 350,000 loan on financial disclosure reports required by the state. The loan from developer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> did not appear on <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s personal or campaign finance statements. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, told reporters `` there was absolutely no evidence of intent'' to conceal the loan. The defense said the loan was properly reported as part of a $ 465,000 lump sum that was listed as a campaign contribution from <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, and that the failure to itemize the loan was an innocent mistake by his brother, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was his campaign treasurer. <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON> disputed a defense claim that the loan was common knowledge because one former top <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide said she knew about it. `` To claim that the loan was not a secret from the public because some insiders knew about it would be like claiming that the secret plan for the <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> invasion in World War II was public knowledge because the general that planned it knew about it,'' the prosecutor said. <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> lied when he told reporters Oct. 30 that he did not owe any loan to <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>, but that his campaign did, and that he did not intend to repay it. <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> called him shortly afterward, assured <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> he would be repaid, and said his attorney had told him to make the public statement. The defense said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> had no motive to hide the loan because the report on which it appeared was not filed until a month after the Nov. 4, 1986, election. But <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON> said a disclosure of the loan early in <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s new administration would have destroyed his image of being anti-special interest. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was charged with six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents and faced from almost nine to 22 years in prison if convicted of all charges. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> faced three similar counts and up to 9 -LCB- years in prison if convicted of all charges.

 diet high in vitamin-deficient white rice, a researcher suggested Thursday. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Munger </PERSON>, a post-doctoral fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>'s division of epidemiology, said his studies show that stress is not the leading cause of Sudden Unexpected Death Syndrome, as some experts have said. <PERSON> Munger </PERSON>, 34, presented his findings Thursday to a conference of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epidemiologic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, Br humans and monkeys both received the virus from a common ancestor. Monkeys and humans are descendants of primates who lived 20 million to 30 million years ago. The report on African green monkeys by <PERSON> Hayami </PERSON>'s team was published in Nature, a British scientific journal, earlier this month. <PERSON> Carel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> biologist, in a separate commentary in Nature, said the findings mean `` the human viruses can not have originated from African monkeys in recent times, as had been predicted by many people.'' <PERSON> Hayami </PERSON> says many diseases that afflict humans came from animals, so it was not unreasonable to theorize that AIDS did as well. His complete genetic sequencing of the green monkey virus determined that the simian and human viruses were different. The sequencing involved checking by hand 9,000 base pairs of nucleic acids _ the building blocks of genes. His laboratory has not completed sequencing of the mandrill virus yet, but hybridization, another test, shows it is different from human viruses and the African green monkey virus, <PERSON> Hayami </PERSON> said. `` SIV -LRB- Simian Immunodeficiency Virus -RRB- mandrill is really we think an authentic mandrill virus, not from another species,'' <PERSON> Hayami </PERSON> said. The most intriguing aspect of the two simian viruses is that neither produces illness in the animals that host them. Examining why the simian virus does not produce illness could lead `` to a strategy for producing a vaccine'' to prevent AIDS in humans, <PERSON> Hayami </PERSON> said. Because the African green monkey virus has been fully genetically analyzed, it can be compared with the human virus. <PERSON> Hayami </PERSON>'s laboratory has found that the human virus has an `` R'' gene, which is missing in the simian virus. He said his laboratory staff has already begun `` constructing a recombinant clone of the African green monkey cirus with an ` R' gene We are going to test it to try to induce AIDS.'' <PERSON> Hayami </PERSON> said, `` At this moment, nobody knows the function of this gene. If we prove the ` R' gene is responsible for pathogenicity that is very important. We can have the weapon to attack the human virus. But that is only my dream.'' Meanwhile, work is continuing on the full genetic sequencing of the mandrill virus. The virus was found in two mandrills living in the primate center's forested enclosure. Both were born in the wild and captured and brought to the <LOCATION> Franceville </LOCATION> center, a $ 30 million facility built with <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>'s oil earnings to study infertility. In recent years in it has focused on AIDS research. In April, other scientists at the center claimed to have found two chimpanzees with an AIDS virus. If confirmed, it will be the first time chimpanzees have been found with the disease. As chimpanzees are a closer relative of humans than monkeys, this could be another important step for AIDs research.

 Wilting crops and worried farmers are giving this summer a place in the history books, along with most of 1980s, as a dry era in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Drought has plagued one part of the nation or another in every summer this decade except 1982, and the cumulative effect may well pose the most serious danger. For even if the weather breaks and rain reaches farmers, areas like the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> have dry subsoils that wo n't recharge instantly. Indeed, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> has missed what amounts to a year's rainfall in the last four, and the Southeast in general is short a year's rain in this decade, according to government weather records Even so, things are n't yet as bad as the dreary Dust Bowl years of the 1930s. That was a time when five or six dry years threatened to depopulate some areas where the soil blew away with the winds. Now the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> could move into that class, after four dry years that included a 100-year record for drought in 1986, warns <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> of the federal Climate Analysis Center. That region `` is down about 40 inches of rain over four years,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. `` They have had only 75 percent of normal rain in the last four years.'' <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> also have suffered for several years, he added, and this summer other areas are being affected too. This year's drought `` does n't really fit exactly into a pattern like we've seen before. The dust bowl was worse in the Plains, while the driest areas are east of the Plains this year,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. But this sere summer comes late in a dry decade. In 1980, dryness records were set in states from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. In 1984, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> received less than half their normal precipitation. In 1986 and 1987, the Southeast was hit hard. And hot weather has accompanied the parching. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has reported that 1986 and 1987 were the warmest years, on average, in more than three decades and among the warmest on record. That has raised alarm among environmentalists worrying about the greenhouse effect _ the trapping of heat from the sun by carbon dioxide and other gases. Experts fear this ultimately will raise the world's temperature. Much of the Southeast is 12 percent below normal in rainfall in this decade _ the equivalent of a year without rain. Some parts of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> are 70 inches or more below normal. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said this week that a wet July could save the situation but without that, the drought `` could well be a catastrophe.'' Wheat fields in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> already have been damaged, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said, and additional weeks of scorching temperatures and no rain could cause severe damage in the Corn Belt and across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The immediate cause of the drought, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said, is an abnormally strong ridge of high pressure, `` which tends to suppress the mechanisms in the atmosphere which cause precipitation, and tends to steer the storm systems elsewhere.'' In general, weather patterns change more slowly in summer than at other times of year, meteorologists note. So, once a high pressure area is moved into an area by the upper-air weather patterns, it may be difficult to dislodge. The <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> drought has been caused by a strong high pressure area in the northern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> over the last two months, so storms go west or north of the high, or move south to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. That same pattern has directed the storms away from the Southeast and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, he said. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the southern plains were dry this spring, but the forecast calls for relief for both during the next 30 days, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. In the western part of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> area, at least, and in the southern plains and <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>, it looks wet for the summer as a whole, he said. In the Southeast, he said, `` We are not predicting particularly dry weather for the next 30 days, but we did have an indication the area could have a dry summer. So the next couple weeks may have a few showers, but it could dry out later.'' That same pattern, he said, is `` causing us to predict a relative chance of above normal rainfall for the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> for the summer.'' `` A ridge of high pressure is predicted to move somewhat farther south as summer goes on, and the Southeast will dry out and the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> or Great Lakes could end up with normal or above normal rain by summer's end. `` But that may not be in time to help the crops,'' he said. In the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, there was severe drought last fall and it's been wet in the last month, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> noted But, he added, `` that's deceptive because they get most the rain in fall and winter, so they are down several inches too ... The subsoil is dry although the top may be moist.'' In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, for the most part, the indication is for a near normal summer, although it looks dry during the next 30 days in the areas around <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 This has been a dry decade _ except for 1982 _ in much of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Here's the rundown: 1980: Hot and dry summer weather developed in a pattern similar to the unpleasant summers of 1952-54. Rainfall was between 25 percent and 50 percent of normal across much of the nation. The heat wave was blamed for as many as 1,200 deaths and crop and livestock damage estimated at $ 20 billion. Record dryness in various months were reported in parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> as the hot, dry weather extended from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> throughout the Southeastern states. 1981: Much of the nation remained in the grip of the drought which began in 1980. Light winter snowfall meant that groundwater was not recharged and municipal water supplies in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> slipped to dangerously low levels. Rains starting in May brought relief to some farm areas, although abnormally dry weather remained the rule in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, Southeast and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> states. 1982: Things were better this year with no extensive areas of drought in the nation as cool Canadian air helped produce active rain fronts during most of the summer. 1983: Searing heat struck in July and August, producing severe drought east of the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>. The drought was similar to that of 1980 but centered slightly farther north, in the western corn belt states. Corn and soybean crops were severely damaged and the dryness extended to the <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> region. Rain was less than one-quarter of normal in parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. 1984: Wheat crops were damaged to the tune of more than $ 1 billion in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> when rainfall totaled only one-third of normal in the first half of the year. Many brush fires were reported. Persistent dryness also damaged crops and gassslands in central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. 1985: Dry conditions led to serious brush and forest fires in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and in the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states. 1986: The Southeast sweltered under dry conditions that had begun the previous autumn. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> were affected by a drought that has been described as the worst in more than a century, less than one-quarter the normal rain falling in some areas. Some relief came in August when rains helped soybean crops, but it was too late for hay and corn. Regional damage estimates topped $ 1 billion. 1987: Forest fires scorched more than two million acres when a dry winter was followed by a sweltering summer in parts of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Water shortages occurred in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> and some other communities. Hot, dry conditions in July and August also contributed to drought conditions in the Southeast, reducing crop yields sharply. Heavy rains came along in September, but excessively dry conditions returned to the Southeast in October and November, particularly affecting <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than a decade after <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> succeeded in growing enough food to feed itself, drought has forced the world's second most populous nation back to the international food markets. The purchases have been small _ a million metric tons of wheat from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 500,000 metric tons of rice from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> _ and are solely to replenish buffer stocks. But they underscore the limits of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s `` green revolution'' of the early 1970s and how reliant on the weather it remains. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s ability to feed itself also is linked to curbing a population that has reached 800 million and is growing at a rate of 2.2 percent a year. The food problems began last summer when the monsoon failed and a drought moved north into prime farming regions, leading to a winter rice harvest about 10 million tons less than that of the previous year. When the rains did come, another wheat crop was in the fields. That harvest was slightly larger than that of the year before, `` but they needed a fantastic crop to make up for the kharif -LRB- winter rice -RRB- failure,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. The government has used its food reserves to make up for the shortfall. Reserves have shrunk from 25 million metric tons in July 1987 to about 9.43 million tons, news and other reports said. A metric ton weighs 2,205 pounds and is equivalent to about 1.1 short tons. `` <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> handled the drought well,'' said the diplomat, an agricultural specialist. `` We've had no reports of deaths.'' The government's problem is getting enough of the wheat now being harvested. Farmers, private traders and flour millers have been working to keep the wheat crop off the market to take advantage of the shrinking national reserves and drive up prices. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> recently quoted <ORGANIZATION> Sukh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ram </ORGANIZATION>, minister of state for food and supply, as warning middlemen about hoarding. Hope is focused on the life-bestowing monsoon due to hit <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> in late June. Western officials expect <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to buy more wheat and rice this year, and the strength of the monsoon will determine how much must be purchased. Problems remain even if the weather cooperates and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s grain production continues its modest increase. The green revolution extended only to wheat and rice, and production lags in other areas, according to Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Asrinivasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sastry </PERSON>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> bought 100,000 metric tons of corn from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> this year and was given 100,000 tons by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Corn imports could total 500,000 tons by the end of the year, the Western diplomat said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> also remains the world's largest importer of edible oils _ 120,000 tons this year _ and also imports soybeans, lentils, butter oil, non-fat dry milk and small amounts of sugar and cotton. Western officials have criticized <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s agriculture extension service, saying it is not getting necessary information to the farmers. But <PERSON> Sastry </PERSON> said it takes time to disseminate information. About 85 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s wheat-growing land is now irrigated, but the diplomat believes more must be done. <PERSON> Sastry </PERSON> said his ministry is working to increase irrigation, improve dry land farming and increase production in states where water is no problem. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s initial green revolution allowed it to grow as much food as the people could buy, but 200 million people _ 25 percent of the population _ do n't have the money to buy enough food and are malnourished. <PERSON> Sastry </PERSON> said increases in rice and wheat production have leveled off in recent years but said he was not worried about population growth outstripping the country's ability to feed itself. `` But if you want to make a significant step up in production ... There will have to be another green revolution,'' he said.

 Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> today urged the government to use caution in involving the military in its war on drugs and said that option should be used primarily as a backup. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> testified before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> about prevention and treatment of drug abuse, and in the session senators lavished him with praise for his outspoken leadership on the subject. In answer to a question from Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, about current sentiment in some quarters for legalization of drugs, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied, `` That would be a mistake. It would be surrender to the No. 1 threat to our national security. We would not think of legalization of smog because there's a lot of it. It's dangerous.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, commenting on the current effort to use the military in drug interdiction, said, `` We must be careful, however, to avoid involving the military in any police actions against citizens or arrests.'' He said strengthening the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and Customs border patrol should be the first priority in interdiction. `` We should not lead with our military forces in drugs or any other aspect of foreign policy. But the military can play a greater and useful role in backing up these efforts and providing intelligence assistance,'' he said. Before the hearing, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> jokingly pinned a large `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 88'' badge on <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s lapel. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, one of the conservative movement's guiding lights, wore the button through the hearing, but joked that `` I thought you were worried sick about the effect it would have on you'' to have such a conservative wearing the badge. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> later met with Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, the only senator who has said he will give <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> his delegate vote at the convention. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said he supports <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because he won <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and he said more Democrats should follow his example `` for the good of the party.'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had changed since 1984, when both of them ran for president. `` I would think <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> frightened the bejesus out of them four years ago. I remember him standing up and saying his time has come! ` I want it all,''' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said. `` This time he's run a winning campaign. He has n't frightened anyone. He's charmed them in all of those different debates and in his own right has leveled off.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he met with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, who has been interviewing potential running mates to join the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor on the Democratic presidential ticket. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a news conference he has not yet decided whether he would want the post, only that he has earned `` serious consideration.'' He made the comments after a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, whose members urged him to seek the post and said they will try to meet with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and lobby him to choose <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would not discuss his meeting with <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> but said it was `` a very meaningful preliminary discussion.'' In a Wednesday evening interview on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> elaborated: `` We simply discussed today the process, discussed the guidelines, we talked about the requirements. After all, we need to know what the rules are, what the standards will be.'' He said he is talking to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> not only about the vice presidency, but about his budget concerns and his proposal to pay for social spending by freezing military spending and hiking taxes on the rich and corporations. He said earlier in the day that his budget priorities are his `` most critical'' concern now that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and he agree on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> policy. `` The most critical becomes this budget, a commitment to invest in people, a commitment to reinvest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said following a meeting with leaders of civil rights groups. He said he is prepared to go to the convention floor if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> balks. `` Of course, that's the proper mechanism and it's the thing to do,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> when asked if he might wage a floor fight. Asked what would happen if he loses the fight, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took a philosophical approach: `` Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. ... If you lose you will at least have left your imprint.'' On the vice presidency issue, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said previously that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will be considered, but not that he will get any special consideration by being runner up. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made clear he would like the offer to be made to him although he has declined to say that in so many words publicly, instead stating that it is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' option.

<HEAD>Birth Control Pills Linked To Increased AIDS Risk In Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prostitutes in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> who use birth control pills are two to three times as likely as other prostitutes to become infected with AIDS, researchers said Thursday. They said it is not known why birth control pills should increase a woman's risk of getting AIDS, but the pills can prouce a condition that might serve as an entry point for the virus into the bloodstream. The risk of getting AIDS through heterosexual contact also increases in people with such diseases as herpes, syphilis and chancroid, all of which produce genital ulcers or lesions, said Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harborview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. Control of these and other genital ulcer diseases `` should be the highest priority for controlling heterosexual AIDS transmission,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said at the Fourth International Conference on AIDS In separate reports, researchers said they found no evidence of mental problems in people who are infected with AIDS but have not developed other signs of the disease. Earlier studies had suggested mental faculties might decline soon after infection with the AIDS virus, and the suggestion was made that infected people who were otherwise healthy should be removed from sensitive jobs. The new research suggests no basis for such action, researchers said. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a fatal disease for which no cure has been found, is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a specialist in sexually transmitted diseases, cited figures from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> showing the number of reported AIDS cases acquired through heterosexual contact had increased from about 1 percent of the total cases in 1983 to almost 4 percent now. Among men, the percentage has increased seven to nine times, from one-tenth of one percent to between seven-tenths and nine-tenths of one percent, he said. In women, the percentage of heterosexually acquired cases is much higher. About 20 percent to 30 percent of AIDS cases in women in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were probably acquired through heterosexual contact, he said. The problem is especially severe among minorities in the inner cities, the areas where prostitution and intravenous drug abuse are concentrated, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. `` Programs for prevention of heterosexual transmission of HIV via sex with prostitutes are urgently needed in all countries,'' he said. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> recommended starting the programs in early adolescence because, `` If you wait until 18 to give the lecture on AIDS, it's too late. The association of genital ulcer disease and birth control pills with AIDS comes from studies by <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> and others in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> told the conference. He said the pills can produce a condition called cervical ectopy in which part of the cervical lining is exposed to the vagina, and the explosed lining might be an entry point for the AIDS virus into the bloodstream. Genital ulcer disease presumably increases the AIDS risk by allowing the virus to enter the body through the ulcers, he said. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the leading causes of genital ulcer disease are herpes, syphilis and chancroid in that order, but in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> the bacterial infection chancroid is first. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> also noted that the sexually transmitted disease called chlamydia also may increase the risk of contracting AIDS. As a consequence, he said, controlling sexually transmitted disease is crucial in the fight against AIDS. `` AIDS prevention without sexually transmitted-disease control in a meaningful way is a blueprint for disaster,'' he said. The study of the effects of AIDS infection on the brain involved observation and examination of 201 people for two years, slightly more than half of whom were infected with the AIDS virus. They were examined every six months. `` We're not seeing any difference whatsoever in terms of a number of psychological measures known to be sensitive to virtually any form of brain damage,'' said one of the authors, Dr. <PERSON> Ola </PERSON> <PERSON> Selnes </PERSON>, a psychologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The study by <PERSON> Selnes </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON>, also of <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, found no basis for the concern that had been expressed about people in sensitive jobs, <PERSON> Selnes </PERSON> said. `` Based on our results, we do not feel there is any cause for alarm or concern,'' <PERSON> Selnes </PERSON> said. The study was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases. Researchers generally agree that mental problems do appear late in the progression of AIDS. Autopsies have shown about 70 percent of those who die of AIDS have significant mental and neurological problems after other symptoms develop, said a report released in March by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles today blocked the execution of <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> six hours before he was to die in the electric chair for raping and stabbing to death a woman in 1977. The five-member board suspended the execution for up to 90 days to decide whether <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' life should be spared. Although the board could lift the suspension at any time, board chairman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> said he expected it would take at least that long to make a decision. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 30, would have been the second murderer put to death in the nation in two days and the 101st since resumption of capital punishment in 1977. The board, which conducted a hearing Wednesday, is the only non-judicial state entity with the authority to commute a death sentence. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' execution order expires at noon Tuesday. If the suspension remains in effect beyond then, the state will have to seek a new execution order. Snow said the decision was prompted by questions over <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' role in the killing, a new trial granted an alleged accomplice and the accomplice's recantation of incriminating testimony Earlier today, the 11th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> denied without comment a request for a stay, and attorneys appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The execution was scheduled for 7 p.m. at the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diagnostic </ORGANIZATION> and Classification Center near <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was sentenced to death for the 1977 rape and stabbing of <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON>, whose neighbor <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Spraggins </PERSON> also was convicted and sentenced to death in the case. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was 19 at the time of the slaying. <PERSON> Spraggins </PERSON>, who was the prime witness against <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, won a new trial after his lawyers argued that the judge failed to properly inform the jury that his I.Q. was 65. <PERSON> Spraggins </PERSON> has recanted his 1977 testimony against <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Senators Hit Administration Plan To Sell Advanced Weapons to
Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Several senators Thursday attacked a proposed $ 1.9 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons sale to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> that includes advanced fighter planes and an array of bombs and air-to-ground missiles. It is `` inconceivable'' that the administration would contemplate such a large sale to a country which is so small and has been on less than friendly terms with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> until recently, Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., told Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> also said he feared that the sale would make some of the most advanced weapons in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenal accessible to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said he was concerned that the F-A-18 fighter-bomber, the most sophisticated plane of its type in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenal, could be outfitted with larger fuel tanks that could render it capable of attacking <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Concern also was expressed by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis., and <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., at the hearing of the Approprations subcommittee on foreign <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> defended the proposed sale, saying it represented `` a political breakthrough'' for the Kuwaitis to tie themselves to American technology and to take responsibility for their own defense. He said <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> is vulnerable to attack from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and that the weapons would not have the range to reach <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. And he said the sale agreement would have adequate controls to prevent access to the weapons by the Soviets. `` In our judgment, this is a positive development,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` The mission is if there is an attack by ground or sea from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, they can do something to counter that.'' He said some of the alternative aircraft that had been considered by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to replace its aging fleet would have had a longer range sufficient to reach <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The administration has notified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> informally that it intends to make the sale, including 40 F-A-18 fighters, 40 harpoon missiles, 120 heat-seeking Sidewinder and 200 radar-guided Sparrow air-to-air missiles, 300 air-to-ground <ORGANIZATION> Mavericks </ORGANIZATION>, 200 cluster bombs and 400 laser-guided bombs. Following a 20-day informal notification period, the administration will submit a formal notification to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the sale and lawmakers will have 30 days to pass a joint resolution disapproving the transaction.

The administration was forced to drop <ORGANIZATION> Mavericks </ORGANIZATION> from a weapons sale to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> last October, and <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> if the same might be done in the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> sale. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> responded that the Maverick is `` especially effective'' and was included in the sale to make the aircraft functional. He said the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> sale was not comparable to the Saudi sale because the Saudis already had <ORGANIZATION> Mavericks </ORGANIZATION>, and were seeking additional ones. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> currently has none, he said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a group of honored high school seniors Thursday that they and their Soviet counterparts must `` bring peoples of other cultures together'' in a comman bond of humanity. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, addressing the winners of the Presidential Scholars Medallion, advised the students to `` stand forthrightly for the values of our whole way of life and what it is based upon.'' The president, who noted that he had spoken to students from <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> during the recent U.S.-Soviet summit, said it was vital that Americans learn `` the importance of the values implicit in civilization and the need to teach and transmit from generation to generation a moral education.''' `` Loyalty, faithfulness, commitment, courage, patriotism, the ability to distinguish between right and wrong _ I hope that these values are as much a part of your life as any calculus course or social science study,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the students. The president said he found few differences between the young people in he had addressed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the youngsters before him in the Rose Garden, and that `` it's just our governments that are based on different principles.'' `` And that's the job before you and those students in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the remainder of this century and into the next one,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` To bring peoples of other cultures together in that common bond of humanity.'' He added that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students must also learn `` to speak for freedom; to argue for democracy; and always to bear in mind those fundamental, moral distinctions between systems of government that believe in the dignity of the individual and others systems that simply see the individual as a cog in the great machine of the state.'' The presidential scholars program was established in 1964. This year, some 139 students were chosen _ 121 on the basis of academic achievements, leadership qualities and community involvement. The other 18 were recognized for superior accomplishments in the arts as well as academic performance, the White House said.

 The son of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> was sentenced today to four months in jail for selling $ 25 worth of cocaine to an undercover police officer two years ago. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 24, and his parents stood stoically as Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> handed down the sentence in <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rutland </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't in good conscience sentence you without any time to serve,'' <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> said. The sentence also includes 300 hours of community service and a $ 1,500 fine. `` We are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the sentence,'' <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said, noting that other defendants in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> drug cases have received lighter penalties. `` We'll continue on our way with an appeal. We love our son,'' she said. A tearful <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> had asked <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> not to treat her son differently than any other person convicted of selling a quarter of a gram of cocaine. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, who ran on the Democratic ticket in 1984, said her son's arrest and conviction has taken a heavy toll on her family and her son. `` He does n't go to church with us,'' she said in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>. `` He does n't want to be seen with us. It's not because he's ashamed of us. It's because he's ashamed of what he's done. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> told <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> in a quivering voice that he has sworn off drugs. `` I'd like to make a personal pledge to you and my family that I will never again be involved in drugs or any illegality,'' he told <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> suggested that the jail time be served through the <ORGANIZATION> Chittenden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> so that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> could participate in a special corrections program that allows him to be kept under house arrest. However, <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said later that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> would have to be accepted into the program. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> is free during the 30 days he has to appeal the sentence. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> faced up to five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. His attorney, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON>, had asked <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> to accept a probation officer's recommendation of a suspended sentence, probation and community service of unspecified length. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> recommended a jail term, citing the deterrent effect on drug cases in society. He did not specify the length, but said afterward he was pleased with the sentence. He denied that he had treated the case differently. `` This was a case in which we caught someone red-handed, and I mean red-handed,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. `` I felt that it was important for the court to say it does n't matter who you are. If you commit a drug offense in the state of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, you'll be treated with great severity.'' Also at the sentencing hearing, the founder of <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> shelter for runaways, said he believes that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> has learned from his mistakes and should not be imprisoned. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> has worked as a volunteer for the shelter in a program that brings runaways, child prostitutes and other children from the streets to the center. `` You ca n't try and reach these kids ... without coming into a far better and deeper understanding of your own value system,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>. `` Probably the most important things we learn are from our mistakes. <PERSON> John </PERSON> has learned them.'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said earlier that he wants the sentence to be noticed to deter other drug sellers and users. `` If you want to get a message out to people, you certainly want to send that in a high-profile case,'' the prosecutor said. `` We need to educate people about the horrors of drugs and if that does n't work, at least scare them away because of the possibility of legal sanction.'' At the hearing, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> what message the sentence should send regarding drug use. `` I doubt that incarceration of <PERSON> John </PERSON> would be much of a deterrent to anyone,'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> replied. `` Incarceration for <PERSON> John </PERSON> right now would be more in line of society seeking retribution rather than deterrence.'' Also testifying this morning was former <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wemette </PERSON>, who said that while investigating the case he found highly sophisticated scales on <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s desk. `` He needs no more punishment,'' <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said of her son in a letter written to <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON>. `` He has been publicly ` flogged' on national and international TV.'' `` He will never touch drugs again and maybe someday I'll even say it was a blessing in disguise,'' <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> wrote. `` Right now, it still hurts too much to do so.'' <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> has grown into `` a mature, much quieter, much more self-conscious adult'' since his arrest, <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> wrote. The letter is among 30 that <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> has received before sentencing <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>. The contents of the letters are a part of the court record. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s 1984 running mate, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, also put in a good word for <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, said court clerk <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingler </PERSON>. `` I saw him as a very fine young man who quickly became good friends with our children and who campaigned in a spirited and strong way around our nation,'' said <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was convicted by a jury in April in <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rutland </LOCATION>. He was arrested in February 1986 after selling $ 25 worth of cocaine to undercover agent <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> while he was attending <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> testified that she went to <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s off-campus home and inquired about buying cocaine. She said <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> produced a tray of cocaine packets from underneath the living room sofa. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was arrested that night outside the restaurant where he worked. <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> had been entrapped, saying police had used <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> as bait to snare him during a college party weekend. The prosecution denied the charge. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> had filed a motion asking that he be allowed to introduce at the hearing photographs of evidence seized from <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s car. Police said the evidence included $ 1,600 in cash, 8 grams of cocaine and records of drug transactions. The evidence was excluded two years ago when <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> ruled police had insufficient evidence when they obtained the warrant to search <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s car. On Wednesday, a judge denied <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s motion, setting the stage for today's sentencing. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> wrote about his work at <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the March issue of Women's Day magazine, describing at length the experiences of children on the streets and his decision to volunteer. `` When I told my parents, they were pleased. When I told my lawyers, they were not. They knew it meant my dealing with drug users. It would not be good for my image. I laughed,'' he wrote. `` There were kids who needed help. ... I've been lucky. These kids never had a fair chance.''

<TEXT>
 Elder statesman <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> said Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> made a mistake when it pushed him off its slate for the November elections to make room for political newcomers deemed more attractive to voters. <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, 73, fell victim a new selection system in which for the first time the rank-and-file, not party bosses, chose the slate for the elections to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>. Half the candidates elected Wednesday were political newcomers, and Labor's general secretary, <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Baram </PERSON>, called the outcome a `` revolution'' and `` feast for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s democracy.'' `` It's clearly a disappointment,'' <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` During the years I have accumulated valuable knowledge and experience. I told party members I'm ready to offer this, but if you do n't want it, I wo n't.'' During his 40-year political career, <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> served as deputy prime minister, foreign minister and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>'s ouster was a `` real tragedy, not for him, but for the country. `` I've never known anyone else who I thought had made a greater contribution to his country,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Political analyst <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Galnoor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> might have retained his position had the party bosses formed the slate, but the new selection process showed he `` does n't have a following in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' `` Eban is not connected to any influential groups. He's just a bright guy with a terrific sense of humor. Unfortunately, these things are not very admired in Israeli politics,'' said <PERSON> Galnoor </PERSON>, a political scientist at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Party members did not choose <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ranked list of candidates for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>. The number of parliament seats assigned to a party depends on its total vote in the elections. Based on previous election results, Labor candidates in the top 40 to 45 slots are expected to be re-elected. Eleven slots, including the top seven reserved for party leaders, were filled by appointment, not popular vote. Twenty-one of the remaining 34 slots considered `` safe'' were given to newcomers. Four of the newcomers were Sephardic Jews from North African nations, a group that has traditionally voted for Labor's political rival, the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. <PERSON> Galnoor </PERSON> said the selection might improve <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s chances in the election, but also said such gains could be offset if Labor does n't deliver a clear message on how it will solve the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict Polls have indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> might lose the election to <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> because many voters have moved to the right in response to the 6-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leaders say <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will never withdraw from the occupied territories. Labor advocates the return of some land in exchange for peace, but opposes formation of a Palestinian state or the dismantling of Jewish settlements.

 Hundreds of thousands of blacks stayed away from work today to commemorate the 1976 <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> riots. An explosion killed one man, firebombs wounded three others and a commuter railway was bombed. Police reported the deaths of 11 suspected <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in the past week, including the man killed today by explosives he was carrying near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The man was not identified. Another suspected guerrilla died in an accidental blast Tuesday, and nine were killed by police in two shootouts near the <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> border in the past week, Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said. The state-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said police were tipped off that Mozambique-based guerrillas would try to enter <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> to stage `` massive acts of terrorism.'' In each case, it said, police stopped vehicles at roadblocks and riddled them with bullets after someone inside opened fire. Many factories shut down, and the largest daily newspaper for blacks, The Sowetan, did not publish. Workers at three diamond mines went on strike to demand that June 16 be designated a paid holiday. The unrest came on the 12th anniversary of a police attack on marching schoolchildren in the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. Ten people, including two children, died that June 16. The confrontation prompted a nationwide rampage in which hundreds were killed. Commemorative church services were held in many black townships. Security forces reportedly fired tear gas and bird shot because of stone-throwing that occurred as blacks left a church service in <LOCATION> Lamontville </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Langa </LOCATION>, a black township outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, a commuter rail line was bombed at midday. Police headquarters said two officers on patrol flagged down a train approaching the wrecked section of track, averting a possible derailment. Trains coming from <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> reportedly were stoned. Firebombs were thrown at three buses and two delivery vans in other townships, causing serious injuries to three blacks. The main power line between the black township of <ORGANIZATION> KwaMashu </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> was sabotaged during the night, stopping rail traffic for several hours. Later, a train on the route was derailed and commuters had to be transferred to buses. The nation's largest ports were operating normally, but in the eastern <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> province half the workers were absent at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and there was a total boycott at Port Elizabeth docks. Mining company officials said only 24,500 of 540,000 black employees at major mines were absent. The De Beers mining company said black workers disrupted operations at three mines with a strike to demand that June 16 be designated a paid holiday. It is illegal under national emergency regulations to call for or participate in boycotts or illegal strikes, but many blacks have become accustomed to observing June 16 as a holiday. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, there are no public holidays commemorating events of specific significance to the 26 million black majority. Many stores and shops in downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> were closed, and only a handful of buses and taxi-vans were operating in the city. Trains arriving from <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and other nearby black townships were nearly empty. The streets of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> were almost deserted. About 100 people were scattered along the main road trying to hitch rides. Most of the township's 2.5 million residents appeared to have slept late. The normally teeming main bus station was vacant. About 15 people gathered this morning in Avalon Cemetery at the grave of <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Pieterson </PERSON>, a 13-year-old boy shot by police during the student march in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> in 1976. <PERSON> Pieterson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Margot </PERSON>, 17, and his nephew, <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabane </PERSON>, 6, put flowers on the grave, which bears a marker saying: `` Deeply mourned by his parents, sisters, and a nation that remembers.'' <PERSON> Popi </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, 29, a young girl who was hurt in the 1976 shootings, came to the graveside service in a wheelchair. The <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> students had been protesting the use of Afrikaans, the language of descendants of Dutch settlers, in their schools. The shooting touched off a nationwide rampage in which, by official count, 575 blacks were killed. The following month, the government announced that blacks could choose the language of instruction in their schools. The anniversary has almost always been marked by violence, particularly confrontations between black crowds and police trying to halt observances. Last year, 11 people died despite a call by anti-apartheid groups for a quiet observances. Slogans were painted on the walls of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, saying, `` <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, Free Us,'' `` South Africa Bleeds,'' and `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Will </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liberate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The slogans were painted in yellow, green and black, the colors of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement.

 Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, the only senator who has endorsed <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said Thursday the Democratic presidential candidate has run a winning campaign in 1988 that has n't frightened voters as it did four years ago. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, who joined fellow <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolinian </LOCATION> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> news conference, said the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> candidacy of 1988 is markedly different from his 1984 campaign. `` I would think <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> frightened the bejesus out of them four years ago. I remember him standing up and saying his time has come! ` I want it all,''' said <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, who made an unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1984. `` This time he's run a winning campaign. He has n't frightened anyone. He's charmed them in all of those different debates and in his own right has leveled off,'' he said. People are `` looking at <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> not as a black but really for his own philosophy with respect to hunger and nutrition and jobs and drugs and everything else,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said. `` That's why I think he's won support black and white and from <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> down to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. It's a substantially different campaign'' than four years ago. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, who announced last week that he will vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, said that although <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` the obvious winner'' of the party's presidential race, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has earned his support. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> also urged other `` super delegates'' whose states and districts were won by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to join him in voting for the candidate. Super delegates are the unpledged public and party officeholders who will attend the convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, July 18-21. `` The obvious winner is Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. For the good of the party, we also ought to be supporting <PERSON> Reverand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. That's why coming from my home state, he won my home state, he certainly has earned my vote'' at the convention, <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said. Other Democratic senators met with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> but no endorsement was forthcoming. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, ignoring rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' mathematical lock on the Democratic nomination, has said he will seek out the support of the super delegates. And he has repeatedly pointed to <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> as an example for other super delegates. The senator, in announcing his decision last week, said he wanted to honor a native <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolinian </LOCATION> and join the delegates supporting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said he is not willing to concede the nomination to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` My priority at this point is to seek the nomination,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> insisted. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holds a commanding 2-to-1 lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate count, and leads by a wide margin in the number of super delegates _ 348 to 54. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s super delegates include 20 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and just one member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>. Only three of his super delegates are white. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s 348 super delegates include 62 non-whites.

<HEAD>Pope Urges Rebel Archbishop Not to Consecrate Bishops</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has urged Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> to abandon a consecration of bishops that would split the church and probably get the rebel traditionalist excommunicated, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said Thursday. Creating bishops without papal permission is against canon. It seems a certain path to expulsion from the Roman Catholic Church for the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> archbishop, who has rebelled for two decades against what he calls `` self-destructive'' changes in the church. Without being specific, the pope reminded <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> by letter of `` the inevitable theological and canonical consequences that are known to you.'' Leaders of the church in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> issued a joint statement Thursday urging <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> to `` to change his decision and we pray that he does not commit the unrepairable.'' The last schism in the church occurred in 1870 over the dogma of papal infallibity. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, 82-year-old founder of the traditionalist <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> X </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternity </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, said Wednesday he would consecrate four followers as bishops June 30. The fraternity was named after <PERSON> Piux </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON>, who was pope in 1903-14 and who condemned religious modernism. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said in a statement Thursday that, in a May 5 protocol worked out by <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, the pontiff gave the archbishop permission to consecrate one bishop Aug. 15. Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> barred <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> in 1976 from saying Mass and giving the sacraments, but the archbishop has ordained more than 200 priests who continue to use the 16th century Tridentine Mass, a Latin rite for which special permission is required. His movement claims millions of followers worldwide. According to the statement Thursday, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> issued a `` pressing appeal to members of -LRB- <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s -RRB- Fraternity and their followers ... to rethink their position and remain united'' with the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>, `` assuring them that all measures will be taken to guarantee their identity in full communion with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.'' Noting <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s announcement `` with profound pain,'' the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> issued a chronology Thursday of its efforts in the past seven months to resolve the dispute. It also published the texts of the protocol and letters between the the archbishop and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. Under the protocol, <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> would have promised tobe faithful to the church and <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and to accept the teachings of the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65. The council simplified and modernized the liturgy, instituting such reforms as celebration of the Mass in the local language. The protocol required <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s recognition of the `` validity of the Mass and the sacraments ... according to the rites ... promulgated by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> and by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>,'' but would allow the archbishop to use liturgy antedating the council. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> wrote to Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON>, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the day after the protocol insisting that consecration of the bishop take place June 30, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said. When his request was refused, it said, <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> wrote to the cardinal and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> renewing both his demand for June 30 and a previous proposal that four bishops be consecrated. At one point in the exchange of correspondence with the pope, <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> said: `` The false ecumenism which lies at the origin of all the innovations, in liturgy, in new relations between the church and the world, in the conception of the church itself, leads the church to its ruin and Catholics to apostasy.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> responded: `` From a paternal heart, but with all the gravity required by the present circumstances, I exhort you, Venerable Brother, to renounce your plan, which, if realized, could only appear as a schismatic act whose inevitable theological and canonical consequences are known to you.''

<HEAD>Minister Vows To Continue Bethel After Release On Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUCEDALE, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Baptist minister who runs a children's home the state ordered shut down vowed to keep it open as he was released on bond on charges of assaulting a police officer. The Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, posting $ 40,000 bail on three felony counts, walked out late Wednesday and said, `` I plan to continue like I always have.'' <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for Children, operated by <ORGANIZATION> Fountain </ORGANIZATION>'s independent Baptist group, was ordered closed down June 10 when a judge ruled its residents were subjected to `` physical abuse, medical neglect and detention amounting to imprisonment.'' State welfare officials have taken custody of a total of 77 children, ages 10 to 17, from the home. About 50 have been released to their parents and the status of the others is pending. Meanwhile, Welfare Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said he had hidden his 13-year-old daughter because of kidnapping threats following the closure of <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said he decided to hide his daughter after callers talked of kidnapping and putting her in a home such as <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. Fountain, 38, was arrested Monday when officers went to the campus church to search for children who had run off when the home was shut down. He was accused of scuffling with some of the officers who were serving subpoenas on staff members. Before state welfare workers arrived at the home June 10 to take custody of the children, most had fled. Law officers later found about 60 children hiding at private residences and roaming the streets of <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>. About 60 state troopers and local law officers raided Fountain's church Monday to search for others. Eleven children were taken into custody at that time. Fountain has refused to give the state a list of the children that were at the home. He also has said he has taken in an additional child since the court order. The state has required that parents or guardians to regain custody must sign a statment promising not to send the children back to <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>.

 A 32-year-old man was in stable condition Thursday after he was impaled on a wrought-iron fence and had to be rushed to the hospital on a flat-bed truck with the fence spike sticking through his leg, authorities said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, whose last known address was a shelter in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, was found hanging from the fence he was climbing with a spearlike iron spike stuck through his leg below his knee. A security guard called police early Wednesday to report a man yelling from behind <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, police said. The spike was about 2 inches thick at the top and the tip was pointed, making its extraction extremely difficult, police said. Rescuers cut a section of about 3 feet square using blowtorches.

 A leading Soviet film director visiting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> praised books banned in his country, said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> should renew ties with the Jewish state and showed <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> immigrants his latest movie. <PERSON> Eldar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryazanov </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinematographers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, also told about 1,000 Soviet Jews at Wednesday night's screening that some political emigrants should be pardoned and allowed to visit the land of their birth. <PERSON> Ryazanov </PERSON> hailed <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as `` the most humane leader'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in decades. He cited reforms that allowed him and his wife to visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ryazonov </PERSON> is the highest-ranking Soviet artist to come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since such visits became possible about a year ago. Travel from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was barred after the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> severed ties in 1967, and Soviet artists who did visit the West usually traveled without their families. `` But it's very tragic to spend a lifetime before starting to enjoy freedom,'' said <PERSON> Ryazanov </PERSON>. The 60-year-old filmmaker, who is known for satirical comedies, greeted former compatriots in halting Hebrew and won applause as he said ties between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should be restored. <PERSON> Ryazanov </PERSON> then switched to native Russian to praise <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, but almost in the same breath said he just resigned from a job at the Soviet Television in protest over state censorship Answering written questions, he praised books by exiled Nobel Prize winner <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, who now lives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and called `` The Gulag Archipelago'' `` a work of vast social importance.'' <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s books are banned in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Ryazanov </PERSON> omitted the writer's name when he said some political emigrants _ such as theater director <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON>, who took Israeli citizenship, and writers <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Aksyonov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Naum </PERSON> <PERSON> Korzavin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ should get back their Soviet citizenship. `` They should be able to choose where to live while being able to travel freely to their homeland,'' <PERSON> Ryazanov </PERSON> said. `` Freedom to travel ... is as natural as freedom to breathe.'' He noted that the airplane that brought him to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was packed with Soviet Jews visiting emigrant relatives in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` They could not see their relatives for years. There were embraces, tears, and one could n't watch it calmly.'' In recent months, hundreds of Soviet Jews have been allowed to visit relatives in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and some immigrants are permitted to travel to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also allowed 4,695 Jews to emigrate this year. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> officially estimates as many as 380,000 want to leave, but an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> delegation leader who recently visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> put the figure at 25,000. <PERSON> Ryazanov </PERSON> said that he tried `` to use freedom as much as possible'' in his 1987 romantic comedy `` Forgotten Melody For A Flute,'' which was screened for the Israeli audience. The movie is about a Soviet bureaucrat who is married to a woman he does n't love but whose influential father promises to help his career. The hero must decide whether to remain married or run off with a poor nurse he loves. `` At last Soviet lovers have sex,'' said one immigrant viewer, referring to a scene in which the adulterous couple is shown naked in bed. Others praised the film for making fun of Soviet censorship and influence peddling.

 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> warned Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is losing its position as leader of the world's industrial nations because it is spending less now on technical research and development. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, in a speech prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, said the nation is `` just now beginning to recognize a long-term drought in the national technical capability.'' For instance, he said, the American machine tool industry `` has been swamped'' by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market share of civil aircraft has dropped to 65 percent `` and promises to continue its decline.'' `` We have focused on marketing old products in newer packages at the expense of investments in innovation and evolutionary improvements,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator said. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said the federal investment in aeronautics and space research and development has declined, causing <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to be less bold in its technological innovation and exploration of the unknown. `` This is the wrong direction for leadership,'' he said. `` This is living off the advances of the past _ in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s case, of the Apollo era.'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said that if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trends continue in technology, `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the nation will become net consumers, not producers, of science and the technology it makes possible. If that occurs, the climb back to any position of parity in world affairs will be arduous indeed, and certainly not certain of success.''

 The Kremlin on Thursday stepped up its campaign for information on 300 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers missing in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> appealed for the return of prisoners held by Afghan guerrillas. <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Venediktov </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> societies, appealed for help from the governments of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well as from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s guerrillas, who according to one estimate are holding up to 250 Soviets prisoner On Monday, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> summoned the <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to ask for help finding missing soldiers and freeing POWs. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Venediktov </PERSON> as saying he had made similar requests to the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` The reply to the first request has said the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> does not know if there are Soviet POWs -LRB- prisoners of war -RRB- in that country. A response to the second request has yet to come,'' <PERSON> Venediktov </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, told reporters Monday that previous appeals to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had led to the release of some Soviet prisoners, but he did say when or how many. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> continued to channel U.S.-supplied arms to the guerrillas, which he said violated the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords on an Afghan settlement. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday, expatriate Soviet artist <PERSON> Mihail </PERSON> <PERSON> Chemiakin </PERSON> and American writers, scholars and religious figures announced the formation of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> of Russian Prisoners of War in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The only Soviet citizen on the committee, <PERSON> Iona </PERSON> <PERSON> Andronov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> correspondent for the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, said that 250 of the missing Soviets were being held by the guerrillas. A statement from the committee, distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` even some Americans unfriendly to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, after visiting the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, have told of the killing of Soviet POWs, how prior to their execution the young men's eyes were torn out, their noses, ears and genitals cut off.'' `` Sometimes, the doomed prisoners are skinned alive,'' the statement asserted. `` American eyewitnesses also inform us that those POWs who have survived so far are chained hand and foot and held underground in constant darkness.'' The Soviets have said they had 100,300 soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> before they began pulling them out May 15. Under the terms of the U.N.-sponsored agreement on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in April, half of the Soviet troops are supposed to be home by Aug. 15 and the remainder by Feb. 15. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that seven people were killed and 13 were wounded by rockets fired by Afghan guerrillas into a residential neighborhood of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The agency, in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, gave few details of the attack, which occurred Wednesday night, except to say that the dead included women and children and that several houses were destroyed.

 Mortars and rockets whizzed through two refugee camps in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Thursday, leaving 12 people dead and 29 injured as rival <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> groups fought for control of the areas. In southeast <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers killed two Lebanese guerrillas in an ambush on the western slopes of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION>, police said. Police said the new casualties in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> brought the toll to 31 people killed and 130 wounded since the latest clashes over the <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh refugee camps broke out last week. The thuds of exploding shells resounded as ambulances evacuated casualties from the two shantytowns on the southern outskirts of the Lebanese capital. The <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> accused the breakaway faction called Fatah-Uprising of indiscriminate shelling. The group rebelled against <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s leadership with Syrian backing in May 1983. A spokesman for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s group, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rival group was shelling both refugee camps from the outside. He said his group repulsed several attacks. A police spokesman said <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> rebels shelled the camps from Syrian-controlled territory in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the seaside suburb of <LOCATION> Ouzai </LOCATION>. The police spokesman confirmed Fatah-Uprising tried but failed to enter the camps. The fighting raged despite efforts by a committee of representatives from seven neutral Palestinian groups to supervise a cease-fire. In southeast <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> gunners and helicopter gunships attacked the terrain north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone while pursuing a guerrilla group, another police spokesman said. He said the hunt by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and their militia allies, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, ended when two guerrillas from the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were killed in an ambush north of the security zone. The spokesman, who can not be identified according to police regulations, said an Israeli patrol set up the ambush overnight north of the zone and confronted the communist group as it left to carry out an attack in the zone.

<TEXT>
 More than 1,000 coal miners hooted and cheered as union leaders and miners denounced proposed federal safety rule changes at a public hearing Thursday. The hearing was punctuated by catcalls, shouts and standing ovations from the miners, who union officials said were on a contract-sanctioned day off from 87 mines in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> is staging rallies at public hearings on the proposed changes being conducted around the country by the <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday's hearing was the fourth of six planned. `` Excuse me,'' said moderator <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvey </PERSON>, trying to quiet the crowd. `` This will be an orderly proceeding.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 12 in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, also appealed for order, then accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of putting the interests of mine owners before safety. `` Their position is that they want to get government out of industry,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` Now surely a coal operator, for example, should know how to operate his mine. But deregulation has not been effective.'' Some miners carried signs reading, `` We give our sweat but not our blood,'' and `` Laws to live by, not die by.'' The proposals on underground mine ventilation include elimination of required 20-minute checks for methane gas, an increase in the allowable limits of methane and a lifting of the requirement that miners be evacuated whenever ventilation fans break down. Representatives from the federal agency maintained that the proposed changes partly reflect improvements in mine monitoring systems. `` We included several new provisions in the proposals that we think would be definite -LRB- safety -RRB- improvements,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Silvey </PERSON>, director of the agency's Office of Standards, Regulations and Variances. She said the changes include a provision for electronic systems that continuously monitor mine air for methane and oxygen deficiencies. Miner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danner </PERSON>, from nearby <LOCATION> Newburgh </LOCATION>, said methane fire is one of the miners' greatest fears. He recalled an accident at the <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, mine where he worked 15 years ago. `` We had an ignition and a roll of fire came across the man from a pocket of gas,'' <PERSON> Danner </PERSON> said. `` It did n't kill him, but it charred him black. It's a horrible site if you've ever seen a man who's just been burned to a crisp.'' The union contends the rule changes were designed primarily to save mining companies money. However, testimony from companies at previous hearings indicates that use of the electronic air monitoring system does not guarantee higher profits, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuetenhorst </PERSON>, a deputy director in the federal mining regulations office.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> endorsed the idea of a special counsel to investigate <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on Thursday and said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was willing to go along in contrast `` to the kind of stonewalling we've had from the administration.'' Asked about <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as he opened a Southern campaign swing, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he understood the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat had `` welcomed the independent counsel.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he would welcome the hiring of an outside investigator by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee if that would speed up the panel's probe of his financial dealings. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> to receive the endorsement of Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, one of his former rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. During the primary campaign, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had compared <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to the Democratic presidential candidates who had lost four of the past five national elections. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who dropped out of the race after losing badly in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, said, `` I think that <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' image in the South and all over the country is very different than many people thought it was going to be when this campaign began.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> differed strongly with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on defense and foreign policy issues during the campaign. But he said Thursday, `` I was pleased to see not only <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but all of us learning from each other.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, when asked if he hoped to get a similar endorsement from <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> before the Democratic convention next month, said, `` I would hope <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will be a part of this campaign and as early as possible.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has vowed to continue his campaign until the convention roll call that decides the nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> already has far more than the delegates he needs for a majority on that roll call. Asked if he was concerned at the prospect of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> presiding over the convention at the same time he was under investigation, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I thought there was a presumption of innocence in this country, certainly one I believe in.'' At the same time, he said he has called for Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to resign. `` I certainly have,'' said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. `` That's after repeated evidence of insensitivity, a lack of awareness of what we mean when we talk about high standards.'' `` If you're attorney general of this country and you've stumbled as often as he has and made as many mistakes as he has and provided as weak leadership as he has, you ought to leave office,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He said that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s attitude toward the idea of an independent counsel `` contrasts rather sharply with the kind of stonewalling we've had from the administration on case after case after case.'' He said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s approach was `` the way that we ought to respond to these kind of things.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he was confident <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would carry five or six states in the South against Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

 Radical mobs shouting about government corruption attacked riot squads Thursday, and police said they arrested six students who tried to throw firebombs at the home of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. Fighting began at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> when police fired volleys of tear gas to keep 1,000 radicals from five nearby schools from marching off the campus. Students hurled firebombs and rocks for two hours, screaming `` Punish criminals!'' `` Yankee go home!'' and other demands for withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. Anti-Americanism has become a strong element in recent protests by the radical students, who contend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enforces partition of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and treats the South as a colony. Twenty students throwing firebombs dashed toward <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s home Wednesday night, but tear gas stopped them 150 yards short of the target and six were arrested, police reported. They said the students flung six firebombs at riot officers and a nearby police post afterward, shouting: `` Investigate corruption under the former government!'' No damage or injuries were reported. Police seized 48 firebombs and leaflets accusing <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> of corruption and abuse of power during his seven years in office, which ended in February. They demanded a full investigation and punishment. Accusations of corruption and embezzlement of funds have been made against <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and members of his family since he left office. The political opposition also claims <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, a former general put in power by the army, was responsible for numerous cases of torture and brutality. Radical students accuse <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>; President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, a fellow general who succeeded him; and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of responsibility for military repression of a 1980 civil uprising in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. Nearly 200 people were killed, according to government figures. Minor clashes were reported Thursday in <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION>, another southern city, between police and students denouncing the blockade of a march to the border with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Much larger battles occurred Jun 10 when police stopped thousands of radicals from marching to the border for meetings with North Korean students on reunifying the peninsula, which was divided in 1945. In another development, Chief Justice <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong-chun </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday he would resign in response to calls by junior magistrates for judicial reform. On Wednesday, 85 judges issued a statement saying the judiciary is seen as subservient to the government and has not benefited from recent democratic changes. It was the first such collective action by judges in the nation's history. Another 194 judges joined in a supporting statement Thursday and support for the demand is expected to continue growing among the 940 magistrates in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are running neck-and-neck in the South but the tide could turn quickly against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he selects <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as his running mate, a poll released Thursday showed. Democratic pollster <PERSON> Claibourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the survey of 750 voters in nine Southern states found that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and the vice president are in a statistical tie among traditionally conservative Southern voters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the choice of 45.1 percent, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 42.3 percent and 12.7 percent were undecided. The telephone poll was conducted June 8-13 among voters in what <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> described as the `` hard-core Southern states'' of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The margin of error was 3.6 percent. `` It's a horse race, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is on shaky ground,'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said. Of the people surveyed who said they would vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` four of 10 are for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> not because of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but because they dislike <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. ... An ` anti' vote early in a campaign is based on personality, and can leave you very quickly,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, among other things, must `` learn to speak English,'' by bringing his vocabulary down to earth, <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said. With the two likely nominees running neck-and-neck, the vice presidential choice becomes critical, <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said. For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to choose <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` would be disastrous in the South,'' the pollster said. Only 25.8 percent said the selection of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for the No. 2 spot would make them more inclined to vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, while 53.1 percent said they would be less inclined to vote Democratic. Some 21.2 percent were undecided. `` I think everyone has to be surprised at how well <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is doing in the South,'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said, but he added that because it is based largely on an anti-Bush sentiment, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, himself, is doing more to break the Republican ` lock' on the South than <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is doing.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are investigating allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> security guards stationed in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> improperly fraternized with <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> women, officials said Thursday. The investigation focuses on four Marines and their off-duty social activities and does not involve any allegations of espionage, the officials said. Two years ago, a similiar fraternization scandal erupted involving Marine guards at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. One Marine was convicted of espionage. `` Right now, there is no indication of the four of them being involved in anything except fraternization,'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shotwell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said of the latest case. `` And the investigation is still continuing.'' The Pentagon, in a brief statement, said the four guards `` have been returned to their parent unit, the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION>, located at <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>,'' pending completion of the investigation. `` Four Marine security guards assigned to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic post in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Interest Section, co-located with the Swiss embassy, are suspected of fraternization with local civilians in violation of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy,'' the statement added. `` The Naval Security and Investigative Command, in coordination with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, is conducting a routine investigation of the matter. Because the matter is under investigation, and no individuals have been charged with any wrong-doing, it would be premature to release any details at this time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> forbid fraternization between security guards and local women at posts in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries and several other nations, including communist <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources, the alleged fraternization among guards in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> included sexual intercourse during several contacts that occurred late last year and early this year. The sources, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified, said the allegations came to light in February when two <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> women sought asylum at the Canadian embassy, claiming they feared arrest for consorting with foreigners. The women had with them the names of some Marine guards, the officials said. Assuming no evidence of espionage is developed, the sources said the four Marines would probably face only administrative disciplinary action and not courts-martial. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, the guard force in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for the interests section includes one detachment commander and seven watchstanders.

<HEAD>House Gives Approval to $44.1 Billion Farm Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 44.1 billion money bill for farm programs and food aid Thursday with fewer complaints this year from urban lawmakers that payment programs have gotten out of hand. `` Everyone's pointing to agriculture like we're the ones who are causing the deficit, like we're all causing all this international debt,'' <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. He said agriculture represented only a small part of the estimated $ 176 billion budget deficit for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. `` They stumble over that much at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat said. Farm payment programs, which include price supports, income supports and conservation payments, peaked at $ 26 billion in 1986. Those programs now are down to an estimated $ 17 billion in fiscal 1988. The drop in overall farm payments has muted somewhat the chorus of complaints that met 1985 legislation designed to alleviate painful problems in the farm economy. But while farm payments have gone down as the farm economy has recovered, a number of critics of `` excesses'' in the farm programs say there still is much to complain about. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 343-54 to approve the money bill amid calls from farm-bloc lawmakers for aid to growers and livestock producers squeezed financially by a drought across broad areas of the country. The bill earmarked no drought aid, however, and most lawmakers said they were inclined to go along with administration suggestions that it would be best to wait until the full extent of the problem becomes clear. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been saying an inch or so of rain once a week for the rest of the growing season would rescue <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> corn and soybeans, although wheat in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> is in far worse condition. The bill calls for outlays of $ 44.1 billion for the fiscal 1989 for programs ranging from farm payments to food stamps. That is $ 2.5 billion less than requested by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and $ 12 billion below last year's amount. It also is $ 3 billion below an agricultural appropriations bill currently being drawn up in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. It contains $ 16.3 billion for food and nutrition programs, $ 12.4 billion for rural development and $ 6.8 billion to replace losses of the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates federal payment programs for farmers. Farm program spending has dropped sharply over the last year as exports expanded and the farm economy shook off the doldrums of the early 1980s. Thus a $ 14.3 billion decrease in funds to cover losses of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> represents the bill's major savings. Critics, however, said it is optimistic to expect a sale of government-held stocks will yield $ 3 billion to help cover additional losses and hold down costs. `` It appears to me there are lots of mirrors on the ceiling and lots of smoke coming from the cloakroom,'' Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa., said Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, R-Wis., said it most likely would be necessary to come back for a supplemental appropriation later The House debated for two hours a plan by Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, to bar further <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> loans to farmers already in default. But farm forces defeated, 310-88, a parliamentary maneuver designed to bring up his proposal for a vote. `` Everybody knows that you do n't lend money to people who never paid you back on you're previous loans,'' <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON> said. `` Everybody but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Farm state lawmakers were quick to take up <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>'s challenge. `` This gentleman who comes here from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and suggests that the farmers are trying to pull the wool over the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> just has n't been there to share the problems,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, D-Ill. The Targeted Export Assistance program, established in 1985 as a subsidy for overseas advertising and promotion of food exports exports, came under renewed criticism from Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` Even if the program were extremely well run, maybe we ought not to be funding it,'' he said. He pointed to millions of dollars paid out to private companies for advertising campaigns abroad. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> cited a report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> that found program mismanagement.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is sending volunteers to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for the first time in 21 years and will begin a new program in the <LOCATION> Comoros </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, agency director <PERSON> Loret </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON> said Thursday. A <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> assessment team will also go to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this summer, to plan for the first set of volunteers for that country, Mrs. <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON> told a luncheon audience at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. The three new programs will bring to nearly 70 the number of countries welcoming the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, and Mrs. <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON> said the grass-roots agency hopes to grow even bigger. `` Those cynics who wonder if the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is still around should know that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president have not only endorsed, but mandated, a five-year growth plan for the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to double in size to 10,000 volunteers by 1992,'' she said. The agency, whose last program in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> ended in 1967, is sending eight volunteers to <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION> this fall to train high school teachers. The emphasis will be on training English teachers, but education courses for biology, chemistry and physics instructors also will be given. Nine volunteers will be assigned to the <LOCATION> Comoros </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, an Islamic nation 250 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. They will arrive in July for language and cultural training and begin working in September, Mrs. <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> program is scheduled to begin sometime next year. Since Chinese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON>'s announcement in March that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would welcome the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, the agency has received 300 public queries from Americans declaring their eagerness to participate in the Chinese program, said agency spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON>. `` That's a fairly good number of people expressing an interest in going to a particular country,'' <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON> said. The Peace Corps never guarantees a volunteer's choice of country, but <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON> said the agency was bouyed by the interest shown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. At the time of Wu's announcement, officials said an English-teaching program would be the most likely plan and that the initial complement would be about 50 volunteers. The assessment team will discuss the location of the first group. `` It's very much their call,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON> said of the Chinese. The Peace Corps was created during the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> administration to spread skills to the grass roots of developing countries and broaden the horizons of young Americans. Despite conservative hostility to the agency at the outset of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, it has grown in the past seven years. The <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> gets 200,000 queries a year from potential volunteers, of whom 17,000 fill out applications and 2,600 are accepted. Currently, the agency is particularly interested in people with skills as teacher trainers and agriculture experts, Mrs. <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON> said. In its expansion plans, the agency will try to increase the size of some of its contingents and try to get more nations to accept volunteers. During its heyday, the agency's biggest program was in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where up to 1,600 volunteers served. The biggest one is now in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where there are 300 Peace Corps people. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> would be a fertile ground for new programs, Mrs. <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON> said. On that continent, only <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> accept volunteers, she said.

 Business inventories rose moderately as sales slackened in April, the government said Thursday in a report signaling slower economic growth for the second quarter. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said inventories climbed 0.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 723.7 billion in April. The gain came as total business sales fell 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 478.8 billion. The rise in goods stockpiled on shelves and backlots followed a 0.3 percent climb in March and a 0.4 percent increase in February. The slight drop in business sales came after a 1.9 percent jump in March, the largest in more than a year, and a 1.1 percent gain in February. Economists generally take rising inventories as a sign that buying demand is slowing and as an indication that manufacturers may have to cut back production. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic forecasting service in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said April inventory growth was `` slightly disturbing'' and would be `` a real source of concern'' if it continued. But he said he expected smaller growth in the months ahead and did not foresee a return to the high rate of inventory expansion from October to January, when monthly increases ranged from 0.7 percent to 1.2 percent. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a goverment securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said slower growth in the economy as a whole, as measured by the gross national product, may be a `` blessing in disguise.'' `` The inventory numbers certainly signal the likelihood we'll grow at a slower pace Maybe GNP will hit 2.5 percent in the second quarter, compared with 3.9 percent in the first quarter,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` But that may be desireable because it could well make it possible to maintain more sustained growth without a sharp acceleration of inflationary pressure,'' he said. Inventories in April were 7.9 percent higher than a year ago, while sales were 7.6 percent greater. The rise in April inventories included a 0.9 percent increase at the wholesale level, a 0.4 percent rise in goods held by manufacturers and a 0.3 percent growth at the retail level. The 0.2 percent decline in business sales was paced by 0.4 percent drops in both wholesale and retail sales. Sales by manufacturers were unchanged. In an advance report on Wednesday, the government said retail sales edged up only 0.1 percent in May. The combination of falling sales and moderately rising inventories pushed the inventory-to-sales ratio up from 1.50 in March to 1.51 in April. That means it would take 1.51 months to exhaust inventories at the April sales pace, a ratio not considered abnormally high.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, recovering from an accident in January, has successfully resumed its testing of a chemical laser that one day could become a key part of any Star Wars anti-missile defense system, officials said Thursday. The latest test of the so-called Alpha laser was conducted Wednesday night behind closed doors at a contractor's laboratory in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capistrano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. It marked the final check-out of all the laser components and support equipment and was considered a complete success, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weapons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Kirtland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, N.M. The test replicated all the heat and pressure effects that will exist when a laser beam is produced in the new system, but by design no `` lasing'' was attempted on Wednesday, said <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. The next and final stage of the testing program _ producing a high-powered laser beam through a chemical reaction _ will probably begin this fall, the spokesman added. The test conducted Wednesday evening had been scheduled several months ago but was put off indefinitely while engineers repaired damage caused during a brief, accidental fire on Jan. 7. The fire at the <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> laboratory resulted from an operating mistake by a worker. Little direct damage was done, but the fire left contaminated the main vacuum chamber needed to simulate firing the laser in outer space, and thus halted all testing. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Weapons Laboratory completed a milestone test of its Alpha laser on Wednesday,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The laser successfully completed a hot flow test with heat released from the cavity. This test verified that all supporting assemblies were operating properly and that <PERSON> Alpha </PERSON> was ready to begin receiving the optical components necessary for full lasing tests.'' The experiment `` was as close as we can get to lasing without actually doing it,'' the spokesman added. The Alpha laser, described by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> as `` the most mature of the -LRB- Star Wars -RRB- directed-energy technologies,'' has been under study for almost a decade. The device is constructed primarily of aluminum, making it relatively light and compact, and draws its energy from the combustion of the gases hydrogen and fluorine. It is thought to generate roughly 2 million watts of power. Last October, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> awarded a contract to <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, asking it to assess the possibility of conducting experiments in space with Alpha. In the meantime, however, <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> _ which built the device _ began preparing for the first ground tests in the laboratory.

 Eight inmates, three of them convicted murderers, escaped Thursday from the only maximum-security penitentiary in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, and authorities say they likely split up after they fled. At least nine other inmates also tried but failed to flee the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> after several small fires were started in another section of the building to divert guards, said prison spokesman <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>. The escapees apparently sawed their sliding cell doors from their tracks and then cut through a prison window early Thursday morning, officials said. One prisoner was found hanging from the window, he said, and eight other single-man cells had cut marks on them, indicating those prisoners also tried to get out, said <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Banister </PERSON>, another spokesman, said the search was concentrated in the area around the penitentiary, which is five miles east of <LOCATION> Eddyville </LOCATION>. Authorities said dogs had tracked the scent of at least one escapee to a spot about a half-mile away where a pickup was stolen. `` We have reason to believe that based on various reports, they may have split up,'' <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said. The prison, near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barkley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, is surrounded on three sides by water and on the fourth by woods, <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said. `` It's very easy for an individual to elude us,'' he said. <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said officials believed the escape was the state's largest The fires broke out in the administrative control unit, which houses `` the worst of the worst,'' said <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>. The escapees were in another area, he said. State police dispatched two light airplanes to help in the search, along with troopers, the dog team, local authorities and 60 prison officers. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, a $ 5,000 reward was offered Thursday by authorities for information leading to the arrest of any of the four prisoners who escaped Sunday night from the <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>. `` The search for the missing four men is still at an intense level,'' said Sheriff <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedsole </PERSON>. `` We are not going to let up until they are back in the jail.''

 Taking a rare active role in an ongoing federal investigation, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told top law enforcement officials Thursday to move `` as rapidly as possible'' to get the facts in a burgeoning Pentagon fraud investigation. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> two years ago that he did not want lawmakers `` scrutinizing every paper clip, bolt and bullet'' in the defense budget, was described by spokesman <PERSON> Marlim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> as `` very concerned'' about allegations of bribe-paying and kickbacks. `` I think we're all aware of the wide scope of this investigation,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` and it certainly poses an internal security problem and an abuse problem of dimensions that have to be dealt with forthrightly.'' `` I'm just not at liberty to expand on any of the details,'' he said when asked to elaborate. Federal investigators armed with evidence from two years' worth of wiretaps and this week's coast-to-coast raids are preparing to approach witnesses who now may be forced to cooperate in the probe. The investigation has turned up `` rampant bribery in the government'' and includes allegations of cash payments, purchase of cars and payments of bills for government employees, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the ranking <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> believes this is a matter `` that deserves his attention, and that everyone involved should know of his feelings, the intensity which he feels about dealing with any kinds of crimes that have been committed here.'' Government sources familiar with the probe said searches of offices of 15 defense contractors on Tuesday stemmed from wiretaps on the offices of two top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials. The bugs have been in place for much of the two-year investigation. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1985 created a commission to study ways to streamline <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> operations. The panel, headed by industrialist and former Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>, recommended a stronger hand for the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> and a new civilian office to oversee <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> purchasing. The commission also recommended that there be less `` micromanagement'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he agreed with that. `` Instead of scrutinizing every paper clip, bolt and bullet, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should give more thought to our overall defense needs and strategy,'' he said. On Thursday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> and top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> prosecutors. He had met Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seldom has involved himself directly in investigations of alleged wrongdoing, although he was interviewed by a commission that probed the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president had not been told about the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> investigation at its outset, but was not disturbed by that. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> starts hundreds of investigations that are carried out over a long period of time. The White House is not aware of most, if not all of, those investigations,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` there always comes a time when any investigation, when it's presented to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for criminal action or whether it's presented to a grand jury for possible indictment, it becomes known to the civilian authority, whether it's the president or the head of the agency or the bureau or whatever. `` I'm sure that in this case, it was simply their judgment that this was the right time to make it known to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president was `` satisfied that the bureau has acted with the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quickly and effectively and pursued this investigation.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Propose Tightening OSHA Regulations In Wake Of Apartment

 Lawmakers who say the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> has taken little action to prevent construction accidents such as last year's collapse of a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> apartment complex that killed 28 workers on Thursday proposed tightening federal laws regulating construction. The legislation would stiffen <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> fines, tighten accident reporting requirements, mandate a professional engineer to oversee construction projects, make negligent employers liable to stiff prison terms and give the agency authority to shut down a work site to investigate an accident. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> lawmakers drafted the measure following <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings examining the April 23, 1987, collapse of <LOCATION> L'Ambiance </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>, a half-built apartment complex in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. L'Ambiance Plaza was the worst construction accident in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> history `` It has been more than a year since <PERSON> L'Ambiance </PERSON> collapsed,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., the chief <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spnosor `` Tragically, we have seen little movement to change any of the factors that contributed to the accident.'' <PERSON> Shays </PERSON> said he hoped the bill would `` arm <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> with the proper tools to help fulfill its mandate to protect worker health and safety.'' Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., the chief sponsor in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said the country `` must not tolerate any more <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> or L'Ambiance Plazas or any of the thousands of other accidents that claim lives and futures and could be avoided if industry and government act swiftly and responsibly. L'Ambiance Plaza was the nation's worst construction accident since a cooling tower under construction in <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, collapsed in 1978, killing 51. The Shays-Weicker bill: _ Requires an onsite engineer or architect to oversee construction projects. _ Increases maximum <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> construction fines from $ 10,000 per violation to $ 25,000. _ Increases maximum criminal penalties for first-time `` willful violations'' from six months in prison and $ 10,000 in fines to 10 years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines. Repeat offenders would be subject to 20 years in prison and $ 500,000 in fines. _ Gives <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> officials the authority to close down a work site to investigate an accident. _ Mandates employers to report accidents and for <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> officials to inspect within 24 hours when there are at least three workers hospitalized, one `` life-threatening'' injury or fatality or a collapse, partial collapse or near collapse of a building. Under current <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> regulations, contractors are required to report an accident only if a worker is killed or at least five are seriously injured, and there is no mandate for <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> inspections.

<HEAD>Task Force: Make Careful Vice Presidential Choices</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Presidential candidates should thoroughly evaluate their running mates and not make hasty decisions for the occupant of the office a heartbeak away from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, political experts said Thursday. `` The speed with which vice presidential candidates are selected can still create serious problems,'' according to a report prepared by a task force that included former top aides to Presidents <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. The report, commissioned by the 20th Century Fund, a non-profit research organization, said the position of vice president, long the butt of jokes, is critical because it is so close to the Oval Office. To ensure the best person gets the nod, presidential candidates could use a mix of tools: questionnaires, interviews, polls and informal inquiries. In the end, however, politics plays a big role in the selection. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, respectively the expected 1988 Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, have not revealed their choice of running mate, but the issue is attracting widespread attention. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, a former aide to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, recalled that Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., was a compromise vice presidential candidate in 1976 Although <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> maintains <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was an asset, others viewed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as `` not a good candidate.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> lost the election to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` All too often you end up making the decision at 2 a.m.,'' <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Heclo </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, criticized the selection process. He said vice presidential candidates <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> in 1964; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> in 1972; <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> in 1968 and <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> in 1984 were not `` shining successes of finding what the Founding Fathers used to call the continental character.'' <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>, the only one of those candidates elected, was forced out of office in a corruption scandal. On balance, the experts said the vice presidency is a healthy if imperfect institution in which the incumbent can play a role advising the president on a range of issues and representing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abroad. But <PERSON> Helco </PERSON> and two other panel members, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s former aide, and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuss </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, suggested the vice presidency does more harm than good and should be abolished. `` All you are trying to do is create some stand-by equipment,'' said <PERSON> Heclo </PERSON>, who argued that a special election could be held to choose a successor to a disabled president. <PERSON> Reuss </PERSON> criticized the `` imperial nature'' of the vice presidency, which comes with a mansion, a seal and its own aircraft, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two. The vice president also has a large staff. `` The modern vice presidency that has developed with little forethought over the past 30 years is proving a more disruptive than constructive feature of our political system,'' the dissenters said.

 An assailant shot and wounded an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier here Thursday, and troops rounded up dozens of Arabs for questioning. One witness said suspects were forced to stand on one foot under the hot sun. The army clamped a curfew on <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city. It was the second shooting of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier since the Arab uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began Dec. 8. In a crackdown on the recent wave of firebomb attacks on Israeli targets, troops demolished seven houses of Arab suspects and sealed five other homes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Soldiers have been ordered to shoot at firebomb throwers with the intent to injure and to demolish the homes of suspects. Elsewhere in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, dozens of Jewish settlers, some wearing prayer shawls, blocked a major highway for two hours to demand harsh army action against <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> firebombers. The army said the reserve soldier was traveling in his own car when he was hit by a bullet. A spokesman declined to say if the soldier was in uniform. The wounded soldier was taken by helicopter to a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> hospital and the shooting was being investigated, the spokesman said. He said the soldier was slightly injured, but refused to elaborate or identify him. The other <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier shot during the uprising, Sgt. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, 28, died of a head wound received in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> on March 20. Troops conducted a search for suspects and the weapon, sealing off <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and prohibiting all drivers except <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> settlers who live nearby from entering or leaving the city. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> is 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Four hours after the shooting, about 60 cars were lined up outside <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and an equal number were lined up inside the city waiting to pass a roadblock manned by three jeeploads of troops. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> vehicle, a car belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and an Arab ambulance were turned back. Arab witnesses said troops rounded up dozens of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, confiscated their identity cards and fired shots in the air. `` It seems the army is very angry because this is the first time I've seen them this strict. They are shooting in the air like crazy,'' said <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Islam </PERSON> <PERSON> Deedi </PERSON>, an Arab reporter who lives in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, said troops detained about 50 suspects and lined them up against walls. During questioning under the hot summer sun, the Arabs were made to stand on one leg with their arms outstretched, said <PERSON> Deedi </PERSON>, who said he watched the roundup from a window in his home. <PERSON> Deedi </PERSON> said troops also wired off streets where the shooting occurred and erected about 10 roadblocks in the city center where they stopped and searched Palestinian cars. He said several busloads of troops patrolled the streets. According to army figures, 346 soldiers have been injured since the uprising began, most of them by stones. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> puts the Palestinian death toll at 208. Two Israelis also have been killed. Underground leaders of the uprising ordered Palestinians to observe Thursday as a day for stockpiling food, first aid supplies and gasoline to prolong their resistance to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation. Arabs from a bus stalled at the roadblock descended and began throwing rocks at the settlers, who responded by hurling them back, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and a Jewish settler said. The army fired in the air to disperse the stone-throwers, then dismantled the roadblock. About 60 Jewish settlers from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of <LOCATION> Efrat </LOCATION>, meanwhile, used their cars to block the major Jerusalem-Hebron highway used by thousands of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers to get to their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The settlers said in a statement the action was to protest an increase in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> firebomb attacks. The army responded to the stepped up attacks by orders this week to shoot firebombers. Also Thursday, a 17-year-old Palestinian prostitute was charged in a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> district court with the shooting death of a Jewish seminary student earlier this month. The charge sheet alleges nationalistic motives. A military court sentenced four Palestinians convicted of throwing firebombs. Three were sentenced to 10 years in prison for hurling a homemade gasoline bomb at a civilian car Jan. 31 in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The fourth was given eight years for throwing a firebomb at a military jeep in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on Feb. 26.

 The son of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> was sentenced Thursday to four months in jail for selling $ 25 worth of cocaine to an undercover police officer. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 24, also was ordered to pay a $ 1,500 fine and perform 300 hours of community service. `` We are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the sentence,'' <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said, noting that other defendants in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> drug cases have received lighter penalties. She said the conviction would be appealled. During his sentencing hearing, <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> in a shaky voice that he has sworn off drugs. `` I'd like to make a personal pledge to you and my family that I will never again be involved in drugs or any illegality,'' he said. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON>, asked <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> to accept a probation officer's recommendation of a suspended sentence, probation and community service. But <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> told <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, `` I ca n't in good conscience sentence you without any time to serve.'' <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> faced a maximum of five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said he was pleased with the sentence. He denied treating the case differently. `` This was a case in which we caught someone red-handed, and I mean red-handed,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. `` I felt that it was important for the court to say it does n't matter who you are. If you commit a drug offense in the state of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, you'll be treated with great severity.'' <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> suggested the jail time be served through the <ORGANIZATION> Chittenden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> so that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> could participate in a special corrections program that allows him to be kept under house arrest. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> would have to be accepted into the program. During the sentencing, <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> stood stoically beside his father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, and his mother, who was <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s running mate on the Democratic ticket in 1984 <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was arrested in February 1986 and convicted by a <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury last April. He was arrested after selling one-quarter gram of cocaine to undercover agent <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> while he was attending <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Rutland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> testified that she went to <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s off-campus home, where <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> produced a tray of cocaine packets from underneath the living room sofa. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was arrested that night outside the restaurant where he worked. <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON> argued that police used <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> as bait to snare him during a college party weekend. The prosecution denied the charge. At the sentencing hearing, a tearful <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> had asked <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> not to treat her son differently than any other person convicted of selling $ 25 worth of cocaine. She also said <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s arrest and conviction have taken a heavy toll on her family and son. `` He does n't go to church with us,'' she said. `` He does n't want to be seen with us. It's not because he's ashamed of us. It's because he's ashamed of what he's done. Also testifying at the sentencing hearing was the Rev. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, the founder of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> shelter for runaways called <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> works as a volunteer. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> has learned his lesson. `` You ca n't try and reach these kids ... without coming into a far better and deeper understanding of your own value system,'' he said. `` Probably the most important things we learn are from our mistakes. <PERSON> John </PERSON> has learned them.'' <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> also received 30 letters written on behalf of <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, including one from his mother and one from <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. `` I saw him as a very fine young man who quickly became good friends with our children and who campaigned in a spirited and strong way around our nation,'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> wrote.

 A coalition of consumer groups on Thursday gave a producer of frozen yogurt, the manufacturer of <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> automobiles and eight other advertisers backhanded awards for presenting the most misleading commercials. The fourth annual Harlan Page Hubbard Memorial Awards, named for a 19th century advertising pioneer who promoted patent medicines as cures for virtually all ills, were announced at a ceremony that drew none of the winners. One prize went to Dannon frozen yogurt on a stick, for an ad showing a 6-year-old girl in a swimming suit. Critics charged that the image imposed a sexual message on little girls. `` We never imagined that consumers would take that message away,'' said <PERSON> Dannon </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, who said the ad is no longer running. It has been replaced by commercials stressing that the product is of interest to the whole family, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said the frozen yogurt ads ran for only a few weeks before being withdrawn. They were re-evaluated after consumers wrote in, she said. The Dannon commercials were chosen for a <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which said the ads encouraged the idea that females are mainly concerned with being attractive and sexually available. The awards consist of a statuette with a lemon on top, with the consumer group that nominated the ad actually collecting the trophy. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, however, said he's have been glad to send someone to get the award, if he had been informed in advance. `` When you get an award like this, you just have to laugh,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` ... It tells us our advertising is right on target and we will continue to pursue it with great vigor.'' <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> was selected for the <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> because of ads touting the safety of its cars. These were misleading, according to the Center for Auto Safety, because they were run at a time <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> was being investigated for problems with the sudden acceleration of its vehicles. An <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> court jury recently ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> was not at fault in at least one case of sudden acceleration. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was cited for ads boasting that it supplies maintenance services to other airlines. The Aviation Consumer Action Project said this was misleading because other carriers do maintenance for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> as well. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> respoded that `` the ad does n't make any claims that are not well founded. The Coalition on Smoking or Health cited the tobacco industry for ads that it said mislead consumers by suggesting that low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes may reduce health risks. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> replied that the consumer advocates overlooked the surgeon general's warnings printed on every cigarette ad. `` Those warnings make several billion impressions annually, and along with other anti-smoking information programs have certainly given consumers adequate information. I ca n't think of a single issue that people are more well informaed about than smoking and health,'' said <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Beef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was mentioned for its `` real food for real people'' ads promoting the consumption of red meat, which some nutritionists contend can raise cholesterol levels. `` The leading health organizations have issued dietary guidelines that include red meat as one of the essential ingredients,'' responded spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. He charged that the Center for Science in the Public Interest had distorted those findings in order to get more publicity. Contour Chair of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> was picked for a <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>. It contended that ads for the special recliner chairs do not detail health claims and it is hard for consumers to learn prices. The prices are not printed because they vary, since the chairs are custom made, said company sales representative <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Olin </PERSON>. And as for health claims, he said, `` All the statements that we made are verifiable.'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Aduss </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awareness </ORGANIZATION>, said his organization would have no response to its selection, although he did observe that it has been included in the list for several years. The council runs ads promoting nuclear energy and stressing that it is a viable alternative to dependence on oil and other sources. <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was cited for ads showing children playing with the G.I. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobra </PERSON> <PERSON> Momba </PERSON> toy helicopter. The toy is fragile, hard to handle and disappointing to children, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> contended. `` We respectfully disagree with their opinion,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Charness </PERSON>. Other advertising chosen for the awards included: _ <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, for its ads showing people with car trouble or other problems saved by having someone send them money In reality, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> asserted, the money wo n't come to you; you have to go to a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> office or pay a delivery charge. Even then, the payment is usually a check, not cash, it added. <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bechtel </PERSON> retorted that `` we've never suggested in ads that someone is going to deliver money to your house or office of something. The service is provided through 11,000 outlets nationally and almost always paid in cash, he said. _ Cutty Sark scotch whisky, for a television ad which the Center for Science in the Public Interest said should not have been run because of a policy by the television networks and the spirits industry not to advertise on TV The Spanish-language ad ran on a local TV station, the group said. `` We just dismiss this action as being typical of that group, who have a history of trying to discredit the wine and spirits industry,'' responded <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Buckingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which markets Cutty Sark in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Call them big, call them hefty _ hey, call'em huge _ but do n't say the Fat Boys, those high-calorie rappers, drink <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> beer. The three beefy bandmates charged in a federal lawsuit this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> intimated just that in one of its Lite commercials _ the one where an immense <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> `` Rapping Fats'' <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> raps that the `` less-filling'' brew `` tastes great.'' The suit says <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>'s obese appearance and rapping have left a bad taste in the <ORGANIZATION> Fat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>' mouths _ one that the comic, the beer company and its ad agency should pay $ 5 million to remove. `` In their efforts to promote the sale of alcohol, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> intentionally selected and exploited the likenesses and performing musical styles of the Fat Boys,'' the suit filed Monday charged. The portly plaintiffs are <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> -LRB- better known as `` Prince Markie Dee'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Damon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wimbley </PERSON> -LRB- aka `` Kool Rock Ski'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Darren </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Human Beat Box'' -RRB-, along with the group's record company and music publisher. They're asking for $ 5 million in damages and withdrawal of the commercial. They allege the ad, which features <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> rolling around on a huge bogus belly while rapping with three heavyweight partners, takes advantage of their platinum-selling record success and infringes on the Fat Boys trademark. That's right. The Fat Boys received Registration No. 1,351,054 from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Patent and <ORGANIZATION> Trademark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> for their name on July 23, 1985. `` The weight of the members _ their actual physical size _ combined with other elements of music, costume and performance style constitutes an identifiable and unique characteristic of the group,'' the lawsuit said. It also alleges the commercial's music, particularly the vocal percussion of one rotund performer behind <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>, `` contains a melody copied from -LRB- and -RRB- derived from'' the Fat Boys' music. A spokesman for the comedian, <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, had no immediate comment on the suit. The ad agency, <ORGANIZATION> Backer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Spielvogel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, declined comment; a <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> spokesman was not in the company's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> headquarters to react to the suit.

 A drought parching much of the country dropped water levels in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers, making the waterways unnavigable Thursday and meaning `` major-league'' losses for the inland shipping industry. A seven-mile stretch of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Mound </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, remained closed to all traffic while a dredge deepened a shallow channel. Dozens of towboats and barges were stranded. Meanwhile, nearly 700 barges in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> were tied up north and south of the <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, bridge because the river had dropped to the lowest levels since authorities began keeping records in 1872. `` Everybody is concerned,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkop </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The group comprises industry, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> officials who monitor river conditions. `` We've experienced tough river conditions and closures before, but nothing this bad,'' said <PERSON> Brinkop </PERSON>. He said the industry is losing `` major-league dollars'' because of the traffic stoppage. Towboat crews stranded on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers spent their time painting, watching television, doing light maintenance and even fishing while each towboat owner loses about $ 10,000 daily. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said a 300-foot stretch of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> had water levels of about eight feet _ the lowest mark there since January 1969. For safe passage, he said barges need at least 8.11 feet of water. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, closed the river. It was to reopen Thursday night, but underground cables and debris forced a delay until Friday afternoon. In the past two weeks, more than a dozen barges have gone aground near the <LOCATION> Mound </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area, said Guard spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Buri </PERSON>. The dredge <ORGANIZATION> Elco </ORGANIZATION> was summoned to dig a 2,100-foot channel 11 feet deep by 250 feet wide, he said. Low water in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> has created bottlenecks in places like <LOCATION> Vaucluse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Landing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, about three miles north of the <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, bridge. An <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> patrol </ORGANIZATION> boat has been escorting barges with light loads one-by-one, and prospects for ending the bottleneck north of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> brightened Thursday. Spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Logue </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> marked a previously unknown secondary channel at <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>. He said it appeared smaller towboats would be able to use it. `` Since we found the secondary channel, it looks like the small tows will be able to go ahead and pass,'' <PERSON> Logue </PERSON> said. `` The larger tows will have to wait.'' Authorities said it would take at least a day and possibly two to dredge a channel 16-feet to 20-feet deep that could handle larger barges. On board the stranded towboats, crews made the best of it. `` There's plenty of work, there's always something to do,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Southern </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, a first mate on the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. `` Some people are even trying to fish.'' Idle barges also worried shippers like <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Crafton </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, Ky. He depends on barges to deliver his petroleum products. `` Our last shipment was delayed about a day,'' he said. `` The river conditions concern me. Like everyone else, I'm hoping for some rainfall.''

 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> says it was in the stars that he should be honored as the 50 millionth person to ride the city's public transportation system. His horoscope predicted he had a chance to win a contest. `` Do you realize what the odds are _ 50 million to one?'' <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I should be so lucky when I play the lottery.''

 The former chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, convicted last year of giving an illegal gratuity to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, was indicted Thursday on tax fraud, conspiracy and other charges. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, 81; <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickran </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Beaumont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Farmingdale </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Zito </PERSON>, <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>'s daughter and secretary-treasurer of the company were charged in the indictment. <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> was described as a silent partner in the company. According to the indictment, the defendants paid more than $ 200,000 in bribes and kickbacks to insure that <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> received profitable printing contracts. The defendants laundered more than $ 250,000 in cash through a phony invoice scam to attain cash for the bribes and personal use, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said at a news conference. The charges cover seven years from 1971 through February. They are an offshoot of the investigation that led to <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>'s conviction last September for giving an illegal gratuity to <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and interstate travel charges `` While I am sympathetic to his age and frailties, there is no way to leave him out of these charges while he is still in this life,'' <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattem </PERSON> said <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> attended meetings where money laundering was discussed, mediated disputes and `` divided up the booty.'' In the previous case, <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, a powerful party boss from 1969 until his retirement in 1984, was found guilty of paying for two vacations taken by <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, a 10-term <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s girlfriend. In return, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> used his influence to lobby city and federal officials on behalf of financially ailing <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the second-largest client of <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>'s insurance company, <ORGANIZATION> Serres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. Wiretaps played in open court showed the trips were actually paid by <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, 69, was convicted of illegally accepting gratuities but was cleared of more serious bribery and conspiracy charges. Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> to a suspended two-year prison term and fined him $ 500,000, citing <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>'s frail health He and <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, who is currently on trial in federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> racketeering and bribery case, are appealing the convictions. In the <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> case, each defendant is charged with six counts of violating interstate travel laws to commit bribery, five counts of making false statements on <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>'s tax returns and one count of conspiracy to make false statements on tax returns. <PERSON> Dickran </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Zito </PERSON> were additionally charged with three counts of making false statements on their personal income tax returns. If convicted, the defendants face up to five years in prison on the interstate travel and conspiracy charges and three years on the tax charges.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government employed convicted Nazi war criminal <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON> as an intelligence agent for 10 years after World War II to help fight communism in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged Thursday. A report released by Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON> worked with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Counter-Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> CIC </ORGANIZATION>, and that officials accepted two different versions he gave of his background. The 92-page report said <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON>, now 77 and living in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, `` manipulated the <ORGANIZATION> CIC </ORGANIZATION> into protecting him from being brought to justice for his crimes.'' <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON> was convicted in absentia and sentenced to death in his native <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> in 1947 for being primarily responsible for killing 101 people in an operation in which Belgians identified with the resistance were `` arbitrarily selected to be arrested, beaten, tortured, imprisoned, deported or murdered.'' An Austrian jury in 1965 found him guilty of two wartime murders but acquitted him on the basis that he was following order. The decision was overturned by the <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but the case has not been retried. <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON> also was accused of torturing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airmen. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted a two-year study at the request of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON> accomplished his deception because of the <ORGANIZATION> CIC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` practice of utilizing Nazi criminals and their collaborators in its postwar, Cold War European intelligence operations.'' <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON> served with the <ORGANIZATION> CIC </ORGANIZATION> from 1946 until December 1956 and later worked for the Austrian State Police. He became an Austrian citizen in 1959. <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said at a news conference that the report has been given to the Belgian and Austrian governments. The report said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> intelligence group discovered <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON>'s true identity when the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> asked information about him. <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> declined to say how long the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had known who he was or to give any other information about the agency's involvement with <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said there were obvious dangers in using Nazi war criminals because they might be blackmailed. In <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON>'s case, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> did n't even know who they had hired, he said. <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said the investigation was not related to any modern intelligence-gathering efforts and was not meant to be judgmental. But he said some conclusions `` cry out.'' The report said the <ORGANIZATION> CIC </ORGANIZATION> followed a policy that `` the end justifies the means.'' The report described 13 other past <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents and informants with Nazi connections but did not name them. <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, in cooperating with the investigation, had demanded that they not be identified. He said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigators interviewed <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON> himself in the summer of 1985 and found him unrepentent. `` He thinks he has nothing to be ashamed of,'' <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division, said the investigation was done as thoroughly as possible, `` regardless of who that will embarrass or make uncomfortable.'' The report said no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government agency made any effort to apprise Belgian authorities of <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON>'s whereabouts when his true identity was uncovered. It said that even when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agency dismissed <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON>, after it discovered his <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war record in 1956, it did so `` without prejudice'' and classified him as `` suitable for intelligence re-employment.'' The report said the <ORGANIZATION> CIC </ORGANIZATION> apparently relied entirely on the information <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON> gave about himself, including the name he gave, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>. In 1950, he informed the agency his name was really <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON>, describing himself as a devoted <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member since the mid-1930s and a member of a <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> security unit that was declared a criminal organization after the war, the report said. `` Despite this change in identity and life history, the -LRB- CIC -RRB- made no attempt to verify the information <PERSON> Verbelen </PERSON> supplied about himself, and it continued to employ him,'' the report said.

 Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made a pitch to a roomful of senators Thursday to `` be fair'' in delegate selection, but afterward his total remained at one senator supporting him for president. Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, said that as a `` super delegate'' he will vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at the Democratic convention this summer because <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won his state. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> deserves his vote, he said, even thouigh <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` the obvious winner'' of the presidential contest. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, who made an unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1984, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign this year is far different from four years ago. `` This time he's run a winning campaign. He has n't frightened anyone. He's charmed them in all of those different debates and in his own right has leveled off, and really, you're looking at <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> not as a black but really for his own philosophy with respect to hunger and nutrition and jobs and drugs and everything else,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said. Although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is certain to get the nomination, said <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, `` for the good of the party, we also ought to be supporting Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' None of the others among 33 Democrats who met at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s request in the Capitol jumped to join <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> in backing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, although they listened with interest to the candidate's appeal for support, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Delmarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made a case, according to those present, that he should get the convention votes of `` super delegates'' in whose states and districts he won the popular vote. Super delegates are Democrats who will have votes at the convention by virtue of their elected or party leadership positions. Later <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters that the Democratic leadership, `` while accepting my investment in the party to make it strong, has not been as reciprocal as it ought to be.'' `` The people have spoken and now leadership should catch up with the people,'' he said. `` If in fact I have injected nothing in the party, I should expect no return. If I invest I should reasonably expect return,'' he told reporters. `` So I appreciate the accolades that I am the voter registration champion for the party, that I have led the drive to return the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> back to the Democrats, that I have won states that no one said I could win.'' However, he added, `` If I have done all of that, I simply say let's be fair.'' He was praised earlier Thursday by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, before whom he testified on drug abuse prevention and treatment. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has made the drug issue a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, told the committee that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces should not be used as the primary interdiction force, but rather should be used for backing up other agencies and providing intelligence. `` We must be careful, however, to avoid involving the military in any police actions agianst citizens or arrests,'' he said. `` We should not lead with our military forces in drugs or any other aspect of foreign policy.'' <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and the other senators thanked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for his years as an outspoken leader against drugs and for his work with young people Later <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at a rally outside the Capitol denouncing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a terrorist state. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urged support for anti-apartheid legislation.

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> farmers burned the thorns off cactus to provide emergency cattle feed in a drought called the worst in a half-century, while growers in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> bemoaned Thursday's scattered showers as little more than tantalizing. `` It's going to help a few farmers, but for most farmers it's too little too late,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, a meteorologist for <ORGANIZATION> WeatherData </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, after some <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> communities got more than 2 inches of rain and <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, got 1 -LCB- inches Thursday morning Drought has plagued the nation's midsection, where it's as dry as it's been since the Dust Bowl, and the Southeast, forcing farmers to sell off cattle they ca n't afford to feed and to plow under shriveled crops. The June shortfall of rainfollows a dry winter and a parched spring. Thursday's showers, said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, were `` just enough to settle the dust. But it's keeping the sun from shining and baking things. That's one consolation.'' Another consolation was an additional $ 10 million in emergency state loans for up to 45,000 Hoosier farmers. Elsewhere, barges along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> were stranded at low-water bottlenecks, fires were on the rise in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and ginseng growers in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> were discovering that even they were suffering, although the exotic root thrives on arid soil. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointed an interagency committee to deal with the widespread drought. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ranchers in the Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> are using propane burners to remove thorns from prickly pear cactus to allow cattle to graze on the water-retaining plants, said <PERSON> Kraig </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallimore </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s farmer assistance program. However, the drought has struck so deep in some areas that ranchers have stopped the practice because even cactus is shriveling, he said. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said was hit hardest, an agricultural economist predicted losses from three major crops could total $ 2.7 billion this year. The estimate accounts for losses in federal deficiency payments and turnover of the money in the economy, but not `` for the losses we'll likely have on crops other than wheat, barley and oats,'' said <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leholm </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> climatologist, said the state normally gets 3-4 inches of rain in June and this year has only received 0.3 inches so far for the month. `` It's worse than'76. I think it goes back to'34,'' said <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, who blamed the drought on a large high-pressure ridge that is diverting low-pressure storm systems north into <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Because the system covers most of the nation's midsection, it's likely to persist for some time, he said. <PERSON> Firmin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rettinghauf </PERSON>, 72, whose three sons farm his land near <LOCATION> Gilbertville </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, walked through his parched fields and proclaimed: `` There ai n't gon na be no crops. It's the worst I've seen since'36.'' In southwest <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, cattle farmers continued selling off herds as pastures baked in the sun and feed prices skyrocketed. `` The man in the cow business is having to sell his factory, is what it amounts to,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Lamoni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> barn is reporting cattle sales 50 percent higher than a year ago. `` I'd rather take a beating than talk to a man about selling his herd.'' Two convenience store owners in <LOCATION> Walford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, decided that if farmers were going to take a loss, they would, too. The owners said their sign advertising `` Ice cream cones, 25 cents, until it rains'' will stay up until the area gets a drenching. Cones normally sell for 40 cents. Dropping water levels in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers made the waterways unnavigable Thursday, hurting the inland shipping industry. A seven-mile stretch of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Mound </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, remained closed to all traffic while a dredge deepened a shallow channel. Dozens of towboats and barges were stranded. Meanwhile, nearly 700 barges in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> were tied up north and south of the <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, bridge because the river had dropped to the lowest levels since authorities began keeping records in 1872. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> reported an increase in forest fires due to abnormally dry conditions. Hundreds of fires have broken out in the parched Ozark hills in recent months, and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> officials say it is the worst fire year since the 1940s for the <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Twain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. The forest has seen 260 fires blacken 13,600 acres so far this year, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Rolla </LOCATION>. In an average year, 5,000 to 6,000 acres are burned, he said. More than 3,200 acres of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> forest land have been damaged so far in June, exceeding a five-year average for the entire month, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, a member of the fire control staff at <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> ginseng growers, normally plagued by excess moisture, said even they were thinking about irrigation. `` It's good news to be dry but it's no good to be a desert,'' said <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON>, 51, who grows about 10 acres of the medicinal root near <LOCATION> Wausau </LOCATION>. `` We like it much drier than the regular farmers who grow corn or soybeans, but even for us it's going too long.''

<HEAD>Southern Baptists Charge Moral Erosion, Condemn Homosexuality</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Southern Baptists charged modern society with an `` erosion of moral sanity'' Thursday and condemned homosexuality as `` an abomination in the eyes of God.'' `` This deviant behavior has wrought havoc in the lives of millions,'' said assembled `` messengers'' of the 14.7 million-member denomination. On the last day of the convention, it adopted one of the most unqualified denunciations of homosexuality in recent major church annals. `` The Bible is very clear in its teaching that homosexuality is a manifestation of a depraved nature,'' the convention said, adding: `` Homosexuality is a perversion of divine standards and a violation of nature and of natural affections.'' The resolution said, `` Homosexuals are justified and even glorified in our secular media.'' With fundamentalists prevailing over moderates in this factionally divided gathering of 35,600 people, the meeting also whipped through a score of other resolutions. Among them, the convention: _ Voiced `` outrage over the firing of a competent, highly professional Christian,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Shere </PERSON>, as publisher of the <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> -RRB- Daily News By <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> for refusing to carry gay and lesbian advertising. _ Rejected an amendment that would have pledged the denomination's institutions not to fire or replace anyone for disagreeing with its policies, such as those recently demanding biblical literalism. _ Condemned provision of birth control information and devices at public school clinics, saying it undermined parental authority, fomented promiscuity and abdicated moral responsibility of schools. _ Declared family and biblical values `` under constant attack from materialism, secular humanism, substance abuse and rebellion against authority.'' _ Questioned aspects of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restoration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Act </ORGANIZATION>, saying it should be modified to protect religious liberty, assuring exemption of institutions indirectly controlled by religion, as well as those directly religious. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> layman, urged the resolution criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> newspaper publisher's firing, and for consistency also pushed for adoption of a policy allowing dissent by the denomination's employees. Instead, he said, he had been `` outvoted, outhustled and outfoxed'' by fundamentalists and likened to a `` polecat'' with other moderates at a convention which declared laymen could n't disagree with elected leaders `` I for one do not believe it,'' he said. In the resolution on homosexuality, gay people were termed the primary cause for the spread of AIDS, saying it not only has affected them `` but also innocent victims.'' Homosexuals, `` like all sinners, can receive forgiveness and victory through personal faith in Jesus Christ,'' the resolution said, adding: `` -LRB- While -RRB- God loves the homosexual and offers salvation, homosexuality is not a normal life style and is an abomination in the eyes of God.''

 A Colombian woman whose 7-year-old daughter brought a lump of cocaine to school in her backpack this week was arrested on a federal warrant Thursday when she came to court to regain custody of her children. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> was arrested by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal when she appeared in Commissioner <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>'s court, where she sought the return of the girl and her 5-year-old son.

The no-bail warrant was issued Wednesday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauk </PERSON> after Ms. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> was found to be on probation in another case in which she tried to carry thousands of dollars out of the country without reporting it.

 The Communist Party chief in strongly nationalistic <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> was relieved of his job Thursday and replaced by the current <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vajno </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaelaes </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. It was not clear from the brief <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dispatch whether <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vayno </PERSON>'s departure came because of a fall from political favor. <PERSON> Vayno </PERSON>'s leaving marked the third change in republic-level party leaders in less than a month. On May 21, the party chiefs in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> were replaced as the simmering territorial dispute over the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region continued. <PERSON> Vayno </PERSON>, 65, had been party boss in the Soviet republic on the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> since July 1978. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said his departure was approved at a meeting Thursday of the Estonian party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Under <PERSON> Vayno </PERSON>'s guidance, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> became a testing ground for many of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reform policies. However, <PERSON> Vayno </PERSON>'s leadership came under strong criticism at an April meeting of Estonian writers, filmmakers and other cultural workers, who complained of ecological problems, corruption and the functionings of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s government. Estonian nationalism has been strong since the formerly independent Baltic land was forcibly incorporated into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940. This nationalism continued during <PERSON> Vayno </PERSON>'s tenure in the Switzerland-sized jurisdiction. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Vanjo </PERSON> was relieved `` in connection with a transfer under the jurisdiction'' of the Moscow-based <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the party's policy-making body. The Committee could assign him to a job in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> or elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. His replacement, <PERSON> Vaelaes </PERSON>, 57, served earlier as a secretary of the Estonian party. In a separate biographical note, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> indicated the choice of <LOCATION> Vaelaes </LOCATION> was not unanimous, saying he received `` the majority of the votes'' from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Such decisions are usually unanimous. <PERSON> Vaelaes </PERSON> began his political career in <LOCATION> Tartu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, where he was elected head of the city's <LOCATION> Komsomol </LOCATION> _ young Communist league _ after graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Tartu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. He went on to lead the party organization in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s capital, for 10 years, and then was elected a party secretary for the republic-wide party apparatus He joined the diplomatic corps in 1980, and served as Soviet ambassador to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Laws Preserving AIDS Confidentiality Limited, Professor Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Laws protecting confidentiality for AIDS patients are less effective than those aimed at preventing discrimination in areas such as jobs and housing, a law professor writes in a leading medical publication. When it comes to AIDS infection, legal protection of medical confidence is often an illusion, said Professor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. `` While some laws appear to require and provide secrecy of medical data, others compel disclosures,'' he wrote in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> He cited examples in non-AIDS cases in which courts have ruled that public policies favoring confidentiality must yield when it is necessary to prevent danger to others. `` The protection privilege ends where the public peril begins,'' he said, quoting a <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision concerning the appropriateness of warning a person believed to be in danger of attack from a mental health patient. In general, high legal principles exist to justify the breaking of some medical confidences, regardless of laws to preserve those confidences, <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> wrote. An example, he said, would be a spouse's right to know if her mate is infected with the AIDS virus, because the information pertains to a risk to her life, he wrote. If potential victims ca n't be identified, disclosing the names of people with AIDS-related conditions to health authorities might be legally justifiable even if it is n't specifically required by law, according to the article. Currently, all 50 states require that diagnoses of AIDS be reported to health authorities, he said. Some states require the names of people diagnosed with the disease be reported. A number of states mandate reporting of every laboratory test that indicates infection is present, <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> said. AIDS, a fatal and incurable viral illness, is believed to be passed mainly through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during birth. The disease has struck more than 64,000 people in this country since 1979 and killed more than 36,000 of them, according to the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Laboratory tests for AIDS infection do not indicate whether a person has the disease, but only if the virus that causes it has entered his system. It can be years between infection and the appearance of symptoms. <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> said that rather than beefing up laws protecting confidentiality, it makes more sense to reinforce laws prohibiting discrimination against people with AIDS, with related conditions or people suspected of being infected. He praised a proposal in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> aimed mainly at curbing discrimination in areas such as housing, employment, education, insurance and access to medical care. The measure, an amendment to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Act </ORGANIZATION>, does not omit guidelines to protect confidentiality, but couples them with anti-discrimination provisions, he wrote. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Graff </PERSON>, legal director for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, agreed. `` Our position has been is that it is important to have confidentiality and anti-discrimination laws working in tandem to protect individuals,'' he said by telephone Thursday. `` And we know that this works.''

<TEXT>
 First-degree murder trials are on hold until the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> can decide if the <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury is legal. Defense attorneys claim the jury has too many members, making it easier for prosecutors to win an indictment. The high court granted a stay in a murder trial scheduled to begin next week, causing the postponement of all trials in which the defendants were indicted. Chief Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said Wednesday the ruling means none of the 17 first-degree murder cases in <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> will be able to go to trial. But <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said the current grand jury will keep indicting people for first-degree murder, which carries a penalty of life in prison or death in the electric chair. The high court ruling came Tuesday in the case of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> man already convicted and sentenced to death in one slaying, and to go on trial Monday on a second first-degree murder charge. His attorneys, Assistant Public Defenders <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, argued the case should be postponed until the grand jury issue is resolved. They claim <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> laws require a maximum of 18 grand jurors be impaneled at one time. <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s grand jury has 23 members. They claim because it only takes 12 members to vote for an indictment, it is easier to get 12 of 23 jurors than 12 of 18. Prosecutors, however, claim the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> gives larger counties the right to impanel up to 23 jurors and their position was upheld by Chief Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Santora </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The public defenders appealed to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said it could be three months before the justices rule. If the high court rules that <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was incorrect, <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said a new grand jury can be impaneled and the defendants re-indicted. The only possibility of serious problems, he said, would be if the high court voided past convictions. The county has been using 23 grand jurors since 1970.

<HEAD>New Pay Plan Would Bar Legislators From Keeping Honoraria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior House Democrat on Thursday proposed a new congressional salary system that would prohibit lawmakers from keeping honoraria earned from making speeches and writing articles. Under the legislation, members would select their own salaries in a range from the current level of $ 89,500 up to as much as $ 135,000, the amount recommended by a presidential pay commission. The proposal by Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, came two days after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to reject a 4 percent cost-of-living increase for next year. `` In being shy about declaring our worth in an honest way, all we do is demean our office and reinforce the public misimpression about public service,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said in a statement. He said that while he defends the current system, which lets <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members accept up to $ 2,000 per speech up to an annual limit of 30 percent of their congressional salaries, `` we are well advised to guard against even the appearance of a conflict of interest.'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> is consistently one of the top honoraria-earners in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. His proposal would permit lawmakers to choose a salary up to the last amount recommended by the presidential commission. `` Those members with more responsibility or longer tenure would be free to make a statement of their worth to their constituents openly and honestly by signing in at the high end of the scale,'' he said. The current limit of $ 3,000 in business-related living expense tax deductions also would be lifted under <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s proposal, allowing members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to deduct as much as they could justify to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Little Leaguers Quitting After Parents Play Basebrawl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some Little Leaguers who just wanted to play ball are quitting after watching their parents brawl and their coaches threaten to sue each other. A smoldering dispute flared into a 20-minute brawl last week after a championship game, and police were called to break it up. `` It's just a bunch of mad parents acting like fools,'' said <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON>, who has three sons on one of the teams. <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> called the situation unbelievable and said her 12-year-old son <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> has decided to quit the league. `` It got to a point where he could n't even play anymore because the parents were fighting,'' Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` They were fighting with the coaches, the board members were fighting, every game we had they'd always come up with a different rule.'' No matter which side the parents take in the controversy, they agree the infighting is hurting the kids and tarnishing the league's reputation. Fighting erupted Thursday when the A's beat the <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> by a run to claim the championship. A's Coach <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION>' Coach <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> attacked his son after the game, grabbing him by the neck and shaking him. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said he got so angry he tackled <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>, and other parents jumped in. <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> indicated he was only trying to head off a fight between the kids. He said his son, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, and <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Dwane </PERSON>, were arguing, so he grabbed <PERSON> Dwane </PERSON> by the shirt. Then <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> pounced on him from behind, he said. Both coaches retained lawyers and are considering suits. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> and some other parents claim the league is not being run by <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> rules and was dominated by President <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> who made his own rules and changed them frequently. But <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> says the problem is <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> and parents supporting <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> maintain the problems began when <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> started coaching this year. `` Things were more touchy. Things were more on edge,'' said <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON>. He called <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> `` a very competitive type person. I believed we lost the joy toward the children, and I believe a lot of parents picked up on that.''

<HEAD>Pacific Islands Representatives Seek Federal Aid to Combat Drug
Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territories told a congressional panel Thursday that they have increasing drug problems, and need the additional federal aid included in pending legislation. The bill, introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, would provide training, equipment and money for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mariana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugo </PERSON>, who presided at the hearing as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on insular and international affairs, said he expected the legislation to become part of a planned comprehensive drug bill this year. The legislation would provide $ 11.5 million in assistance in the first year, and $ 5.5 million annually in subsequent years. Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> said his territory has become a major transit point for drugs moving from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. But the governor and <PERSON> Iver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stridiron </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> legislature, said significant amounts of the drugs remain in the territory and are causing a large increase in violent crimes. `` It really has our community under siege,'' <PERSON> Stridiron </PERSON> said. But he added that with additional resources, the island territory could become a model of combatting the drug problem in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territories. <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> said his major problem is resources, commenting that the assignment of a single <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent in the islands indicates either `` non-recognition of a serious problem'' or lack of interest in solving it. Gov. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ada </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> said his territory is experiencing a resurgence of heroin abuse after cleaning up the problem following the Vietnam War. `` In 1985, there was not one single case of heroin possession in the territory of <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>,'' he testified. `` In 1986, 12 heroin arrests were made by our police department. `` In 1987, there were 108 cases of heroin possession, with 56 still pending laboratory analysis and confirmation. By any definition, this is an alarming rise,'' <PERSON> Ada </PERSON> said. The governor said 91 percent pure heroin from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> has been entering Guam through <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>. But after law enforcement officers discovered the route, the drugs began coming to <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> via the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marianas </LOCATION>, he said. Asked by <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugo </PERSON> if he could put a cost on <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>'s drug problem, <PERSON> Ada </PERSON> said the law enforcement price tag could be $ 2 million to $ 3 million, but added the real cost could only be measured in trauma and shattered lives _ not dollars. Responding to a question by Rep. <PERSON> Fofo </PERSON> I.F. <PERSON> Sunia </PERSON>, D-American <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ada </PERSON> said he would fire anyone in his administration abusing drugs with `` no questions asked.'' A written statement submitted by American <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> Gov. A.P. <PERSON> Lutali </PERSON> said the `` most pervasive and growing illegal substance abuse problem'' in his territory is marijuana, followed by cocaine. Referring to the marijuana problem, <PERSON> Lutali </PERSON>'s statement said, `` What 10 years ago was a situation involving a relatively small number of individuals importing the drug through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mail has now become a cultivation enterprises market by extended families producing in excess of seven tons per year.''

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not get dragged into `` bidding wars'' for the right to locate American military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> or anywhere else in the world. Asked by Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should get into `` bidding wars'' for such bases, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations that `` the concept of rent for bases we have to reject. When we have a base, it must because it is in the interests of both'' countries. Specifically, in the negotiations for extending the leases on the <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> air base and <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> naval base, `` there are those in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> who think it is a great asset and they would rent it out at a staggering sum of money,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` We've told them we reject that and will go elsewhere. We will stick to our position, and if we have to find other places for our ships and planes, we'll do it,'' he added. Negotiations are under way between the two countries to renew the five-year base leases that expire in 1991. Some Filipino officials have suggested the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pay more than $ 1 billion a year over the current $ 180 million attached to annual aid for the two bases. Regarding a law under consideration by the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> that would ban <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said `` nuclear deterrence is an esential ingredient in keeping the peace.'' If a host country says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships are not welcome because they may be carrying nuclear weapons, `` then we have to part company,'' he said. `` Nuclear weapons make some people nervous,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` But they'd be even more nervous if the other side had them and we did n't.'' The law has passed the Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but is expected to face opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. On another issue, <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said his committee had received letters from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> charging that human rights violations there had increased and that vigilante groups are getting official government support. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> replied that he was aware of the proliferaiton of vigilantes and said the development `` has pluses but also minuses.'' `` President -LRB- <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has increasingly recognized that the communist insurgency has to be dealt with with great severity and firmness. ... So the tendency is to reach out and find additional strength'' outside the military, he said. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> cautioned that `` this is a development everyone must be weary of.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should block <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration plans to sell a sophisticated ship defense system to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because the sale would jeopardize both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security and the future of the American shipbuilding industry, the author of the proposed ban said Thursday. The administration `` is unable to guarantee that the Aegis system would be protected from compromise through espionage once it has left the direct control of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs arms control and <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> subcommittees <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was formally notified June 6 the administration had approved the sale of one Aegis system costing $ 526 million during the current fiscal year, with promise of a second system next year and more purchases in the 1990s. Aegis is the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s latest integrated shipboard air defense system, designed to track, select and fire on multiple incoming targets. Senior Defense and State department officials staunchly defended the proposed sale at the hearing, arguing that blocking it would damage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credibility and cooperation with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on vital defense strategy in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. `` I can think of no single action on our part which would do more to call into question the basic aims or our security policy in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region than to say that we have decided not to proceed weith the Aegis sale to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' said Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> termed the sale `` critical in enabling <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to fully assume'' the role of defending its home region in the joint U.S.-Japanese plan for security in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. `` To deny this sale would undercut our policy of encouraging enhanced Japanese military spending,'' he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said Aegis-equipped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships remaining under American command should perform the missions planned by the Japanese. Assistant Defense Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has repeatedly rejected, as recently as last week, demands of some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that its future Aegis-equipped destroyers be American-made. Had the administration insisted on this, he said, `` we would have succeeded only in killing <PERSON> Aegis </PERSON> as a Japanese option ... it would not be politically feasible in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for approval of procurement of an Aegis ship if the hull were built in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, R-Md., said she has inside information that `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wants the Aegis system so badly that she will take it any way she can get it _ even to the point of buying the whole package from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' Ms. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, a former chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, charged that the Japanese and other foreign shipbuilders want to destroy the American shipbuilding industry, now suffering from dwindling orders Accusing the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of ignoring `` the rough-and-tumble world of profit and loss,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said proposals such as the Aegis sale could lead to a situation where `` within 10 years we will have to buy our warships from them -LRB- <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -RRB- because we will not have the capability of building them ourselves any more ...'' She and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> also suggested that through a process of `` reverse engineering,'' Japanese purchasers could learn the Aegis technology once the system was transferred. <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON> said the Japanese government, as opposed to private companies, had an impeccable record of safeguarding sensitive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will ask the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to investigate a Chicago-based group for allegedly illegal campaign contributions. Nearly all the contributions from Citizen Action went to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or House candidates. But at the top of the committee's list was the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for President Committee. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Akey </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, however, that the campaign's financial records showed no contribution from Citizen Action. The allegations were denied by a top official of <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, who claimed the allegations are `` filled with outright falsehoods and clever distortions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> committee alleged at a news conference that Citizen Action and its affiliates in 24 states formed corporations with tax-exempt status that went beyond their legal bounds of promoting issues solely among members. Instead, the committee said, Citizen Action and its affiliates used donations to make a pitch for particular political candidates to members and the general public. In addition, the committee charged, <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> did not report its activities on behalf of candidates as independent expenditures or direct contributions to the candidates. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis., who spoke at the news conference, said the senatorial committee is charging that while Citizen Action enjoys preferential tax-exempt status from the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, it is `` heavily involved in political activities that are completely inconsistent with its tax-exempt status. <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, who said affiliates of Citizen Action worked against him in his 1986 re-election bid, also contended that it is improper to call the group a citizens group because it is `` not volunteer, with ordinary citizens participating in democracy. These are paid, organized workers.'' <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> described Citizen Action's efforts as `` a national conspiracy of radical political groups'' and said the groups `` are guilty of massive federal election and tax law violations.'' In a statement, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON>, vice president of Citizen Action, said the allegations by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> committee `` are filled with outright falsehoods and clever distortions.'' And in comments immediately after the committee's news conference, <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> said that the financial records of Citizen Action and its affiliates are audited regularly by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> `` What we do is no different from what thousands of other groups legitimately do _ trying to win meaningful changes on issues of concern to their members,'' he said, citing as examples the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Specifically, the committee charges that affiliates of the 1.75 million-member Citizen Action are incorporated as either social welfare or charitable organizations under the Internal Revenue Code. Both types of organizations are tax exempt. However, the code stipulates that charitable organizations can not be involved in politics, while social welfare organizations are allowed to engage in partisan politics, but only among members, the committee said. <PERSON> Jann </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsten </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> committee, alleged that members of Citizen Action go door to door, speaking about issues and in the process `` deliver partisan messages on behalf of or against a candidate.'' At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> Olsten </ORGANIZATION> said, canvassers will ask for a financial contribution. `` Money is being given to tax-exempt organizations and it is being used for partisan political campaigns,'' <ORGANIZATION> Olsten </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> added, `` These people are not supposed to be primarily involved in the elections process, but this is a significant election effort.'' <ORGANIZATION> Olsten </ORGANIZATION> said that the committee is asking the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw Citizen Action's tax-exempt status.

<TEXT>
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was criticized Thursday for failing to rid nuclear power plants of substandard nuts, bolts and other fasteners since the problem was discovered in 1982. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has dragged its feet and boggled the whole question,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore. `` You have had since 1982 to think about this problem and it is now 1988 and you are still thinking about it. <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>'s comments came at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> oversight and investigations subcommittee during which <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> officials estimated that up to 20 percent of the fasteners in the nation's nuclear plants may fail to meet specifications. `` We expect standards we require for nuclear plants will be met,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director for operations. `` They have not been met. We are not happy.'' <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> was `` not satisfied'' that nuclear power plant operators had done enough to eliminate substandard bolts and that the commission was studying ways to ensure compliance, including barring the use of bolts supplied by manufacturers with a history of problems. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> plans to move `` agressively'' against manufacturers who supply counterfeit fasteners or fraudulently claim their products meet specifications, <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> said. He said the extent of the problem was just now becoming clear. In addition, <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> said he would attempt to convene a meeting involving other federal agencies that also have faced problems eliminating the use of substandard fasteners in facilities they oversee.

 Former Defense Minister <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a political foe of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, tested his popularity with voters Thursday by running for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, but the special elections were marred by violence. Six people were injured in clashes in the <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION> constituency, where <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> ran on an anti-corruption platform, and voting was postponed because of ballot-stuffing in one village, authorities said. In another election district, a man was shot and killed and 10 people were injured. The contest between <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 56, and singer and film writer <PERSON> Sunil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shastri </PERSON>, 38, of the <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has been closely watched as a barometer of how <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> would fare against <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in a national election. Election results were not expected before Saturday in the <LOCATION> Singh-Shastri </LOCATION> contest. The worst violence reported was in <LOCATION> Palwal </LOCATION> village in the <LOCATION> Faridabad </LOCATION> constituency, about 18 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, when men with guns, knives and sticks tried to storm a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> office, according to dispatches from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> and the Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. It was there that the shooting death occurred. The Allahabad voting was one of seven special elections held Thursday to fill vacancies in the 544-seat lower house of Parliament. Elections for all Parliament seats, which will determine <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s next prime minister, must be held no later than January 1990. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a former ally of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, broke with him last year over what he saw as government footdragging over investigating alleged kickbacks in defense contracts. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> ran as an independent with the backing of several opposition parties against <PERSON> Shastri </PERSON>, son of the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Lal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahadur </PERSON> <PERSON> Shastri </PERSON>. Voting in <LOCATION> Satpura </LOCATION> village in <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION> constituency was postponed until Friday after unidentified men seized the ballots and started filling them out, the constituency's top election official, P.C. <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON>, said. Ballot-counting in the entire constituency can not start until the Satpura situation is resolved, he said. <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON> also said at least six people were hurt when rival groups of political workers clashed near <LOCATION> Naini </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arun </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, a onetime <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ally and former minister of state for home affairs, who now supports <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, told a news conference the Satpura ballot-stuffing was engineered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members. `` It was a planned and systematic attempt to rig votes,'' <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON> also said that V.. <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s nephew, <PERSON> Vikram </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was shot at and injured by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> supporters at <LOCATION> Manda </LOCATION>, 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION> The report could not be confirmed. At another news conference, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Azad </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>'s charges and accused the opposition of `` intimidation and terror tactics.'' V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was an early voter in <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION>, 360 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. An estimated 45 percent of the 850,000 eligible voters took part in the <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION> election, state governemnt spokesman P.K. <PERSON> Asthana </PERSON> said.

 The government admitted Thursday that a security lapse allowed Irish guerrillas to kill six British soldiers by planting a bomb on their van while they were running in a charity race. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility and vowed `` to wage unceasing war'' against British forces in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Townspeople in <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>, seven miles outside <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, gathered behind police barriers in small, silent groups to gaze at the burned-out hulk of the bombed van. Others later approached the site and left bouquets. `` We're just expressing sympathy with the soldiers that are in this country trying to protect us and this is what they're getting,'' one unidentified young woman told <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. TV as she put down a bunch of `` We just hope that their families understand that it's not everyone here that's like that,'' she said. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, appealed to families of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldiers serving in the province to press their government to `` withdraw from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and bring an end to the tragic deaths resulting from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s partition of our country. `` We regret all deaths and earnestly desire peace, but the deaths of the six British soldiers on Wednesday night are part of the price of the British government's intransigence,'' <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> said in statement issued Thursday in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. A half-marathon for charity had just ended Wednesday evening at the close of a warm, sunny day in this garrison town, headquarters for the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> army in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The exploding bomb turned the van into a fireball and scattered torn, burning bodies onto the street. `` I saw two bodies lying in the middle of the road,'' said <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON>, 19. `` One of them had no legs, and one of them was burning. It was badly mutilated. It seems they were blown from the van. There was panic and people were running everywhere.'' Ten civilians were wounded, including a 2-year-old boy and a man of 80, but authorities said none was hurt seriously. Political leaders in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> joined prominent Protestants and <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> on Thursday in denouncing the attack. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said in the House of Commons the bombing was a `` terrible atrocity'' and reiterated the government's determination `` to defeat the terrorism of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, which shoot and bomb to kill.'' Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the government's top official in the province, conferred with army commanders in <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to report to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a vital need for everybody to pay the closest attention to personal security,'' he told reporters. `` It's absoluely standard practice I think, tragically, it does seem clear that this was not followed in this case.'' The soldiers had traveled to <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION> from their barracks in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, in the north of the province, in a blue van not marked as an army vehicle. The bomb was believed to contain Czech-made explosives, and experts were trying to determine how it was detonated. An editorial in the independent <ORGANIZATION> Belfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, the province's largest newspaper, said the `` professionalism in fixing the bomb without detection, in an open car park, is chilling.'' It noted that soldiers were barred from participating in civilian events after two were killed when they blundered into an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral cortege in March. The soldiers had been permitted to join the <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION> event, however, and the paper asked how the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> found out. `` Somehow the word must have leaked out,'' it said. `` The bomb was ready and the van was identified. The level of intelligence needed was considerable, in a garrison town.'' An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement delivered to newspapers and other media in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> said it planted a seven-pound bomb for what it described as an `` execution.'' It was the highest death toll since an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb in <LOCATION> Enniskillen </LOCATION> last November killed 11 <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> civilians, and the highest army toll since 11 soldiers and six civilians were killed in a 1982 pub bombing near <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>. `` Until that -LRB- British -RRB- presence is removed and the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> people as a unit can exercise our right to national self-determination, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> will continue to wage unceasing war against the British crown forces and the British colonial apparatus,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> says it will stay as long as the majority wishes. Most Protestants, who outnumber Catholics 3-2, are loyal to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and oppose union with the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> republic. The army identified the dead soldiers as: Cpl. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalfe </PERSON>, 36; <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Cpl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambie </PERSON>, who would have been 23 on June 29; <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Cpl </PERSON>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paterson </PERSON>, 22; Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, 31; <PERSON> Signaller </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Clavey </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Cpl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 20.

<TEXT>
 Amid the empty Gatorade bottles, flattened tubes of sun block and stacks of fetid sweat socks, 14 <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students leapfrogged their way into the record books Thursday. Actually, the pace was more like a few steps of jogging, then a leap. And the 14 _ who were at it on the soccer field in two-hour shifts, round-the-clock since Friday afternoon _ were n't exactly bounding with energy. But according to the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, that qualifies as leapfrogging, and at 11:30 a.m. the students `` frogged'' past 662 miles, breaking the record set by a fraternity at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonz </PERSON>, both seniors, made the record leap. `` People ask which hurts more _ the bending or the leaping,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, 17, between swigs of Gatorade. `` It's the jogging in between.'' The students, who planned to continue leaping until they reach 888 miles _ estimated to happen sometime Saturday morning _ are raising money for the <ORGANIZATION> Norris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth-Hitchcock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. So far, passers-by have donated $ 2,000, and the students are n't sure how much they will raise in pledges The students formed four-person teams to frog in shifts of two hours on, four off. In between, they cheer each other on, eat, sleep, spray each other down with hoses, soak aching ankles in coolers of ice and take final exams. `` I studied this morning at seven o'clock with flash cards,'' while leaping, said <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Creagh </PERSON>, 18. <PERSON> Creagh </PERSON> said the students are averaging 19 leaping miles a day, most of it in temperatures in the 90s during the first heat wave of the summer. A cluster of tents in one corner of the field, called `` Frogville,'' is home to the leapers, and candles in paper bags mark the path around the field at night. In one tent are some instruments and a stereo, upon which the students played the theme from the film `` Chariots of Fire'' as they broke the record. Despite the excitement, most of the leapers are looking forward to the end. `` I have not done it before and I will not do it again,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Changing Policy On Coverage Of Persian Gulf Operations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon has decided to stop forming `` pools'' of reporters to cover <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> operations in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and instead will try to accommodate requests from news organizations on an individual basis to board <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships. The change in policy, announced Thursday in a brief statement, does not change the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment `` to keeping the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people informed about the activities of military personnel serving in the gulf,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. Rather, the department is now going to try `` to accommodate the many requests received from news organizations asking for the opportunity to send representatives to ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>,'' the statement added. `` We're ending the pool,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary for public affairs. `` We will come up with a procedure that works for everyone. This is as much a result of requests from various news organizations as it is at our inception.'' The Pentagon has operated a `` regional press pool'' in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> for almost a year now, helping the news media to cover the efforts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to protect reflagged <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers plying the waterway. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> is a key ally of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the Iran-Iraq war and won permission from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration last year to re-register its ships under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag after they became special targets of Iranian forces. Under the press pool procedure, a small group of reporters representing the major wire services, broadcast networks, news magazines and daily newspapers was formed periodically and sent to sea with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships escorting tankers. The dispatches filed by the pool reporters were then sent through military channels and released to all news outlets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The pool system is commonly used by the press when there are more reporters asking to cover an event than there are spaces available. A pool reporter is expected to share with all other reporters the information he gathers on the media's behalf. According to Thursday's statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has now decided that absent an emergency or the outbreak of fighting, there is no need to keep dispatching press pools to ensure coverage. Rather, efforts will now be made to accommodate individual reporters from organizations that have not been part of the pool. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Persian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pool </ORGANIZATION> will be discontinued on July 1 and in its place, unilateral embarkations will begin, with plans for a contingency pool as necessary,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The success of the regional pool was due to the cooperative efforts of news organizations and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> to solve the problems faced in working in a difficult environment. But the time has come to make this change.'' The procedures for setting up regional and national press pools were devised in the wake of the 1983 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, during which the Pentagon prohibited news coverage.

<HEAD>Attorney: Asner To Pay Child Support</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Actor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> will pay more than $ 2,100 monthly to the mother of a 10-month-old child he fathered out of wedlock, a lawyer said Thursday. Under the agreement, <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> must pay $ 2,000 for expenses and $ 100 for medical insurance each month to support <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogelman </PERSON>, said attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Supancic </PERSON>, who represents the former husband of the child's mother. The actor, who admitted paternity, must also pay the mortgage on a $ 300,000 condominium where the child lives with his mother <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogelman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Supancic </PERSON> said. The agreement ends seven months of medical tests and testimony. <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>, star of television's `` Bronx Zoo'' and the old `` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show'' and `` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>,'' eventually conceded the child was his. The actor became involved in the court action when Ms. <PERSON> Vogelman </PERSON>'s ex-husband, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, alleged his $ 3,000-a-month alimony payment was being used to support a child that was n't his. Under the court-supervised agreement, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> must pay $ 2,000 monthly to Ms. <PERSON> Vogelman </PERSON> for the next three months, $ 1,500 monthly for the following 10 months and $ 1,000 monthly thereafter. `` We thought it was a little out of balance that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> was paying such a high monthly sum when a man of Mr. <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>'s stature had become involved with Ms. <PERSON> Vogelman </PERSON> and they had conceived a child together,'' <PERSON> Supancic </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> said only that <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Vogelman </PERSON> had reached an oral agreement that was being put into writing. He did n't dispute the figures detailed by <PERSON> Supancic </PERSON>.

<HEAD>North Dakota Farmer Says 1,000 Acres Of His Grain Lost To Drought</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STERLING, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> looked across a 30-acre wheat field Thursday, at shafts of grain barely a foot tall and shriveling from the prolonged drought that has hit <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> harder than any other state. `` The best purpose for this right now is the cows,'' he said, digging into dirt that was bone dry three inches below the surface. `` What we are trying to do now is get enough grazing to get the cattle through the summer.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s farm, which has received less than an inch of precipitation since January, normally would be lush and green this time of year. Instead, his pastures are parched and his grain crops are wilted. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> figures the 1,000 acres of wheat, oats and barley that he planted this spring already have been wiped out. `` We are not even going to start the combine this year from what I can see.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> farmers are selling off cattle, plowing under crops and filing crop insurance claims while the drought Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> characterizes as the worst since Dust Bowl days grips the state from border to border. The drought is expected to cost the state 40 percent of its farm income and seal the fate of many farmers who already were struggling financially. `` We did n't need this,'' said economist <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leholm </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The economy in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> was starting to rebound. We had crop prices that were starting to rise, not wildly, but mildly. Livestock prices were pretty decent,'' <PERSON> Leholm </PERSON> said. The drought could cost the state's economy at least $ 2.7 billion, a loss that could throw it into another tailspin, <PERSON> Leholm </PERSON> said. Direct crop losses on wheat, barley and oats will total about $ 500 million. Because market prices are higher, producers will also receive about $ 400 million less in federal deficiency payments, he said. `` We have got large sections of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> where they are estimating that 70 percent of the crop is already gone,'' <PERSON> Leholm </PERSON> said. The drought is more widespread than the last one in 1980, <PERSON> Leholm </PERSON> said. `` The last real wipe-out was in 1961,'' he said. If adequate rain does n't fall by mid-July, the threshhold for planting later forage crops, another 10 percent of the state's farmers could be put out of business, he said One crop insurer, Rain and <ORGANIZATION> Hail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, already has received about 500 crop damage claims from its 4,500 policy holders, said <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wollmann </PERSON>, a field supervisor. `` They are coming in at about 100 a day lately now. And that's only going to get worse,'' <PERSON> Wollmann </PERSON> said `` I would guess that there would be very few insured we have policies with that would not be filing some kind of claim.'' An estimated 40 percent of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s farmers carry crop insurance, which basically covers a farmer's cost of production, officials said. `` The way they are looking right now, if we get by paying $ 7 million to $ 8 million -LRB- in losses -RRB-, we will be lucky. It could be double that, easily,'' <PERSON> Wollmann </PERSON> said. For <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, his major struggle right now is trying to find feed for his 160 head of cattle, a herd his family has been building for 20 years. Already, he's sold off 32 cows and some calves for lack of feed. `` I am sure, if things do n't change, there will be some more going.'' His alfalfa fields are brown, except for low spots that might yield some bales of hay if it rains, he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> intends to maintain at least 100 cows, which could force him to ship the cows elsewhere, perhaps <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, for feeding this winter, he said. Weather forecasts are so depressing <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has quit listening to them. What he would have heard Thursday was a prediction of temperatures in the 90s and high winds. `` You watch the sky and hope. That's about it,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said.

 Blacks took a self-proclaimed national holiday Thursday, boycotting jobs and praying at churches to commemorate the 1976 <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> riots that set off months of violence. Two bombings were reported in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and police said a guerrilla blew himself up accidentally. The first bomb wrecked part of a commuter rail line in the city's black township of <PERSON> Langa </PERSON> and the second went off in the lobby of a civic center during a meeting of the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, causing damage but no injuries. Reports said some trains from <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> were stoned and passengers had to lie on the floor. Firebombs were thrown at buses and delivery vans in other townships, causing serious injuries to three blacks. Police said the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla movement fighting white domination, had planned a major offensive to coincide with the anniversary but was at least partially thwarted. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said 11 suspected guerrillas had been killed in the past week. One was killed Thursday near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> by explosives he was carrying, another blew himself up Tuesday and nine, including three women, were killed by police in two shootouts near the <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> border, <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said. The state-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said police were tipped off that guerrillas based in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> would try to enter <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> for `` massive acts of terrorism'' Thursday. In each of the two shootouts, it said, police stopped vehicles at roadblocks and riddled them with bullets after someone inside opened fire. The African National <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement from its headquarters in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> paying homage to blacks killed in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> 12 years ago and pledging to `` escalate our political and military offensive.'' Many blacks have regarded June 16 as a holiday since 1976, when nationwide rioting broke out after police fired on a student march in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s main black township. At least 575 blacks were killed in the ensuing months, when the anti-apartheid movement acquired a new militancy. No official holidays mark events of specific significance to the 26-million black majority, but several black unions have negotiated with employers to have June 16 as a day off. Many factories closed Thursday, and the largest daily newspaper for blacks, The Sowetan, did not publish. Workers at three diamond mines struck to demand that their employer, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Beers </PERSON>, join other companies in making the day a paid holiday. Commemorative church services were held in several black townships. Reports said security forces fired tear gas and bird shot because of stone-throwing that occurred as blacks left a church service in <LOCATION> Lamontville </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. About 15 people gathered at <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>'s Avalon Cemetery at the grave of <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Pieterson </PERSON>, a 13-year-old shot by police during the march in 1976. <PERSON> Pieterson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Margot </PERSON>, 17, and his nephew, <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabane </PERSON>, 6, put flowers on the grave, which bears a marker saying: `` Deeply mourned by his parents, sisters, and a nation that remembers.'' <PERSON> Popi </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, 29, wounded in the 1976 shootings, came to the service in a wheelchair. Later, 1,500 people attended a service at <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>'s largest <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. At one point, two white men in civilian clothes were chased by members of the crowd who thought they were policemen and grabbed cameras they were carrying. The crowd dispersed hastily after the service with many policemen looking on. The <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> students 12 years ago had been protesting a range of grievances, particularly the use of Afrikaans in their schools. In July 1976, the government announced that black schools could choose their language of instruction but activists say most other demands, generally related to giving black communities more control over their schools, have not been met. Mining executives said 24,500 of 540,000 black employees at major mines were absent Thursday. The biggest stayaway was at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION> gold mine, where 86 percent of black workers were absent. <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION> was the site of the nation's worst gold mine disaster when 177 men, all but five of them black, died in a fire in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which carries hundreds of thousands of black commuters from their townships, reported a 90-95 percent stayaway in the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> area, 50-80 percent in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and about 30 percent in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. Many stores in downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> because black employees were absent.

 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a 15-point lead over Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll released Thursday, largely on the strength of overwhelming support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> among women. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was supported by 49 percent of the registered voters in the poll, to 34 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported. Among men the split was 46-40 for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but among women his margin was 52-28. The national survey of 2,014 adults was conducted June 9-12. Its result was similar to that of a Gallup poll, conducted June 10-12, that found a 14-point <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lead. Two other polls early in June put his lead in single digits; others in May had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead as great as 16 points. The `` gender gap'' facing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also appeared in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll last month, which suggested he trailed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> narrowly among men but by a 2-1 margin among women. In another measure, the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll Thursday found that only 38 percent of women said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cares about people like them. In another important measure of voter sentiment, poll respondents said by a 2-1 margin that it is time for the nation to change direction rather than to follow the course set by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. And while 49 percent approved of the job <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been doing as president, 39 percent disapproved. Respondents disapproved, 48 percent to 41 percent, of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's handling of the nation's illegal drug problem _ an issue in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken a prominent role. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was rated higher than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on handling the nation's economic problems, reducing the federal deficit and dealing with drugs <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was rated higher on defense and foreign policy. The margin of sampling error in the telephone survey was three percentage points.

 <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s tumultuous ride as governor of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> ruined his business and landed him in two courts. But it left him the same man as when he started: a political outsider railing at the system that refused to work in his favor. Eighteen months ago the outspoken Republican was at the top, a prosperous automobile dealer who had finally won the chance to govern his state after five tries for the office. Now the governorship and the auto business are gone, one lost when he was convicted by the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in an impeachment trial, the other sold because business was lagging under the weight of bad publicity. Now another critical chapter has been closed: <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, were acquitted Thursday of criminal charges related to the alleged concealment of a campaign loan. The 64-year-old ex-governor had faced six felony counts and up to 22 years in prison on charges of hiding a $ 350,000 campaign loan on personal and campaign financial reports required by the state. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faced three similar counts and up to 9 -LCB- years in prison. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> insisted throughout his trial that the charges were based on `` smoke and mirrors,'' but he had stopped short of predicting that the <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury would find him innocent. Although he said for months he wanted nothing more than to get the facts out regarding the loan from attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>, neither <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> nor his brother took the stand during seven days of testimony. It was an uncommon spell of official silence for the combative <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who testified in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment court and who never shrunk from speaking his mind as governor. As <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s chief executive he angered many constituents by canceling a Martin Luther King holiday on grounds it was illegally created and by saying he did n't believe the slain civil rights leader deserved a holiday. He was criticized for defending a book's use of the word `` pickaninny'' for blacks. Other statements deeply offended Jews, homosexuals, women and Japanese-Americans. But <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> never backed away from his comments, and he remained defiant even after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him April 4 on impeachment charges of misusing money from a state protocol fund and trying to thwart an investigation of a death threat. A son of Mormon farmers, a fighter pilot in World War II, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> put himself through college by selling cars in the rural town of <LOCATION> Ajo </LOCATION>. In 1950 he moved his <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> dealership to <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> suburb. He published his own newspaper in the 1960s as an alternative to the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> press. He also developed a virtual hobby of running for public office. He won his first race in 1960, gaining a two-year term in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But he lost a 1962 bid for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and ran unsuccessfully for governor four times, including a near-miss in the 1978 election against Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>. Fortune finally turned in <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s favor in 1986, when he shocked the political establishment by winning the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary and the three-way general election race. Even after taking over as governor, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> saw himself as an outsider attacked by an establishment of legislative leaders, the news media and Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, a fellow Republican. In <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s eyes, those forces conspired to force him out of office and into criminal court. But even before the jury returned its verdict, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> declared he had been vindicated by the testimony. It `` has been totally revealed to the world that there was no conspiracy -LRB- to hide the loan -RRB-,'' the former governor said when the defense had rested its case. Although <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> often appeared haggard during his legal ordeal, at other times he seemed anything but a broken man as he joked with the reporters he has blamed for helping bring him down. In any case, he insisted all along that nothing would destroy his peace of mind. He often quoted <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, saying he would be happy if he eventually won out but if he did n't, `` 10 angels swearing I was right wo n't make any difference.''

<HEAD>Air Force Awards Contract For Rocket To Carry Satellites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> awarded the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> a $ 135.3 million, first-phase contract Thursday to provide a new medium-lift booster rocket to ferry defense communication satellites into orbit. The service announced a month ago it had selected <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> over another team consisting of the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to build the so-called Medium Launch Vehicle II. Following that decision, negotiations were opened to finalize a contract and that has now been done, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> added. The service plans to purchase 11 of the new booster rockets over the next few years. The first-phase contract covers research and development expenses along with construction and launch services for the first two boosters. Over the life of the program, each of the new boosters `` will cost less than $ 40 million a copy and save the taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars in the process,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> `` Pete'' <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON>. `` That's the result of competition.'' The MLV II is part of an ambitious acceleration of umanned rocket programs started by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> after the loss of the shuttle Challenger. The General Dynamics booster, designed to handle payloads in the 6,000-pound class, will be a variant of the oft-used Atlas Centaur launcher dubbed the Atlas II.

<TEXT>
 A senior official in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> blamed nationalists influenced by the Armenian Orthodox Church for protests in a territorial dispute, a Hungarian newspaper said Thursday. In what it called an exclusive interview with <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> state prosecutor <PERSON> Ilias </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying the disputed <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region `` has never belonged to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'' and `` any return is out of the question.'' The parliaments, or Supreme Soviets, of the two southern republics held separate votes this week. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s decided not to give up <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and the Armenian parliament backed demands by protesters that the mountainous region to be incorporated into <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. About 80 percent of <PERSON> Ngorno-Karabakh </PERSON>'s 160,000 people are ethnic Armenians. It was assigned to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923 but Armenians consider it part of their ancestral homeland. `` You can only return what has been taken from you, legally or illegally,'' <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> has never been part of Armenian territory.'' <PERSON> Magyar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirlap </PERSON> did not say when it obtained the interview with <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON>, which it said was conducted in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Unrest over the fate of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> began in February with mass street protests in the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, and strikes and protests in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Violence folowed in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, where 32 people were killed in ethnic rioting in the port city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, most of them ethnic Armenians. Soviet authorities said a policeman was killed in further unrest in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> last week. The Soviet Communist party daily Pravda reported last Friday that a general strike had virtually shut down industry and agriculture in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> for three weeks. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> report, <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON> said: `` What is happening in <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> was well organized in advance ... by Armenian nationalists ... and under the influence of <LOCATION> Echmiadzin </LOCATION>,'' center of the Armenian Orthodox Church. `` The whole ideology originated in <LOCATION> Echmiadzin </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON> said, referring to the religious center outside <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. Despite his accusations associating <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s church with the unrest, <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON> said the conflict should not be seen as a religious clash between Armenian Christians and the predominantly Moslem people of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. `` There is an attempt to give a religious color to the conflict, saying Christians do not want to live under Moslem sovereignty,'' <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON> said. `` To put it mildly, this is a malicious approach to the question _ there is no religious basis to this conflict.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> challenged Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Thursday to come up with a price tag for his proposal to junk the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inititative </ORGANIZATION> and replace it with a buildup in conventional forces. `` Where do you go when you get into the most expensive side of this of all, which is conventional forces?'' the vice president asked, speaking with reporters on Air Force II. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, deputy issues director for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, said substantial funds would be freed up by halting work on the so-called `` Star Wars'' missile defense system. `` The administration is now proposing to spend $ 4 billion on SDI,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` The governor feels those funds can be ... devoted to areas of greatest needs.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has accused the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee of lacking experience on foreign policy and defense issues, said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's proposals could jeopardize efforts to reach a strategic arms treaty with the Soviets. `` My question to him would be: are you talking about the winnability of a conventional war without any reliance whatsoever on a nuclear deterrence? I do n't know how he'd answer that question. But if he answers yes, then I think he's wrong,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And where's the price tag?'' he asked. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> earlier this week, in a major foreign-policy speech in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, voiced opposition to the MX missile and for SDI, calling instead for a `` Conventional Defense Initiative.'' `` I do n't think that's a good concept,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told reporters he sees no problem with the fact that his newly named communications adviser, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, and his law and consulting firm are registered lobbyists for Japanese business companies. Noting that <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, who was named to the campaign post on Monday, is a volunteer and not a salaried campaign worker, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I do n't think there's a conflict at all. Are we going go now and look at every client for every law firm for every volunteer?'' <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>'s firm, <ORGANIZATION> Robinson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lerer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, of which <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> is chairman, represents <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corop </ORGANIZATION>. and <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, according to reports in the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he had no recollection of ever having met a former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> president, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON>, who testified that he was introduced to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as part of an effort to obtain help on a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pontoon contract. <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON> made the claim on Wednesday in testimony in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> corrpution trial. He said <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> had raised $ 200,000 for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1984 re-election campaign as part of its effort to win the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract. `` Was the guy ever at a fundraiser or something? Maybe. But I do n't remember anything, the name or anything about him,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Asked whether he had any advice for syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who shot and wounded a teenage intruder in his back yard earlier this week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` No, I do n't have any advice for him. I'm not having much fun out of it. I think it's a matter where I ca n't make much of a contribution to it by saying anything.'' Noting <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s own strong views in favor of gun control laws, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added: `` I suspect it's causing him some difficulties sorting out in his own mind, given his strong position on gun control, with which I very much disagree.'' `` I kind of emphathize with him on what he was going through when somebody was coming up at him. It's all easy to second guess now.'' In a speech to an annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> here, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated his views on strong penalties for those convicted of drug offenses and said the policy of `` zero tolerance'' for drugs should be applied to the workplace as well as to cars, planes and boats. The vice president has proposed mandatory drug testing for prison guards, airline pilots and for others responsible for the public safety, and has suggested that all companies with government contracts have `` drug free'' programs for their employes that might include some form of drug testing. `` There are those who say that drug testing is an invasion of individual rights. But the use of drugs ... is a matter that affects the lives of others,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his audience that while the government could not require drug-testing or drug-education programs of private businesses, `` each of you, pesonally, can stand up against drug use.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he fully supports the zero-tolerance policy under which yachts and other vehicles on which drugs have been found have been seized. `` I do n't mind inconveniencing a yacht owner or a car driver if it results somehow in saving the life of one kid,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In his talk with reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Two </ORGANIZATION>, on the way home to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I just ca n't get too excited about the yacht owner, even though some would like you to believe I am one.'' `` Mine is 28 feet long. I want that in there too,'' he said, referring to the $ 40,000 racing powerboat that he keeps at his vacation retreat in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A search warrant obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and made public Thursday reveals the background and the theory of the government's investigation into possible corruption involving the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and private contractors. The following are excerpts from that search warrant, which was issued by a federal judge in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Justioce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> request to search an office at <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest defense contractor: `` <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> resigned from his position as Assistant Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for Research, Engineering and Systems in April, 1987. In April, 1987, <ORGANIZATION> PAISLEY </ORGANIZATION> opened his own private consulting business in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> area. As a consultant to defense contractors, <ORGANIZATION> PAISLEY </ORGANIZATION> provided advise -LRB- sic -RRB- to corporations and contractors who do business with varous agencies within the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>. One of his consulting contracts is with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>. A large portion of his dealings with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> are with or go through <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>, a vice-president in marketing. `` DOD awards approximately 150 billion dollars worth of contracts every year. <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION>, through its constituent agencies, makes decisions in areas for the acquisition and award of contracts to further the national defense. At various stages, decisions are made in <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> and the military departments concerning the development of defense materials, equipment and services and the allocation of funds appropriated to <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> for the national defense. `` Information and data used to develop and implement the acquisition strategies are often closely held by <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> and its military departments and are of value and interest to companies seeking contracts from DOD. A company with such advance information can prepare more advantageously for procurements which are likely to be upcoming. Moreover, if a company learns of the Government's plans, the company can evaluate the plans and try to influence the decision makers to make modifications which would favor the particular company As such, a company may want to influence a decision about the size of a particular procurement, the specifications for the items being procured, the prerequisites which a company must meet in order to be eligible for the award of the procurement, or the weighing which the Government will use in evaluating different aspects of all competitors' proposals. `` Once <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> decides to seek a particular procurement, a majority of the contracts are awarded following a competitive bidding process. <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> has contracting officers who oversee the bidding process and are assigned within the various military services -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. The process begins with an advertisement for a new contract which is followed by companies receiving a document called a Request for Proposal -LRB- RFP -RRB- which details contract specifications and other contractual requirements. `` A time limit is set for the recipients to respond with their offers. Generally the price submitted by a company is critical to the company's winning a contract because the Government usually awards the contracts to the lowest bidder which is technically qualified to complete the contract. Once the initial offers have been submitted, the Government analyzes the offers for both technical expertise and price. The government determines a competitive range based upon the technical and pricing factors. If it is determined that at least two of the companies' offers are within the competitive range the competitive process is continued for those companies. `` The government holds discussions with each company and tells it where its offer is weak technically. The companies are then asked to submit their Best and Final Offers -LRB- BAFO -RRB-. The BAFO provides them with the opportunity to adjust their offers with respect to the price and the portions that were technically weak. However, if the Government determines that only one company's offer is within the competitive range, the Government can award the contract without a BAFO stage. `` Information about a company's competitors' offers and the Government's evaluation of those offers is never disclosed to a company prior to the award of the contract. Therefore, a company which has access to that information prior to the time when <ORGANIZATION> BAFO </ORGANIZATION>'s must be submitted can benefit greatly The information can assist the company in deciding how to modify its own offer. `` The information can also help a company learn that it has no chance of winning a contract. Then the company can decide to either drop out of the bidding or to seek to influence the Government to withdraw the <ORGANIZATION> RFP </ORGANIZATION> and change it in a way to be more favorable to the company. `` In addition, companies can obtain an edge if they obtain information about the Government's intentions which have not been disclosed prior to or during the bidding process. For instance, the Government may not have disclosed the amount of funds it has budgeted for a procurement or its estimates of how many options it will exercise under a contract containing options. Such information can help a company in drafting its proposal. `` The scheme involves the illegal disclosure of information and the exertion of influence with respect to <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> contracts. The information disclosed is often provided by Government employees receiving bribes or gratuities. The disclosed information has been of the type that can provide a company with an unfair advantage over its competitors and @ or the government. A substantial portion of the disclosed information is classified or confidential. `` As a defense contractor consultant, <ORGANIZATION> PAISLEY </ORGANIZATION> relies upon Government officials to provide <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> contract information which is not available to the contracting public. <PERSON> PAISLEY </PERSON> then provides this information, for a fee or as part of his `` consulting contract'' to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, who is a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> contractor. <PERSON> PAISLEY </PERSON> has provided <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> THOMAS </PERSON> <PERSON> GUNN </PERSON> substantial information obtained from Government officials which has been classified and @ or confidential or not available to the contracting public. This information has included the following: `` 1 -RRB- information regarding <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> proposed sale of its F-18 fighter airplane to the Swiss government, including internal information of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> regarding the Super Hornet configuration; a proposed letter to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> regarding the F-18; information regarding <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> and Final Offers -LRB- BAFO -RRB- on the Swiss contract; inside information pertaining to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> F-16 proposal; `` 2 -RRB- information regarding a co-development plan with the French government regarding an updated F-18 -LRB- called FA-18 -RRB- including an internal <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> study; `` 3 -RRB- information regarding the sale of F-18s to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> including, names of individuals with ability to influence the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Government to approve the sale of F-18s to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and; `` 4 -RRB- information relating to sale of F-18s to <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- EFA -RRB- nations, including a telex from an <ORGANIZATION> EFA </ORGANIZATION> nation Embassy -LRB- <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> -RRB- dated axpproximately February 3, 1988, notes on Keb briefing on the Hornet 2000; documents on the APG 65 Radar; and letters from the Germans on the APG 65 Radar; and letters from the Germans on the radar for the F-18; `` 5 -RRB- the summer of 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> study; `` 6 -RRB- early 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> study regarding the 500 MG Helicopter -LRB- Killer Egg -RRB- and the future helicoper needs of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>; `` 7 -RRB- information relating to the Advanced Tactical Aircraft program, including BAFO information.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> laid the foundation Thursday for their general election battle in the South, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trumpeting a tough anti-drug stand in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> seeking to unify his party in a region that was once its stronghold. A new poll said the two men are locked in a tight contest there. And another survey out Thursday gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a double-digit lead nationwide. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> started a regional campaign swing with a stop in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> to pick up the endorsement of former Democratic presidential rival <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is going to carry our party to victory in November.

He's charmed them in all of those different debates. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, the only senator to back <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has locked up the nomination, but he said his vote at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention would be based on <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' support of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` He won my home state; he certainly has earned my vote,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met with 33 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators as he pressed for more unpledged `` super delegates'' to the July Democratic convention to support him. He said the party leadership `` while accepting my investment in the party to make it strong, has not been as reciprocal as it ought to be.'' `` If I invest, I should reasonably expect return,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters. `` So I appreciate the accolades that I am the voter registration champion for the party, that I have led the drive to return the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> back to the Democrats ... If I have done all of that, I simply say let's be fair.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> welcomed <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s support and said he looked to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to join the bandwagon. `` I would hope <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will be a part of this campaign and as early as possible,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added his backing to the idea of a special outside counsel to probe charges against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who will preside over the Democratic convention next month. He said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had welcomed the idea, and he called that a stance that `` contrasts rather sharply with the kind of stonewalling we've had from the administration on case after case after case.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> distinguished his support for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> from his call for the resignation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` That's after repeated evidence of insensitivity, a lack of awareness of what we mean when we talk about high standards,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` If you're attorney general of this country and you've stumbled as often as he has and made as many mistakes as he has and provided as weak leadership as he has, you ought to leave office.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with his budget cramped by federal spending limits, went only as far south as <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president declared drugs `` the ultimate fatal attraction.'' He also renewed his call for companies to put anti-drug programs in place before they can receive federal contracts. `` The point is that stopping drugs in the workplace is not just a profit and loss issue, it's a matter of protecting the health and safety of workers,'' the all-but-certain Republican presidential nominee told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> annual meeting. `` It's no less important than <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> regulations on the conditions of machinery.'' `` The federal government should not dictate what kind of drug-free program a company should have, but it should require any federal contractor to have one in place,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also demanded `` Where's the price tag?'' for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s advocacy of increased spending on non-nuclear forces, which the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor called a Conventional Defense Initiative, to replace President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' deputy issues director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> replied that the administration has earmarked $ 4 billion for SDI, and that freeing up those funds would help finance other military spending. Drugs were <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s topic in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, where he denounced calls for legalization. `` That would be a mistake. It would be surrender to the No. 1 threat to our national security. We would not think of legalization of smog because there's a lot of it. It's dangerous,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got some good news as he started his three-day Southern swing. A new poll in nine Southern states said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are neck-and-neck in the region once called solid for the Democrats. In recent years, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidates have counted a strong showing in the region, but pollster <PERSON> Claibourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ca n't make that assumption. `` I think everyone has to be surprised at how well <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is doing in the South,'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself is doing more to break the Republican ` lock' on the South than <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is doing.'' The telephone poll of 750 voters gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the support of 45 percent and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the backing of 42 percent. Thirteen percent were undecided. Given the poll's sampling error margin of 4 percentage points, that finding is a dead heat for the states involved: <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. And in another poll, this one nationwide, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a 15-point lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> survey, conducted June 9-12, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had the support of 49 percent of the registered voters polled, compared to 34 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The survey suggested <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead was based largely on overwhelming support among women, where he held a 24-point lead, 52-28. The national survey of 2,014 adults had a margin of sampling error of 3 percentage points, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Candies made from enough heroin to kill a child are the latest way smugglers are trying to bring the drug into <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, customs officials said Thursday. Twenty pounds of the fake candies, each containing the equivalent of nearly $ 550 worth of heroin, have been discovered in the luggage of smugglers arriving from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in the past three weeks, the officials said. The total value was put at $ 1.34 million. The officials said they were alerting customs officials in other countries, of the danger. `` Somewhere in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> there is a factory compressing, glazing and wrapping heroin to look exactly like sweets,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Curr </PERSON>, assistant chief investigations officer. `` If they are stolen by kids or otherwise get into their hands, just one sweet will kill a child,'' he said. `` Even touching it by unwrapping the cellophane will leave a rash as the heroin is absorbed into the skin.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, chief press officer at national customs headquarters in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said heroin disguised as candy was seized before at a British border but called it `` a relatively new trend in smuggling techniques.'' He said smugglers usually baked the drug until it was black and looked like licorice, then wrapped it in real candy wrappers. The fake candy was found in two confiscations involving five passengers coming in from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which is known as a drug source, <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Measure Aimed at `Colorized' Movies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With actor <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> looking on, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee approved a measure Thursday that would create a commission to act against `` colorized'' black-and-white movies. Among other things, those movies could not be shown under their original titles if the measure becomes law _ which even backers concede is doubtful. Disregarding objections that the action was an infringement on the rights of other congressional committees, the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> refused, 25-20, to delete the anti-coloring provision from the $ 9.7 billion appropriations bill it later passed for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and related agencies. Several committee members, including the chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Miss., argued that the committee should not proceed because the decision belongs to the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and its copyright subcommittee Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, wrote <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> to object to the procedure `` Obviously this is not going to survive the Rules Committee,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a supporter of the measure. `` But if it survives this Appropriations Committee, it will send a signal.'' The measure is similar to a proposal pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It would set up a nine-member commission to judge which films are significant enough to deserve protection. Those films, if significantly altered, could not be shown or distributed without disclosure of the alterations and the desire of the director or principal writer to disassociate themselves from the changes. Black-and-white films to which color had been added could not be shown or distributed under their original titles. The issue arose last year after <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, owner of a gigantic film library, began releasing black-and-white classics such as `` The Maltese Falcon'' in computer-colored versions. Many film buffs and directors have objected that the process perverts the vision of the makers of the original film. `` I find it offensive for a government body to designate what is art,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., leader of the opponents of the provision in the committee In addition, `` We are saying that property rights -LRB- of the owners -RRB- should be limited or terminated.'' <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON> argued that the issue was one of vandalizing art that ought to be protected. He read a telegram from director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> that complained the current owners of his 1940s film with <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, `` It's a Wonderful Life,'' had `` splashed it all over with Easter egg colors and ruined it.'' Referring to <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s role as the reforming senator in `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Goes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., argued, `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> would have been standing up in this committee arguing against the bypassing of committee procedures. The 80-year-old <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> expressed elight after the vote, saying, `` Nobody was quite sure who was going to win right up to the end.'' Adding color to black-and-white movies, he said, is `` really a terrible practice and something that should be outlawed.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the principal studio-producer trade association, said <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>'s opponents had only about five votes when the issue moved into the committee a few days ago. `` There was a big change in my direction,'' he said. <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>'s opposition is bound to be influential from here on, he added.

 Authorities on Thursday detained Vietnamese boat people as illegal immigrants, instead of granting them asylum as refugees from their communist country as has been <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s policy for 13 years Officials arrested 78 Vietnamese who came ashore, under a tough new policy to stop the influx of boat people to this tiny British colony. The detainees will be returned to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> unless they can prove they face political or religious persecution back home. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Emrys </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> `` saw enormous difficulties'' in taking back large numbers of boat people and had given no indication it would accept them by the early 1990s. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> is punishing people who organize the exodus from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> but added that it was difficult to patrol <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s long coastline Since the Vietnam War ended in 1975 with the communists taking over the goverment, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has considered all boat people to be refugees fleeing persecution. The policy was reviewed as the number of Vietnamese arrivals rose to nearly 8,000 this year, of which only 1,200 have been resettled. Government officials say prospects are dim for finding homes for more than 16,000 refugees now in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> camps. Under the policy, boat people who fled for economic reasons will be detained until they can be sent back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Those who can prove they faced persecution in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will be granted refugee status and become eligible for resettlement. One of the Vietnamese who was detained told reporters that his boat carried more than 30 relatives. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dai </PERSON> <PERSON> Quy </PERSON> said he did not know of the new policy when he left his home in central <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> two weeks ago but would have fled anyway. The 32-year-old man said he was a political refugee, noting that the Communist government did not allow him to pursue deep sea fishing and that his children could not attend school. He claimed his mother was killed by <PERSON> Viet </PERSON> <PERSON> Cong </PERSON> and he was a volunteer soldier for the pro-American <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> army during the war. `` I hope the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government will change its policy and let me get out,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday authorized expanded use of an experimental drug for Parkinson's Disease, a development that could benefit 30,000 Americans with severe forms of the ailment The drug, selegilene, can be distributed under the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s relatively new category called `` treatment IND'' in which promising experimental therapies can be prescribed for desperately ill patients before completion of the more extensive review required for full-fledged new drug approval Selegilene is the fifth drug to win such a designation under the new regulations adopted last year. The `` IND'' in the definition stands for `` investigational new drug.'' Distribution is to be administered by the drug sponsor, <ORGANIZATION> Somerset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, which has an application pending for full approval to market the drug under the trade name Eldepryl. Physicians treating patients with severe <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s who have had difficulty with standard treatment can contact the company for detailed information about the drug's distribution, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The most widely used treatment for Parkinson's involves use of the drug levodopa. However, that drug's effectiveness often gradually decreases with long-term use and it needs to be given in larger amounts that can produce increasingly severe side effects such as nausea, involuntary bodily movements, flushing and palpitations, said an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> announcement. Parkinson's Disease is a serious, degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that can affect people 40 and over. It is believed to be caused by reduced levels of a naturally produced substance in the brain called dopamine. Selegilene surpresses some of the enzymes in the body that inactivate dopamine.

 Dozens of furious steelworkers attacked government offices in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> after learning that part of their factory would be closed, officials said Thursday. Five traffic police and a doorman were injured when they tried to block the workers. Hundreds of laborers gathered Wednesday in front of the state-owned Italsider steel mill in <PERSON> Bagnoli </PERSON>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, to protest plans announced a day earlier to close part of the plant. After the rally, at least 200 steelworkers went to <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. They burst into the offices of the <LOCATION> Campania </LOCATION> regional government, smashing desks and chairs and hurling furniture and plants through the windows, news reports said. Workers then proceeded to City Hall where they wrecked furniture and knocked paintings off the walls. Police arrested 30 people and charged them with causing damage. Others involved in the riot were being sought. The government said Tuesday it will cut 25,000 jobs from its money-losing steel industry under a restructuring plan. The Italsider plant employs 4,000 people.

<HEAD>Parliament Passes Limited Economic Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliament has passed reforms that give state enterprises more say in production, make them self-financing and could reduce the economic bureaucracy by 30 percent, the government said Thursday. The limited package passed in a special three-day session is patterned after Soviet reforms that prescribe self-management and self-financing for state enterprises and cooperatives while taking away some or all state subsidies. <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said state companies will be directly subordinate to ministries and that eliminating middle-level bureaus could bring a reduction of up to 30 percent in the economic bureaucracy. The reforms, which take effect next Jan. 1, were passed after a yearlong debate. During the rest of this year, companies that account for 30 percent of industrial production will be involved in an experiment that gives them greater control of production decisions. Czechoslovak officials gave few details on plans for economic reform, which they approach with caution. Decentralization of management will not go as far as in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and will not take full effect until 1991. Premier <PERSON> Lubomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON> acknowledged in May that the economy had not improved under his government. He said the number of committees and bureaus between enterprises and ministries will be reduced and the direct responsibilities of ministers increased. The once-efficient economy is plagued by low productivity, a poor industrial structure, unbalanced supply and demand, and growth of unsold inventory. <PERSON> Jaroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Matejka </PERSON>, an architect of the reforms, told a news conference last month only 48 percent of companies had applied for the new status that brings more independence. He said some feared being put out of business. Managers will be elected by secret ballot in the plant, according to the new law, but the government retains the right to nominate candidates for the jobs. New trade legislation will allow companies to make contracts of cooperation with others inside the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION> trading group without first seeking government permission, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said. Some enterprises will be allowed to deal directly with Western companies, bypassing foreign trade offices that now act as middlemen. A new law on cooperative enterprises, which employ 1.5 million people, affects those in both agricultural and housing and could increase their efficiency, the agency reported. Housing cooperatives alleviate the chronic housing shortage in a country where thousands of people have waited years years for new apartments. Agriculture subsidies now cost $ 3 billion a year. <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Toman </PERSON>, the agriculture minister, raised the possibility of people being allowed to buy land. `` There is a situation ... when the new law allows transfer of land not suitable for socialist large-scale production ... to other ... socialist and social organizations and individuals,'' <PERSON> Toman </PERSON> told the daily <PERSON> Lidova </PERSON> <PERSON> Demokracie </PERSON>. He gave no details.

<TEXT>
 Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> on Thursday called for an expanded <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> role, including a naval force, a space agency under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> auspices and a body to monitor disarmament pacts. `` This is a revolutionary change in our attitude toward the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>, deputy head of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation to the current disarmament session, told a news conference. For years, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government has been wary of the 159-member world body, but recently it has sought to strengthen it and develop a comprehensive <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> security system, a vague concept opposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as unrealistic. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been playing a major role in the current <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session on disarmament. It has also paid its <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget debts and increased the number of Soviet citizens on permanent assignment as civil servants at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> owes more than $ 240 million in <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> dues. It is cool toward most Soviet proposals regarding the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and does not wish to see an expanded <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> role that could infringe on national prerogative. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was `` delivering our <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> policy from dogmas and subjective approaches, but ... we have every right to expect similar self-criticism, responsibility and reason from other states, too.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, he said, should become `` a unique center for harmonizing actions of states in our interdependent world.'' <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said all nations should disclose to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> information on their troops abroad and their foreign military bases. But, asked if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would make the first step and disclose its military information, <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said: `` This is not a one-actor theater, but the world stage. We are ready to participate in the exchange of data if other countries, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, do the same.'' In its month-long session on disarmament, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is expected to adopt resolutions and a final document setting out a realistic agenda for disarmament and arms control. Western diplomats have indicated that if the documents are unacceptable, there will be no consensus and there could be divisive votes. The Soviet proposals include: _ Creation of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> naval force aimed at maintaning freedom of navigation, and holding a joint trial exercise with fleets of the permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ U.N supervision of troop withdrawal from foreign territories and the expansion of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has proposed elimination of foreign military presence and military bases in foreign territories by the year 2,000. _ Creation of an international monitoring and verification agency, covering both disarmament and political settlement of conflicts and crises _ Creation of a world space organization under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices to ensure safeguards in making outer space strictly for peaceful purposes The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> regards many of the proposals as infringements upon its ability to behave unilaterally in its own interests and pursue, for example, its space-based anti-missile defense initiative, known as `` Star Wars.''

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee approved prohibitions Thursday on oil and gas drilling for another year in federal waters off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The bans were contained in the $ 9.7 billion appropriations bill for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and related agencies that the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> sent to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. Earlier in the day, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> announced a delay of at least six months in the planned lease offering for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> waters to try negotiations with affected <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> governors. The sale originally had been scheduled for next February. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> also split the offering for <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> waters into two parts, with the 44-million-acre non-controversial section to be offered in November as scheduled. An offering on other gulf waters will be delayed at least six months while two federal-state task forces conduct additional studies on oil spill trajectories and the effects of any spills on the southwest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast. Last week, <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> similarly delayed the offering of leases off northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> until next October. The committee's provisions, if upheld by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, will apply until Sept. 30, 1989. There have been several previous bars to drilling enacted similarly as riders to appropriations bills, and most of the argument Thursday covered ground familiar to the members. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> provision was enacted without discussion. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> question is complicated by the presence of 73 previously awarded leases that were suspended for three years for special environmental studies recently completed. An amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Regula </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, to delete the 73 tracts from the 16 million acres of prohibited area south of about <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> down to the Keys was defeated. `` The very modest amendment offered by Mr. <PERSON> Regula </PERSON> here today is simply to say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will live by its commitments,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Regula </PERSON> himself argued that the issue was, `` Can we take back the rights that people have paid for, namely $ 220 million?'' More generally though, <PERSON> Regula </PERSON> argued that `` To year after year place a moratorium on -LRB- drilling -RRB- does n't address the problem.'' The issue really belongs before the Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> provisions expand the prohibited area substantially from what it has been in past years by barring drilling in waters less than 400 meters deep -LRB- 1,312 feet -RRB-, compared to 60 meters -LRB- 197 feet -RRB- previously. <PERSON> Regula </PERSON> offered an amendment to make the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> area conform to what was prohibited in previous years, but was defeated on a voice vote. New <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> opponents of offshore drilling say the prohibition is needed to protect the rich, shallow <ORGANIZATION> Georges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> fishing grounds off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, and the 400-meter provision was chosen to conform to provisions of a 12-year Canadian moratorium in adjacent waters adopted earlier this year. The action closes about 3.5 million acres to drilling and leaves about 2 million acres available for offering in a February auction. Opposing the committee proposals, <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said there might be no bids if promising shallow-water areas were ruled off limits off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Speer </PERSON>, staff attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and long-time opponent of offshore drilling, said after the vote: `` This is a major victory. This takes the pressure off and will allow the next administration to take a look at the offshore program.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said the action if upheld `` would mean the abandonment of any meaningful effort to find new supplies of oil and natural gas offshore, and is a severe blow to the nation's future energy security. ... The record of oil company offshore operations clearly shows that oil and gas is being extracted without harm to the environment, to economic activity, tourism, fishing or wildlife.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, flooded with tens of thousands of complaints from private pilots, on Thursday curtailed its proposed requirements for altitude tracking devices on small planes. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> announced a final regulation which calls for private pilots to have the altitude equipment when flying within 30 miles of 27 of the country's busiest airports and in restricted airspace around 109 additional airports. Three months ago the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said it was considering a much broader regulation that would have banned private pilots from airspace within 40 miles of 254 airports unless they had the equipment that tells air traffic controllers a plane's altitude. Under the new rule, small planes also will be prohibited from flying at or above 10,000 feet without the altitude encoding equipment. Originally the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had suggested requiring the equipment on small planes flying as low as 6,000 feet. The final regulation falls short of what the airlines had wanted and closer to what the private pilots of small planes had sought. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said the regulation should reduce the danger of an aerial collision involving a small aircraft. He called it `` a major positive impact on safety.'' Currently the altitude encoding transponders are required on small planes only if they fly inside controlled airspace around the 27 busiest airports. The new requirements will be phased in beginning in July 1989. The move to broaden requirements for altitude-reporting equipment stemmed from the 1986 aerial collision over <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in which a small plane without such equipment collided with a Mexican airliner killing all aboard the two aircraft. The airlines and commercial pilots have argued that small, private planes should have the altitude encoding equipment whenever they fly in airspace used by commercial jetliners. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had called on the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to broaden its requirement for the so-called Mode-C radar signal transponders on private planes. But when the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> suggested in February that it might require the equipment at 254 airports, it unleashed a flurry of protests. According to estimates by the <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, more than 80,000 letters were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> complaining about the proposal. The private pilot group argued that the additional signals from the increased number of transponders would overwhelm the air traffic controllers _ a claim disputed by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> _ and that the additional requirements were being proposed for airspace near airports that are not heavily used by commercial jetliners. Pilots also complained about the estimated $ 600 to $ 2,000 cost for the altitude encoding transponder. Commercial jets as well as most sophisticated private planes that fly in and out of the busiest airports already have the equipment. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> long has required any aircraft flying within so-called terminal control areas _ rings of airspace of varying size around the 27 busiest airports _ to have the altitude encoding equipment. The rule announced Thursday would require the equipment for flights within 30 miles of the 27 airports beginning in July 1989. At 109 additional airports, which have less restrictive airspace, private planes must have the equipment when flying within that restricted area or up to 10,000 feet beginning Dec. 30, 1990. Other airports may be designated as requiring small planes to have the Mode-C equipment within 10 miles, but the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said only two airports so far have been singled out. Small planes flying within 10 miles of <LOCATION> Billings </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, must have the equipment beginning in 1991.

 That hum of air conditioners pulled power demand to peak levels as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englanders </LOCATION> kept fighting the heat Thursday, while cooler weather prevailed for parts of the Plains and thunderstorms hit numerous regions of the nation. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pool </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of 95 utilities which coordinates electrical power for the region, recorded a record demand Thursday and another utility, <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had record power demand for the second time in two days for the 40 communities it serves around <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Some <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> workers called the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to see if a state law allowed them to go home once the temperatures reached a certain high. The icy answer: No. Readings were into the low to mid-90s from the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> valleys through central parts of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Record high temperatures for the date were set in <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, 91; and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, 93. Temperatures were more comfortable from the northern Plains into the upper Great Lakes. Readings were in the 70s across much of the region with temperatures in the 50s and 60s across northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The low for the nation Thursday morning was 35 at <LOCATION> Alamosa </LOCATION>, Colo. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55 degrees at <LOCATION> Marquette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Crescent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to 108 degrees at <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Showers and thunderstorms extended from western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> through the lower <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, but they brought little relief to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> where only a quarter-inch of rainfall has been reported Showers and thunderstorms also developed across the <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, where rainfall is eight to 13 inches below normal for the year. Heavy rain and small hail were reported Thursday afternoon as storms moved across extreme southeast <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and southwest <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Thunderstorms were scattered early Thursday afternoon across northern parts of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and western parts of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. Showers and thunderstorms were rapidly developing across parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and along the front range of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>.

 An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> killing six soldiers, and the recent arrest of two suspected Japanese terrorists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, magnify security concerns for the seven-nation economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> next week. Police helicopters are already whirling over downtown skyscrapers at night and border immigration checks have been tightened, Metropolitan Police Staff Superintendent <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON> said Thursday. `` The biggest threat is terrorism. Historically, they've always been active at summit conferences. They have a way of getting into a country illegally,'' <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON> said police were investigating a news report from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Thursday that a <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> suspect arrested in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> last week was planning to establish a base there for attacks on the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> Summit and the Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Police are also focusing on the safety of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who narrowly escaped injury when the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bombed her hotel in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, on Oct. 12, 1984. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for a booby-trap bomb in <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, on Wednesday which killed six British soldiers taking part in a charity race. `` We're uncomfortable any time British royalty visits, or anyone connected with the British government,'' said <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON>. `` We're always concerned that the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> could be active. Protecting Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the leaders of five other summit nations and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> has been made more difficult by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s decision to hold the summit in the country's biggest city. Previous North American locations for the annual event have been <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, Montebello, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The last major city to host the summit was <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in May 1986, when <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s radical Middle Core Faction fired five homemade rockets into the downtown area. No one was injured. The possibility of an attack on Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> arose in April when a suspected Japanese Red Army terrorist, <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, 35, was arrested on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION>. Police found three pipe bombs and false papers in his car. An 18-year-old Japanese college student, <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON>, was detained June 12 in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> after police found a rifle, grenades and ammunition in his luggage. Police are equipped with computer-enhanced photographs of all known <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members, and a helicopter-borne rapid deployment assault squad staged a demonstration at an <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> military base this month to send a message to would-be terrorists. `` The public will never see them unless something happens,'' said <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON>. Canadian Solicitor General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> said the government is spending $ 4.9 million on summit security and deploying 3,000 officers and agents. <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Thursday: `` While we have no specific threats at this time in any respect, there is a high level of risk and we must be very careful and make sure nothing untoward happens.'' <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON> said eight security forces are involved, not counting secret service agents brought by the world leaders. They are the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, Canadian armed forces, <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Provincial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, Peel and York regional police forces. Sharpshooters with high-powered rifles will be posted in office towers, up to 15 city blocks will be sealed off as motorcades ferry the leaders to and from their hotels, and city expressways will be closed for 15 minutes at a time as delegates are escorted to dinner engagements in the suburbs. `` We've had people in and out of here for four or five months,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boutette </PERSON> of the Old Mill restaurant west of the city, where finance ministers dine Sunday night. The first arrests occurred Wednesday when police broke up an anti-summit protest at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> and charged 15 people with trespassing. Police denied permission for an anti-war group, <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Violent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, to march down <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where the leaders will meet. `` Demonstrators could occupy the attention of police and allow terrorists to act,'' <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON> said. He said police also worry about random attacks by `` unstable persons'' like <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who shot and wounded <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981. Despite its setting in a city of 3.4 million people, the summit will take place in a security cocoon. `` At no time will the delegates be on public view,'' said <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> Police Chief Jack Marks. Local resident <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> called it ironic that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> walked the streets of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a place he once dubbed an `` evil empire,'' but <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> is not considered safe enough for him to emerge from his armored limousine.

 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was found innocent Thursday of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, a partial vindication for the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor impeached and removed from office in 59 years. Minutes after the clerk had read the jury's last `` not guilty'' finding on the six counts against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, the judge declared the trial over and <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s supporters cheered. `` Justice can occur in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> when you get to the people and outside the politicians,'' the 64-year-old former governor told reporters outside the court. `` We're happy, we're happy. You're always apprehensive but not really surprised. He said he would hold a news conference Friday morning. As the final verdict was read, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> smiled broadly and hugged his attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, then turned and embraced his wife, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>. Then he crossed to the jurors and began shaking their hands. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> asked Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> could make a statement, but the judge refused, saying `` This is a court of law, Mr. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> had acknowledged he did not itemize the $ 350,000 loan from developer and attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> on either his personal or campaign financial statements. The defense said the failure was an innocent mistake, partly due to <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>'s inexperience as a bookkeeper. However, the prosecution insisted that the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> badly needed the <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> loan to keep his campaign afloat, then hid it to avoid spoiling his theme of being `` beholden to no one.'' The jury had deliberated 6 -LCB- hours after receiving the case Wednesday following seven days of testimony. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> could have been sentenced to 22 years in prison if convicted on all six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents. His 67-year-old brother faced a maximum 9 -LCB- years on three counts. Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said after the verdict that he had offered to let <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> plead guilty to a misdemeanor before the trial began, but <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> turned him down. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and removed from office on April 4 when the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of misusing money from a state protocol fund and trying to thwart an investigation of a death threat. He had also faced an impeachment trial on the loan concealment charge, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided not to consider the matter to avoid prejudicing the criminal trial. The former auto dealer had run for governor four times unsuccessfully before he won a three-way race in November 1986. Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> secretary of state who took over <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s post after he was removed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, said in a prepared statement that she hoped her predecessor `` and his entire family can resume their lives as private citizens.'' `` The end of this trial signals a hastening of a healing process which has begun and that the citizens of this great state so richly deserve,'' she said. Outside the courtroom, prosecutor <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON> said that he had `` we had an obligation to present this case'' and that he had `` no quarrel with the decision.'' `` We believe we presented a responsible case that had to be presented. We obviously felt we had a good case.,'' <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON> added `` A lot of the people in this community feel that he has suffered enough, and perhaps that was a factor.'' <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON> said he felt the key issue was whether either <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> or <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> `` had the intent to break the law when they filled out the disclosure forms'' and that the jury obviously did n't feel they had such intent. Judge <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, addressing the jurors before dismissing them, told them that `` this case was zealously litigated by both sides, very well done job by both sides.'' `` I think that your verdict has shown that there can be a fair verdict, a fair trial for all parties in this system,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> added. `` I think you're a credit to this system and I think that this system can do the job even under intense and high publicity situations.'' When testimony ended Friday, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> told reporters the prosecution had not proven its case, which he said was based on `` smoke and mirrors.'' Neither defendant took the stand. Former top <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> testified for the defense that the loan was `` common knowledge'' among <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s inner circle. However, former <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> insiders <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> testified that they did n't learn about the loan until October 1987 when it was revealed by the media. Bur the prosecution said it was immaterial whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s closest aides knew about the <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> loan The main point, prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> said, was that the loan was not listed on the public disclosure forms required by the state. A state accountant, <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, insisted that the failure to list the loan could not have been simply a bookkeeping mistake by <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. `` This one transaction stands out above all other transactions,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` It's the largest single transaction by far. The receipt is recorded a month after the fact. The name on the receipt is <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, not <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>.'' The jury's makeup was an issue before selection began, when <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> acknowledged in April that he asked a group of backers to `` remain quiet'' about their support of him if asked to serve on the jury. The former governor contended he was only joking, however. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> became engulfed in controversy just one week after taking office in January 1987, when he canceled a Martin Luther King holiday for some state workers on grounds it was created illegally. He said King did n't deserve a state holiday, and later caused another storm of criticism by defending the use of the word `` pickaninny'' in a book. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also made remarks that angered women, Jews, homosexuals and Japanese-Americans. The former governor also was accused of making a series of substandard appointments to top state positions. Before <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, the last governor impeached and removed from office was <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> in 1929.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday passed a far-reaching welfare bill designed to help people break out of poverty through jobs, backing it almost unanimously after acceding to White House demands for more stringent work requirements. The vote on the Family Security Act was 93-3. The five-year, $ 2.8 billion measure requires stepped-up child support collections and creation of a comprehensive education, training and jobs program. Long-term welfare recipients or those likely to become long-term, such as teen-age mothers, would receive particular attention. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who wrote the bill and fashioned a broad coalition of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> supporters, said it would make fundamental improvements in a system that has not changed in 53 years. For <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, who was a presidential advisor and a professor before joining the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the lopsided vote capped decades of studying and seeking welfare reform. `` This is the most important legislation of its kind and the first legislation of its kind since the welfare system was established in the 1930s,'' he exulted. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said that under the current system, `` One child in four in this country will be on welfare by age 18. That's where we were headed yesterday.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> called the <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> bill `` an opportunity ... to set an entirely new direction for the outdated and ineffective system we have today.'' And Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., described it as `` the best hope'' for lifting people out of poverty and restoring their dignity Voting no on the bill were Sens. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>. Not voting were Sens <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del.; <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>; Chic Hecht, R-Nev., and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, R-Idaho A bipartisan group of senators negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials throughout the week following word last Friday that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto the <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> bill as it stood. The main obstacle as the bill neared passage late Thursday was a White House demand that some welfare recipients be required to participate for 16 hours a week in `` workfare,'' or community work projects, to work off their grants. Governors of both parties opposed the provision to phase in mandatory workfare participation by one adult in each two-parent welfare household. But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> offered it as a floor amendment and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed it by voice vote after refusing 54-41 to kill it. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said the provision would affect only 6 percent to 7 percent of the welfare caseload. Only nine states have statewide mandatory workfare programs. Some governors said it would be expensive, cumbersome and unnecessary in their states. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said workfare is pointless for people who need retraining rather than work experience and in areas where the labor market is strong. Senators agreed to other White House requests as well, including a requirement that state job and training programs include 22 percent of eligible participants by 1994. The agreement added about $ 200 million to the five-year cost of the bill, bringing it up to $ 2.8 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> already has passed a more generous, $ 7 billion welfare plan. Negotiators for each chamber will reconcile differences in the two bills before a plan is sent to the White House. Whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> supports the final measure depends largely on the extent to which <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members are willing to go along with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> product. Aid to Families with Dependent Children, established in 1935 as part of the Social Security system, currently supports 3.7 million families which include some 7 million children. Originally conceived as a widow's benefit when women _ especially mothers _ did not work outside the home, the program now is dominated by divorced and unwed mothers at a time when the majority of new mothers are at work within a year of having a child. The centerpiece of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills is a new jobs program under which states would have to offer a wide range of activities including job training and basic education as well as actual work. They would have to include as many people as they could afford, and half the money would have to be spent on people needing the most help. A 1987 study of current welfare-to-work programs found that they did not have nearly enough money, that they offered limited and superficial services, they lacked essential support services such as child care, put too much emphasis on job placement rates, funneled people into low-paying jobs that did n't get them entirely off welfare, excluded mothers of children under 6 and tended to help people who really did n't need it while ignoring tough cases. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills attempt to correct most of these deficiencies. Each envisions a substantial federal financial commitment to the jobs program and describes or mandates activities to be offered. They improve child care benefits and guarantee child care for people in the program. Mothers with children under 3 would be exempt from the work-training requirement, and states could lower that to age 1. Both bills also require states to extend welfare benefits to poor two-parent families. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill only would require the benefits for six months in any 12-month period; 26 states already provide year-round coverage. A major difference in the two bills is that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> offers extra federal money to states that raise benefits to needy families, which in many cases have incomes well below half the federal poverty line. Money to cover additional spending under the <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> bill would come from making permanent a tax refund withholding program to recover federal debts, and eliminating the business food and entertainment tax deduction for people with incomes over $ 440,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the meals and entertainment provision Thursday in place of a provision phasing out the dependent care tax credit for higher-income families. Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, sponsor of the substitute, said the original plan would have constituted a tax on child care and added, `` I'm against punishing women for their professional success.'' The <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> bill attracted opposition not only from conservatives seeking tighter work requirements but from mothers who said they should not be forced to work at all. A group called Wages for <ORGANIZATION> Housework </ORGANIZATION> complained that the measure was `` designed to get women off the welfare rolls, not out of poverty, and denigrates the work of all mothers.''

 <LOCATION> PHILADELPHIA </LOCATION> _ The leading presidential candidates must address black Americans' concerns or face losing the support of `` a sizable number of people,'' the head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` Those folks who want to go into office _ Gov. -LRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ and do n't take those populations that we represent seriously, then we will not take them seriously,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Prichard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` Whatever it takes for us to send that signal to them by not voting for them or voting for folks who share our views, we'll do that,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were invited to attend the conference, but only <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has confirmed that he will speak Saturday, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` We want to caution those folks who tend to ignore these meetings and who are running for various offices who do n't spend time discussing our agenda,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a Republican. `` If they do n't show up here, we have decided at this conference to organize our populations ... and say to those folks who are running for office what we want to do,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, joined at a news conference by <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> and about 20 of the 200 mayors attending the four-day conference. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he doubts <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will be selected as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate because of the `` further continuation of the attitude of the Democratic party in its liberal traditions of looking at black folks simply as appendages, as followers rather than leaders. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should sit down and resolve the issue. `` He's earned the right to be considered,'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said. `` He's earned the right to be respected as one of the leading leaders of our party `` If he's not granted that respect, then I think there's going to some very difficult times in front of us as a party.'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, vice chairman of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s delegation to the Democratic Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, criticized party rules that force him to go as a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegate. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said he plans to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the first ballot, even though rules require him to vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` As far as I know, slavery ended a long time ago,'' he said. `` I will do it.'' Economic, racial and health problems have emerged as other major concerns of those attending the 14th annual convention, which runs through Saturday.

 Ever wonder what would happen if you really let a bull loose in a china shop? So did <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. So much, in fact, that he put the cliche to a test in his own store on Thursday. Nothing happened. `` I'm pretty relieved,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> admitted after fulfilling what he said was a lifelong ambition _ letting a 2,400-pound bull roam through his store for three hours. `` We managed to get him out of the shop before anything happened,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. Not that there were n't tense moments. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said $ 60,000 worth of <LOCATION> china </LOCATION> was at stake during the romp by the bull, nicknamed `` The Colonel.'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said he attempted the feat at his shop in <LOCATION> Palmerston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>, after constantly being egged on by customers familiar with bull-in-a-china-shop cliche. While `` The Colonel'' shopped around, <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said, he got a call from a radio station in <LOCATION> Stoke-on-Trent </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, known as the home of bone china. Representatives of the Guinness Book of World Records as well as the international media also turned up to watch the stunt. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> took some precautions. Before the event, he said, he insured his china at an undisclosed premium. Just in case.

 A French woman said she was mistaken when she thought her grandson was the unidentified, hearing-impaired boy found last year wandering the streets of <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> thought photos of the boy strongly resembled her grandson, <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, but the 13-year-old boy was located Thursday in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. Mrs. <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> said Thursday night in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that she had just spoken by telephone with her son, who told her that he, her daughter-in-law and her four grandchildren were in good health. Since January 1987, she had not heard from her son, who runs a restaurant called `` <ORGANIZATION> JJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION>'' in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> arrived at the restaurant as I was talking to my son,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> said. `` For all that, the mystery of this child is not solved. I am delighted for me and I am very upset for this child.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> said her daughter-in-law's mother in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had been very ill and possibly had died. She speculated that the family could have been on their way to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at the time of the plane crash. Mrs. <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>'s daughter-in-law, <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, said: `` I saw the news last night, and they were talking about it and my daughter <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> and I were laughing and saying it sounds like something <PERSON> Mamie </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> -RRB- would do. But we just did n't believe it could be her She showed a picture and it did n't look much like <PERSON> Filipito </PERSON>. `` Knowing her, it sounds like something she would do ... I ca n't get over it But being so far away from -LRB- her son -RRB- and not knowing his whereabouts, I can see where she would jump on this.'' <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> contacted the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Tuesday after recognizing the boy from pictures in a French TV news report. She said her daughter in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> also was struck by the resemblance. On Thursday she gave the embassy a dozen family photos of <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> that were forwarded to authorities in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` The resemblance is more than passing,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> English, chief of special consular services at the embassy, who received the photos. Since he was found last November, <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have been trying to identify the boy, nicknamed <PERSON> Sabat </PERSON> because he was found on a Saturday _ sabado in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION>. Authorities do n't know <PERSON> Sabat </PERSON>'s real name or where he's from, but they believe he is 7 or 8 years old. He has been staying at a child-care center in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> since he was found. <PERSON> Sabat </PERSON> is deaf in his right ear and has 25 percent hearing in his left ear. He communicates mainly through gestures and drawings. His pictures indicate that he survived a plane crash that killed his sister and parents. If <PERSON> Sabat </PERSON>'s relatives ca n't be found, he will be put up for adoption in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, authorities have said.

<HEAD>Iraqis Claim They Recapture Peak In North</HEAD>

 Iraqi forces recaptured an Iranian-held mountain peak in <LOCATION> Sulimaniyah </LOCATION> province in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Thursday, the army said. Senior army spokesman <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabar </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhsen </PERSON> told reporters the Iraqi 1st <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> took the strategic <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Romi </PERSON> mountaintop in a major offensive launched Thursday. The mountain, more than 6,500 feet high, overlooks an entire Iraqi valley. It is just over four miles from the Iraq-Iran border and about 25 miles northeast of Sulimaniyah, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s largest northern city and the provincial capital of the Kurdish region. The Iranians captured the peak and the adjacent town of <LOCATION> Mawet </LOCATION> in fierce fighting last summer. <PERSON> Muhsen </PERSON> gave no battle details, but the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the air force flew 221 combat missions on Thursday with all aircraft returning safely. <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> said helicopter gunships completed 115 of the missions. Heavy use of helicopter gunships is usually an indication that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is trying to counter ground assaults by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Iraqi communique reported fighting a several points along the 730-mile-long border between the two countries. An Iranian news report Thursday said a rebuilt F-14 fighter jet successfully completed test flights at an air base in <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>German Chancellor Covers Farm Subsidies, East-West in Address</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The family farm in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> must remain viable and subsidies can not be rolled back overnight, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> told the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the first West German head of government to address <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s legislature, acknowledged criticism of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Common Agricultural Policy and the $ 300 billion global farm-subsidy war. He said he opposed permanent subsidies in principle but added: `` When developments have taken a long course over 20 years, you can not remedy the situation overnight ... the family farm must remain viable in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s future.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has proposed phasing out agricultural subsidies by the year 2000, and Canadian officials had hoped for a compromise at the seven-nation Economic Summit which starts Sunday in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said in welcoming <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> that summit nations `` must come to grips with the acute problem.'' But the 12-nation European Community has been reluctant to dismantle subsidies to small farmers because of the political outcry that would follow. In a wide-ranging, 55-minute address, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> likened the new U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement to <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> plans to create a unified market for goods by 1992. That uniform market of 320 million consumers will remain accessible to other countries, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said, and he counted on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to ensure the same will be true of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> under free trade. `` We trust the assurances of our Canadian friends that <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> companies, too, will be able to use the new opportunities to increase trade.'' The U.S.-Canada treaty, due to take effect Jan. 1 if ratified, would eliminate all tariffs over a 10-year period and dismantle other barriers. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> arrived Wednesday night for his first official visit to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, prior to the Economic Summit. Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> on Thursday to tour the west coast province. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said his government's central goal is to overcome the division of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the rest of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` to make the frontiers more permeable, to reunite separated families, facilitate human contact and develop a lasting and equitable, peaceful border.'' He thanked <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for stationing 7,000 troops among <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces in his country and said allied solidarity had contributed to recent arms control breakthroughs by the superpowers. He said the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's superiority in conventional weapons and capacity for surprise attack are now the basic problem in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> security. `` Eliminating these capabilities must be the objective of future negotiations,'' which he hoped would begin this year, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. The chancellor concluded by recalling the aid his country received after World War II. `` We were half-starved. I felt at that time what it means for a country to receive help ... and we have n't forgotten that. He said it was a moral duty to extend similar aid now to the Third World, declaring, `` I'm one of those who believe that in the first quarter of the 21st century, the hazards and challenges of the North-South conflict -LRB- industrialized nations and developing nations -RRB- will overshadow East-West problems.''

<TEXT>
 A billboard advertising campaign for <ORGANIZATION> Porcelana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cream </ORGANIZATION> that features light-skinned black women as `` faded beauties'' shows a lack of sensitivity toward minorities, blacks said Thursday. `` I saw the billboards, and I could n't believe this thing was coming back again,'' said <PERSON> Sharmain </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, chief of staff for state Sen. <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` I was definitely offended by it.'' The Porcelana billboards show the product name, a close-up photograph of two light-skinned black women and the words `` Faded Beauties of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>.'' One billboard, before it was covered by a new advertisement, was embellished with graffiti that changed `` faded beauties'' to read `` faded pride'' and the words `` Stop Racist Advertising'' were written across it. Fade creams are frequently advertised in black-oriented magazines for correcting uneven skin tones or diminishing scars and blemishes, but critics say the billboards imply lighter is better. Officials for the Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Dep </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes and distributes <PERSON> Porcelana </PERSON>, declined to comment on Thursday. <PERSON> Porcelana </PERSON> might not have meant to promote the cream as an overall skin lightener, but the possibility is the crux of the problem, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, executive editor of The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, a tri-weekly that is one of the oldest black-owned papers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know if it's out and out blatant racism that makes for these kind of decisions, but there seems to be a certain lack of sensitivity that is born of out of some form of racist attitude,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` The issue is not so much that particular billboard,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` The issue is the treatment of black folks in advertising across the board.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> researcher who has studied the effects of minority-targeted advertising said The controversy might be an example of a company misjudging the message it sends to consumers, said <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a marketing professor at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> who has studied the effects of minority-targeted advertising. `` Even if they did n't mean to offend, what you have to be concerned with is the decoded message _ what did it mean to the consumer,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` If that decoded message is leading to a negative perception, regardless of the intent of the advertiser, they should change -LRB- the advertisement.'' In an atmosphere of increased minority pride and activism, advertisers can find themselves in trouble if they fail to consider the sensitivity of their target group, he said. Black consumers wield well more than $ 200 billion of purchasing power, while Hispanic consumers have more than $ 100 billion, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` I think you're going to find more and more consumers who are going to use that purchasing power to reward those advertisers who are sensitive to their issues,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. Advertisers who aggravate minority consumers may find that consumers not only avoid a product, but may actively campaign against it, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador condemned as `` vile and horrendous'' Thursday the rebel killings of an <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural adviser and his Peruvian colleague and another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said such workers may be withdrawn from danger areas. `` <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> were men who dedicated their lives to helping Peruvian campesinos -LRB- peasants -RRB-,'' Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said in referring to the attack Monday on an isolated road near <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, 125 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Officials said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON>, 27, were shot by leftist Shining Path guerrillas in a highland insurgency zone near <LOCATION> Aramachay </LOCATION>, a mountain hamlet 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>. The words `` This is the way the lackeys of <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> imperialism die'' and a hammer and sickle were scrawled in red ink in <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>'s notebook, according to reporters at the scene The Shining Path, an 8-year-old Maoist insurgency, has frequently assassinated development workers in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s impoverished highlands in an effort to spawn economic chaos. The victims were working on a project funded by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which spends more than $ 50 million yearly in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> on farm, health and food relief programs, agency officials said. The officials refused to say if the attack would prompt the agency to alter or limit its Peruvian operations. AIDhas about 20 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agents here and dozens of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Peruvian technicians work under special contracts. But a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who supervises a research program funded by the agency said meetings were planned to discuss withdrawing workers from potentially dangerous rural areas. The official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> sent investigators to find out if <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>'s killing was circumstantial or represented a decision by Shining Path leaders to target Americans <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> was `` just a kid wanting some experience'' before returning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for graduate school in August, one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> development official said on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. Following an autopsy Thursday near <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, the bodies of the men were taken to <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, the embassy said. Officials said the families, including <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON>, will travel to the Peruvian capital Friday. The guerrillas shot each man in the back of the head after halting the four-wheel-drive vehicle they were driving, police said. The attackers then dynamited the vehicle and fled in a truck, the police said, adding that 100 people were arrested in sweeps of the area after the killings. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, was the second American to die in the Shining Path's eight-year insurgency to impose Marxist rule Dozens of Peruvian development workers have been among more than 10,000 people killed in the violence.

<HEAD>Playing Bagpipes Can Damage Hearing, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 High noise levels from bagpipes can knock a Scotsman's hearing out of kilter _ and even cause permanent hearing loss, a neurologist and amateur bagpiper said Thursday. Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rutland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, and audiologist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartenstein </PERSON> measured noise levels produced by the bagpipes and reported their findings in a letter in the June issue of the Archives of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Indoor and outdoor levels at the player's left ear reached up to 105 decibels, they wrote. Noting that federal noise exposure maximums are 105 decibels for one hour and 115 decibels for 15 minutes, they said it would be fairly easy for pipers to meet or exceed these limits `` with steady, dedicated practice.'' Good quality foam ear plugs can sharply cut noise levels, they said. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON>, who said he had been playing the pipes about three years, became concerned when he found playing the pipes was almost a painful experience at first. He said he started wearing earplugs, but believes few pipers are aware of the risks of permanent hearing loss and few probably wear ear protection. He said the ear protection he wears reduces the sound level about 25 decibels and does not interfere with hearing and evaluating his own playing.

 Mutilation rapist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was offered $ 10,000, living expenses and a one-way ticket out of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Thursday by a car dealer and a radio station anxious to get him out of town. In a full-page newspaper ad, <LOCATION> Bradenton </LOCATION> car dealer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimus </PERSON> offered $ 5,000 and volunteered to pay rent and utilities for six months _ at a non-Florida address _ for the 60-year-old former merchant seaman. <PERSON> Stimus </PERSON>, 49, previously has offered rewards for the assassination of <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, with no takers. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>'s WQYK-FM matched Stimus' $ 5,000 offer after 99 percent of hundreds of listeners responding to an on-air poll said they wanted <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> to leave, said station spokeswoman <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> served eight years of a 14-year sentence in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker, chopping off her forearms with an ax and leaving her for dead in a ditch near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in 1978. He finished parole in April and recently moved back to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> where he has family. He grew up in the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> registered with state authorities Monday to comply with <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law that any felon moving into the state must list his address. He gave his brother <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>'s address in the <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> area. When they found out <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was their neighbor, residents of the quiet, middle-class area said they were angry and afraid. More than 40 of them met Wednesday night and started a petition drive demanding that he move out. `` We are being asked to change our life styles because of one lunatic,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sells </PERSON>, 42. Several residents said they would no longer allow their children to go out alone. One resident said, however, that <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s relatives said <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> is n't living in <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, but is using his brother's address while living 2 -LCB- hours away from <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> Some residents expressed fears not only of <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, but also of misguided vigilantism. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Heitlinger </PERSON>, 66, has a gray beard _ as does <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. `` Anybody with a gray beard that walks by is a suspect,'' he said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials seeking to place <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> during his parole were met by community protests, and local law enforcement officials said they feared they could not guarantee his safety. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> finally served his parole time while living in a mobile home within the gates of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> state prison.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel voted Thursday to slash spending for the space station to $ 200 million, a move officials said will strangle the program unless the appropriation is increased dramatically. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had requested $ 967 million for the space station in the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Officials say at least $ 900 million is needed to keep the space station on schedule for a completion in the late 1990s. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said $ 200 million `` provides only enough for the slow strangulation of the space station'' and that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s personal intervention will be needed to rescue the program. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said he would ask <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto the spending bill that includes funds for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> if not enough money is set aside to sustain the space station. The <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> money is part of a spending bill that also includes funds for the Veterans Administration, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies. `` I am hopeful that we may yet in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> do something to correct this situation, but it is an uphill battle,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version of the space station bill earlier this week, `` totally irresponsible.'' `` In this election year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is clearly looking at the next election and not the next generation,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee's space station bill calls on the next administration to review the project in January and if the new president wants it to continue, he would have to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for additional funds. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has estimated the project could cost more than $ 20 billion to complete. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version, the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted this week to spend $ 387 million on research and development on the space station. Another $ 65.4 million would be held in an account, and should the next president decide not to continue with the program, those funds would be used to shut down the program. Additionally, $ 450 million would be held through April 15. If the president decides to continue with the program, the money would go to the space station. If not, $ 150 million would be transferred to space flight control and data communications at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, and the remaining $ 300 million would be rescinded. `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approach _ to fence part of money and wait to see if new president wants to have a viable space program _ is passing the buck, to say the least,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. `` Our problem clearly is that there are other programs with large numbers of constitutents more appealing politically than programs such as space and science. And we've been seeing this over and over for the last three years,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said construction of the space station could begin next year if it stays on schedule. The space station is planned to be in orbit around <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and occupied by astronauts by the end of 1996.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that rebels attacked a military unit in violation of a cease-fire and kidnapped six civilians. A ministry statement said two soldiers were killed and three wounded when rebels ambushed three Sandinista army trucks in northern <LOCATION> Jinotega </LOCATION> province Wednesday. It said six civilians were kidnapped in various parts of the country. The U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras, and the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government agreed to suspend offensive military operations on March 21, when talks began which led to an agreement to seek a definitive cease-fire in the civil war. The two sides have made little progress since then. The Contras have accused the Sandinistas of violating the truce. Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused the rebels of `` flagrant violations of the cease-fire'' in a letter sent Thursday to <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, the archbishop of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> and <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> served as witnesses to the Sandinista-Contra peace talks and are responsible for verifying the cease-fire accords. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, brother of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and head of the government negotiating team, also noted that <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> leaders were seeking renewed military aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in violation of the agreements. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a member of the Contra directorate, told reporters Thursday the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration agreed to seek a new aid package for the rebels, who have been fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> for six years. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> and <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo to investigate the civilian kidnappings. The government claims the Contras have kidnapped more than 1,000 Nicaraguans. The rebels have acknowledged holding 66. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also criticized a rebel proposal to include President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> in future peace talks. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> received the Nobel Peace Prize last year for being the author of a regional peace plan signed by five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents last August.

<HEAD>Five Detained by Police in Rallies Marking Execution of Revolt
Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police detained five Hungarian dissidents Thursday on charges they chanted anti-government slogans and incited a crowd in rallies marking the execution of leaders of the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt. Witnesses said the five, all known as leading dissidents in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, gathered in a downtown square and chanted, `` Democracy'' and `` Nagy'' after a peaceful morning vigil at the unmarked graves where <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, a leader of the 1956 revolt, and associates are believed buried. The ceremonies marked 30 years since the official media published a <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> decree on June 17, 1958, announcing the four were sentenced to death for having `` played a leading role in the preparation and starting of the counter-revolutionary uprising in October 1956.'' Calls for <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s rehabilitation and that of some of his associates have become increasingly frequent. The 1956 revolt began Oct. 23 with mass demonstrations for a new government and demands that Soviet troops leave <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. But 200,000 Soviet troops and 2,500 tanks struck <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> Nov. 4 to quell the uprising. The official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency said in a terse report that `` a group of persons who had been active in the 1956 events'' gathered in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> despite a police warning. The report said the men then `` tried to bring under their influence a crowd of about 350 to 400 persons whom they had mobilized.'' `` Police took the necessary steps to ensure public order. In the course of this, <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Racz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> Demszky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roza </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodosan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jenoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Egetoe </PERSON> were taken to the police station,'' the report said. Witnesses said a group of about 20 or 30 people laid flowers in mid-afternoon at the eternal flame to a Hungarian premier executed in the abortive 1848 revolution against <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and stepped back into a crowd of about 400 people who had gathered. About 150 police guarded the square and conducted frequent identity checks, the witnesses said. One witness said police charged onlookers who tried to approach the flame. After a half-hour, the crowd moved towards the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> river and then on to the nearby Hungarian television station, the witnesses said. There, dissident <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiss </PERSON> addressed the crowd but a witness said the speech was drowned out by crowd chants of `` AVO'' to the waiting police. The AVO was the dreaded secret police in the 1950s. The witness said riot police then moved in to break the crowd. It was not immediately clear if anybody was injured. A reporter for Austrian radio said Thursday's vigil at what is believed to be <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s unmarked grave drew at least 250 people. The area was scattered with crosses, candles, flowers and small <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> flags. A list of names of those executed after the 1956 uprising was read and an unidentified speaker called for their rehabilitation and proper graves for them, a witness said. Rehabilitation would likely require approval not only from the Hunagrian Communist party but also from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which is thought to have played a key role in ordering <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s execution. There was no official Hungarian report on either of Thursday's events, which were announced last week by a 37-member committee calling itself `` Let Justice Prevail'' and including <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s daughter,

<HEAD>Immigration Service Denying Parole To Hundreds of Cubans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal officials said Thursday they are denying parole to about 970 imprisoned Cubans, each of whom will be notified individually of the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said that while more than 1,500 detainees have been released since Cubans rioted at two federal prisons last November, these are the first notices of denied parole to be issued. Detainees may appeal the denial of parole to a review panel at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Detainees being denied parole are being notified by administrators at the federal institutions where they are incarcerated, and each prison is using its own judgment on whether to take special security precautions, <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said. The detainees were among 125,000 Cubans sent to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in the 1980 `` freedom flotilla'' boatlift from the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION>. Most committed crimes following their arrival in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, served their sentences and were held by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> for deportation to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which refused to accept them. Federal prisons in <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> erupted in riots last November after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had agreed to take back about 2,500 refugees considered undesirable by this country. The rioting involved the taking of 138 prison employee hostages and the death of one detainee. The government estimated the 1,394 inmates at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and 987 at <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> destroyed $ 64.4 million in prison property and that it cost $ 48.9 million to quiet the disturbances and relocate the Cubans. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report on the riots concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> gave too little notice of the deportation agreement and prison employees failed to report early signs of trouble.

<HEAD>Rumor of Sale of Landmark Cafe in Madrid Causes Stir</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD LORANT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rumors the Gran Cafe de Gijon in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> might be sold to a British bank rattled coffee cups far beyond the century-old literary landmark once frequented by the likes of <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> and <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Capote </PERSON>. Legend has it that the actress <PERSON> Ava </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> once punched a photographer there. When the rumors spread recently of its possible sale, major publications rushed into print with what they called the inside story. Mayor <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barranco </PERSON> pledged to preserve the cafe. Part-owner <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Brito </PERSON> spent a week denying it was for sale. `` We are not selling. It is impossible,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> told reporters the day reports came out that an British multinational bank, not identified, had made a $ 5-million bid for the cafe that first opened its doors in 1888. Although it was before noon, the Gijon was already thick with cigar and cigarette smoke, and most of its marble-top tables were filled. The Gijon stands just off <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s traffic-clogged main thoroughfare, the <ORGANIZATION> Paseo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castellana </ORGANIZATION>, as a reminder of quieter days when cafes stretched across the city and coffee time was a ritual. Although its glory days are past and <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> is much busier in an economic boom, the Gijon still attracts dozens of `` tertulias,'' groups of intellectuals, artists or retirees who meet once or twice a week for relaxed conversation with a cigar over coffee and brandy. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Brito </PERSON> said accepting the unidentified British bank's offer would have broken a pledge made to his grandmother, <PERSON> Encarnation </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who bought the cafe from its original owners in 1913 `` Before my grandmother died, she made my father and my aunt promise not to sell. As long as my aunt is alive we would n't even consider it,'' said <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Brito </PERSON>, who owns the cafe with his four cousins. `` After that, who knows?'' he said. `` The younger generation all have professional careers. They want their free time. The cafe does n't allow that.'' Grandmother <PERSON> Encarnacion </PERSON> and her daughter, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, presided over the Gijon in the years after the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War, when struggling actors and writers were drawn to cafes because of their central heating and cheap admission _ the price of a tiny cup of coffee. By the time grateful artists showered <PERSON> Encarnacion </PERSON> with drawings and verse on her 100th birthday in 1968, most of them were eating better, and the Gijon was a grand old survivor, its fame cemented by the gradual demise of most competitors. `` The majority of the cafes were converted into bank branches, and the literary people took refuge here because there were n't many places left, `` said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, who began working at the Gijon in 1950. `` The coffee hour was a bit sacred,'' he said. `` People would talk about their projects, about bullfights. They generally avoided politics'' during <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s 36-year rule. <PERSON> Pilar </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nombrela </PERSON>, who has lived above the cafe for 20 years, said the Gijon in the late 1960s `` was a classic cafe.'' `` People would spend three hours over a cup of coffee and talk about art and literature. There were tables and tables of famous people. It was incredible.'' Today, the `` tertulias'' are fewer. At nights, the cafe is filled with young Spaniards who prefer gin-tonics to brandy. An armed guard stands inside the door to keep out heroin addicts who have occasionally robbed patrons at knife point. Gentifrication has set in the neighborhood around the cafe and real estate values have shot up like the skyscrapers along the <LOCATION> Castellana </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> economy marks an annual 5.2 percent growth rate. `` The cafe has changed a lot, just like the country has changed,'' the 63-year-old <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. `` In those days, there were 20 cars circulating in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. Horse-drawn carriages were used a lot. People worked less and had more time.'' `` <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> was a city of cafes,'' he said. `` One writer called it an archipelago of tertulias.'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, an octogenarian who has met at the Gijon to chat with fellow <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> retirees for the last two decades, does not miss those times. `` The bureacrats used to spend all day in the cafes,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said, a few minutes before initiating a debate on the merits of legalizing hard drugs. `` When they finally got to the office, all they did was talk about what they had done in the cafe.''

 The synthesizer sounds just like an accordion as the band swings into a traditional polka rhythm. Young women on stage swirl and stomp in step to the music, singing along in Polish. But the women are in miniskirts, the lead singer wears a leather jacket and the song they sing is not exactly standard polka: `` I went out Friday night with you know who _ that babcid with the size 12 bowling shoe. She feeds me kielbasa and makes me drink that wine. And then she likes to dance that Love Polka Number Nine.'' Irreverent? You bet. Offensive? Not to the people on the crowded dance floor bopping to the beat of The Polish Muslims as they do their version of the 1959 Clovers hit, `` Love Potion No. 9.'' For six years the group has tried to break into the big time while building a following as one of the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area's most popular bar bands. They like to blend standards, chiefly the dance tunes that put Motown on the map, with parodies celebrating life among Poles. But at the same time, they retain the music and spirit of the songs. `` Respect,'' `` Nowhere to Run,'' `` Rescue Me,'' `` Come See About Me'' and `` <PERSON> Doo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wah </PERSON> <PERSON> Diddy </PERSON>'' sound like live versions of the originals. `` It's all for fun,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Uchalik </PERSON>, the eight-member band's 33-year-old lead singer `` We want to come across as a cross between Poison and <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankovich </PERSON>.'' Not so, says guitarist <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kondrat </PERSON>: `` We're like ` Weird <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankovic </PERSON>' with talent.'' The Polish Muslims' version of the 1963 Beach Boys hit, `` <LOCATION> Surfing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>,'' is `` Bowling U.S.A.'' The lyrics, revised to laud the popular sport, mention the two-story alley that served as an inadvertent backdrop to <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s outdoor service here last fall. `` If everybody had a bowling ball across the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, then everybody'd be bowling like at <LOCATION> Playdium </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanes </LOCATION>. They'd all be bringing their rosin bags and their numbered shoes...'' They shuffle lyrics to make room for Polish phrases and references to pirogi, kielbasa, bowling, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> _ a little bit of everything. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>'s `` Let's Go Crazy'' became `` Let's Golambki'' _ a tribute to stuffed cabbage rolls. Where an original hit climaxes with a wailing guitar solo, the band will insert a riff from `` Peanut Polka'' or some other polka classic. `` Our humor does n't go over anyone's head. We try to stare right about eye-level _ nothing too subtle or forget it,'' said <PERSON> Kondrat </PERSON>, 30, who like six others in the band is a Catholic of Polish descent. In honor of the Polish pontiff, the Beatles' `` Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da'' was rewritten as `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Two </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> One </PERSON>,'' and <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s `` Travelin' Man'' became `` Travelin' Pope.'' Their blend of rock and polka puts The Polish Muslims into a tiny musical subset, according to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> record producer <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Goudie </PERSON>. `` The Polish Muslims are one of eight bands in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that is playing rock polka or punk polka,'' said <PERSON> Goudie </PERSON>, who sought out the bands for `` Polka Is Now,'' a sampler LP to be released Oct. 7 by <ORGANIZATION> Restless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Goudie </PERSON> identified the genre's leading group as Brave Combo, which works out of <LOCATION> Denton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and treats polka rock much more seriously than do the Muslims. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has the 20-piece Polka Side; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> a group called <PERSON> Rotondi </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> boasts The Wallets; <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holes </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, The Romaniacs; and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is home to the all-female polka punk band <PERSON> Das </PERSON> <PERSON> Furlines </PERSON>, whose leader goes by the name <PERSON> Deb </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Nair </PERSON>. `` All these bands play for rock audiences,'' <PERSON> Goudie </PERSON> said. `` They do rock clubs and punk clubs and weirdo gigs.'' The most successful bands create original music layered on a polka base, <PERSON> Goudie </PERSON> said. `` The Muslims' ` Bowling U.S.A.' is a godhead, but as cool as those little covers are, they ca n't make money off them,'' he said. `` They need original material.'' The problem, he said, is that the original composer collects the profits when a parody becomes a hit. Of course, that's if the music publisher gives permission for the parody in the first place. `` Bowling U.S.A.,'' to the tune of `` Surfin' <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>,'' which itself was to the tune of `` Sweet Little Sixteen,'' got the thumbs-down from <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s publishing company, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who owns the rights to `` Dance to the Music,'' would n't let the Muslims record `` Dance to the Polka,'' <PERSON> Uchalik </PERSON> said They got away with recording `` Love Polka Number Nine'' only because the publishing house failed to answer two letters, he said. That record was a self-produced, self-distributed single. It was followed up by `` A Yuletide Rock Opera,'' in which the <LOCATION> Gloria </LOCATION> chorus of `` Angels We Have Heard on High'' got a heavy bass line and the word yelled out, letter by letter: `` G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria!'' For <PERSON> Goudie </PERSON>'s compilation, the group wrote an original song: `` That's Why God Invented the Polka.'' It will be their first national exposure. But if the record does n't catch on, the Muslims will still be packing them in at Paycheck's Lounge. `` There are a lot of real good bands around town that you go to see and you know they're not making gas money,'' drummer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` We have n't had problems booking anywhere, knock on formica.''

 The little girl is so delighted, she cries out periodically to nobody in particular, `` I'm walkin' with a cane!'' In <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>'s documentary, `` Deaf and <PERSON> Blind </PERSON>,'' viewers go right along with the girl on her first lesson with the cane as her teacher helps her negotiate stairways, identify corridors and search out the cause of a mysterious noise _ a water fountain. The four-part series begins tonight on PBS with the first two-hour installment, `` Blind.'' <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> is probably best-known for his 1967 documentary on the State Prison for the Criminally Insane in <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Unlike that ground-breaking film, `` Deaf and Blind'' is no expose. It is set at the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> for the Deaf and <PERSON> Blind </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, a leading educator of the handicapped. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>'s cinema-verite style provides an up-close look at what life is like for students and teachers at the institute. It would be difficult for anyone who sees the film to look at a deaf, blind or multi-handicapped person the same way again. `` Deaf and Blind'' airs in four parts, each about two hours long: `` Blind'' tonight, `` Deaf'' on Saturday, `` Multi-Handicapped'' on June 24, and `` Adjustment and Work'' June 25. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> has made 20 films about American institutions, including the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a police department, Belmont racetrack and the <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> department store. He is fascinated by the intricacies of institutions, and he turns the camera _ operated by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> _ on classrooms, field trips, counseling sessions and staff meetings at the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> school. There is no narration and little editing, and the subjects of the filming seem unaffected by the camera's presence. With little interruption and no outside explanation, the films can get tedious. But, as <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> says in his production notes, `` by placing an audience in the midst of the enormous complexities of this other world of the disabled, -LRB- the films -RRB- attempt to convey some of the feeling, experiences and attitudes of blind and deaf people toward their lives.'' In the opening of `` Blind,'' <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>'s camera follows the school's blind band to an appearance at a local stock-car race. This segment of the documentary is a profound little film in itself. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> captures the sights and sounds of the racetrack and intersperses them with highly detailed images of the young people in their band uniforms gingerly feeling their way out of the schoolbus, gathering in a little group in the infield while high-performance race cars whiz by on the track. At the institute, <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> starts with the youngest children first. On the playground, an elementary school girl goes down a slide. Without comment, <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> captures her courage, feet dangling for a beat before she lets go, confidently sliding off into the unknown. In another segment, concerned teachers confer about a difficult student. Here, as often in the films, <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> conveys a sense of community and caring among the teachers and administrators of the school. The films also reveal that many of the problems handicapped youngsters have are no different from anyone else's. In `` Deaf,'' for instance, a student's mother has made the long drive to <ORGANIZATION> Talladega </ORGANIZATION> from Mobile to meet with a counselor concerned about her son's displays of anger. After a long discussion, the son finally reveals he is frustrated at not seeing his estranged father. `` He does not love you,'' his mother tells him with the help of rudimentary sign language. The boy looks at the floor. She tries to reassure him that his stepfather does love him, and he eventually hugs her and promises to try to behave better. In another segment, young deaf students on a field trip to a jail are startled when a man in a cell begins signing to them. They sign among themselves, then begin signing back to the man. It is times like these when narration would be helpful, because viewers without sign language skills are shut out of the silent conversation. But then that itself is an educational turning of the tables.

 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deaf </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Blind </PERSON> hopes a four-part documentary by filmmaker <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> will inspire change to benefit the handicapped everywhere. `` I think it will sensitize many Americans to the uniqueness of the disabled, the frustrations and challenges of the deaf and blind,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, president of the institute. `` Over the longer term,'' he said, `` the film may make a major contribution in the professional perception of those who choose to work in these fields.'' The series, which has been seen only at film festivals and at theaters in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area, reaches a national audience for the first time tonight with the opening installment, `` Blind,'' on public television. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>'s stark look inside a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> mental hospital two decades ago helped transform the care of the nation's mentally ill. This look inside the institute at <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION> is part of a series of documentaries on American institutions. When he told a friend he wanted to do a film on the disabled as part of that series, <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> explained in a telephone interview, he was told the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> institute was `` one of the best schools in the country.'' He filmed for about six weeks at the <ORGANIZATION> Talladega </ORGANIZATION> complex, which was founded in 1858 and has grown into a multi-purpose program that provides kindergarten through 12th-grade academics, competitive athletics, vocational training as well as special skills training for the deaf, blind and multi-handicapped of all ages. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said he received `` complete cooperation'' from the institute and its staff as his camera recorded the anguishing difficulties and daily personal heroism of the handicapped and their teachers. `` I was impressed by the kindness and compassion,'' said <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>. In 1967, <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>'s film `` Titicut Follies'' reported graphically on the degrading living conditions and dehumanizing treatment of the mentally ill at a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state hospital. The widely acclaimed film helped draw attention to what amounted to a national problem as litigation to reform mental health care spread to many states, including <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> disagees with those who view his work as cause-oriented filming aiming only to expose one problem or another. `` I think that was a bum rap,'' said <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>. `` I report on the experience I had in making the film.'' He said `` Titicut Follies'' turned out to be `` quite extreme.'' In contrast, he said, the experience at the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> institute was good. `` I report on what I find,'' he said. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said he was not aware of the controversial nature of `` Titicut Follies'' when he opened the doors of the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> institute to <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>. But even after learning about the filmmaker's previous work, he said, `` we felt comfortable that our program could withstand his scrutiny. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> and his crew seemed to become part of the normal environment. `` They were the most unassuming, unintrusive and unimposing people I've ever seen,'' he said. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> `` recorded the human drama and the boredom of life itself,'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said. `` He did a great job of capturing what deafness and blindness are all about. We just happened to be the vehicle for him to use.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cable TV has laudably provided a much-needed outlet for talented comedy writers who would otherwise have to wait for a rare network television job or big movie deal to get their work before much of the public. But in doing so, cable has also created a new genre _ comedy you would n't actually pay money for but do n't mind watching when there's absolutely nothing else on. Two samples of the mediocre are available this month on Cinemax and Showtime. On Tuesday night, <PERSON> Cinemax </PERSON> has `` Cinemax Comedy Experiment: <PERSON> Teri </PERSON> <PERSON> Garr </PERSON> in Flapjack Floozie.'' It also airs June 23, 26 and 29. On Wednesday, three up-and-coming comedians do their standup routines on <PERSON> Showtime </PERSON>'s `` Funnymen: Triple Clowns of Comedy'' with <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> as host. It can also be seen June 26, 28 and July 1 and 7. The three work an easy room, a good-natured suburban crowd in the Civic Theatre in <LOCATION> Hermosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. At one point they are so moved by the material, they give a standing ovation to the closing act, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, who bounds onstage with his guitar, is a facile musician and impressionist who almost achieves a <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> level of insanity, but ends up playing it safe with tired material, doing Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Fudd </PERSON> impressions and setting amusing lyrics to well-known tunes _ `` Fever'' becomes an ode to `` Leave It to Beaver.'' His one-man impersonation of The Who in concert is rather impressive, though. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumatai </PERSON>, a Hawaiian, also relies on tried-and-true material _ ethnic jokes. He says he is enjoying <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` It's fun being Mexican. ... I ca n't wait to get to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. I understand there I'll be Puerto Rican.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein-like </PERSON> comic who has appeared on `` The Tonight Show,'' suffers from slow timing, but his epic joke about the `` five levels of drinking _ six if you live in a trailer park'' is worth the wait. For instance, by level four, he says, you're saying to yourself, `` As long as I'm only going to get a few hours of sleep _ I might as well stay up all night! It's good for me. I do n't mind going to that board meeting looking like <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>.'' Between acts, <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> offers excruciatingly long, lame jokes that show why he is a successful actor, not a comedian. `` Flapjack Floozie'' on <ORGANIZATION> Cinemax </ORGANIZATION> is a confusing hodge-podge of takeoffs, spoofing the obscure musical melodrama genre as well as the more contemporary spate of celebrity addiction confessions. It was co-written and directed by former `` Saturday Night Live'' contributor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiller </PERSON>, who once wrote a short for SNL called `` Java Junkie.'' The <PERSON> Cinemax </PERSON> film is an `` SNL'' sketch stretched beyond its limits. To be fair, these `` comedy experiments'' are very low-budget, and you apparently get what you pay for. <PERSON> Garr </PERSON>, one of the best comedic actresses around, is no match for the silly material. She plays <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagles </PERSON>, a singer who grew up in vaudeville and somehow got hooked on pancakes as a result. A few months ago, <PERSON> Garr </PERSON> was saying that she and <PERSON> Schiller </PERSON> were working up a comedy short about a woman addicted to sugar. Apparently they decided pancakes were funnier. They were wrong. Flapjacks take over <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>'s life after she falls for a gangster -LRB- played by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON>, brother of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> -RRB-, who opens the club <PERSON> Copacapancake </PERSON> as a showcase for <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>. After he is gunned down by a rival mobster, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> buries herself in shortstacks, until she is committed to the <ORGANIZATION> IHOP </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatry </ORGANIZATION> _ where a sympathetic doctor -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Standing </PERSON> -RRB- attempts to cure her. Eventually she's released into the custody of her childhood nanny -LRB- <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> -RRB-, who has become <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jemima </PERSON>. But on the plane on the way to her comeback in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> succumbs to her lingering addiction and suffers disfigurement in a bizarre pancake accident. `` Flapjack Floozie'' also stars <PERSON> Laraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Efron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> and was filmed at the <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, an old vaudeville theater in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The theater has surely seen better.

 The bull market of 1982-87 brought lush growth to the mutual fund industry, creating many new exotic varieties of funds. Now, say some critical observers, it may be time for some weeding out. It was only natural that fund managers would respond to an investment boom by trying to offer eye-catching new products. But in so doing, many observers say, they created a lot of confusion about what funds ought to do and are capable of doing. Both managers and investors strayed from the basics on which the concept of a mutual fund is founded _ investment for the long term in a diversified portfolio. And even some of the new ideas that looked most sensible and appealing on paper turned out to be ill-conceived. In the current issue of his <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Babson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Report </ORGANIZATION>, veteran financial adviser <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> reports that he recently participated in an industry panel discussion on the subject: `` Where have all the customers gone.'' `` My answer was twofold,'' he said. `` First, whenever the market takes a tumble as it did last fall, the customers always vanish. But eventually they come back. `` Second, and more important, mutual fund buyers have been sold on promises that ca n't be met. Performance is the name of the game these days, and a performance so short term that it is invariably illusory. `` Good investors are lucky enough if they can stay even with the market. But the fund industry in its offerings leads to the belief that the market can be beaten, whether in performance or in income or both. `` Thus, investors tend to be sold the fund whose recent performance is outstanding, rather than the one which has temporarily lagged. They end up buying high and selling low. `` The industry, again in the name of performance, encourages people to try all sorts of investment gimmickry _ options, financial futures, junk bonds, sector funds, asset allocation schemes and the like _ in an attempt to ` beat the market.' `` Such funds are tough to win with unless one has the investment skills of a Houdini. Most of us do not.'' As a case in point of an inventive idea gone wrong, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> brokerage firm of <ORGANIZATION> Sutro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> cited the group known as option-income funds. In theory, there were good results to be had in putting together a portfolio of investments and enhancing the income on the investments by selling options on them. But in 10 years of actual practice, in a wide variety of market environments, a composite of five option-income funds has consistently lagged far behind <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock composite index, Sutro analysts note. `` The total-return performance, which, after all, is where it has to pay off sooner or later, has never lived up to its early promise,'' said <PERSON> Sutro </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McIver </PERSON>. `` In our opinion, the concept has been given more than enough time to ` work' and it's time to admit that the big mutual fund format is incompatible with the optimum performance of an option income strategy.'' In <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON>'s view, `` The funds would be better off, we all would be, if investors were simply encouraged to buy diversified common stock funds, with only enough bonds to sweeten the current return where necessary. `` Then they could ride gradually but almost surely to success in the stock market and have lots left over to leave to their grandchildren.''

 Silver and turquoise jewelry adorn <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON>'s tiny hands, and Indian images hang in the small house across from a shopping mall far from the red stone and open sky of her <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> reservation. One of the rings is a gift from a Navajo elder at a recent powwow that 11-month-old <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> visited with <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>, who have been trying to adopt her since her birth. The custody case has split the Navajo Nation. Many in the tribe sympathized, but others vilified the <LOCATION> Pittses </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> mother, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>, who moved in with the couple when she was pregnant and still lives with them. A tribal court granted the Pittses temporary custody of <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> in April and is considering whether to grant permanent guardianship. A 1978 federal law gives tribal courts jurisdiction in adoption cases of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> children as a way of preserving the heritage of the tribes. `` I believe in the old traditional ways,'' the elder told the Pittses. `` But seeing you, knowing how much you love that baby, you deserve her.'' Oblivious of the legal tangle, <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> plays happily, a child with two mothers and two cultures. She has been blessed by a Navajo medicine man and a pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Rather than the earthen-walled hogans and trailer homes that dot the hot, dry reservation, wood frame and stucco houses line the streets in the Pittses' busy <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` I think she'll have a better understanding of both worlds,'' said <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>, who with his wife agreed to take <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> back to the reservation frequently as she grows up and to have her learn Navajo ways. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>, 21 and unmarried, is working as a supermarket cashier but has applied to join the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and says she's eager to start a new life. The custody fight with her tribe, she says, has been `` like an explosion in my face.'' <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>, who has lived away from the reservation most of her life under a <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> education program, says tribal officials have criticized her but many Navajos have been supportive. She plans to see her daughter regularly, and Mrs. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> says it's all right with her if <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> calls them both `` Mom.'' <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> met the Pittses through an ad placed by adoption attorneys in a Navajo newspaper. The ad read, `` Pregnant? We're willing to help you. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> wrote to the attorneys, saying she wanted to give her baby to a family that would provide a good home and education off the reservation. About a week later, the Pittses contacted the same attorneys about their desire to adopt a baby after Mrs. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> had three miscarriages trying to have a second child and then had a hysterectomy. The birth and <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>'s immediate release of <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> to the Pittses went smoothly, until the tribe intervened. Following terms of the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, they notified the tribe that the adoption was pending in a non-Indian <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> court. In February, the tribe sought custody. The Pittses feared they might have lost <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> forever when tribal officials took her away to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> in April. The couple had given her up at the airport in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> on orders from a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge who ruled Indian courts had jurisdiction. <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> cried as the officials walked away with her and kept her separated from Mrs. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> as they flew to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> on the same plane. From there, they expected to fly with <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> and the officials to <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION>. Instead, the Navajos drove off to the stark, 14-million-acre reservation in northeastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, leaving Mrs. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> frantic about <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON>'s welfare. `` I thought giving up the baby was hard, but when the tribe intervened that was the hardest, especially when they ran off with <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> says. `` They said I brought shame on the Navajo nation. But I am ashamed at how they mistreated her.'' When the Pittses and <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> next saw <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> three days later, they say she was filthy and running a fever. Child-psychologist <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodfield </PERSON> said she also was reacting in a way that reflected stress and fear. `` She'd always been a happy-go-lucky baby, and anybody could hold her,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said. `` After they took her, she would only allow me to hold her for quite some time.'' She added, `` She's pretty much back to normal now,'' and <PERSON> Goodfield </PERSON> agreed. <PERSON> Anslem </PERSON> <PERSON> Roanhorse </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>, denied <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> was neglected or mistreated in her stay with Indian officials. He said the baby was taken first to a hospital for an evaluation and to obtain medication for asthma, then was put in the care of an experienced foster parent. `` We know for a fact that she was not neglected,'' <PERSON> Roanhorse </PERSON> said. The Pittses owe $ 13,000 in lawyers' fees. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>, an independent building contractor, lost more than $ 10,000 in income while fighting to keep <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON>. Several Hollywood studios have shown interest in the story, but no deals have been signed. In another month or so, perhaps by <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON>'s first birthday on July 20, the Pittses hope the tribal court will approve their permanent guardianship petition. Even then, <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think the experience we went through, the emotions it stirred up, will ever be over. `` We'll always be reminded of it because we're always going to campaign against this law, as long as it's being enforced the way it is, to help anyone else who falls into this unfortunate situation.'' The Indian Child Welfare Act was part of an effort to stop the exodus of thousands of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> children _ as many as 35 percent of some tribes' youngsters _ to non-Indian homes after their parents' rights were terminated by non-Indian courts Welfare agencies, using a non-Indian set of cultural values, often found fault with Indian child-rearing practices or assumed life off the reservation would be better. <PERSON> Roanhorse </PERSON> compared Indians to endangered species, saying their future was threatened by the loss of children. The Pittses and Keetso do n't disagree with the reasons behind the Indian Child Welfare Act. But they criticize the way Indian officials handled their case. `` I believe they were sincere in their concerns about their heritage and culture, and we share their concerns,'' <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said. `` It was our original arrangement with <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> that she'd be able to see <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> all she wants and we'd take <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> out to visit <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>'s family on the reservation,'' he said. `` That's the same thing the tribal court said it wanted. If the Indian welfare people had bothered to ask before they went to court, they'd have spared all of us a lot of pain.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cardinals meet this month to renew debate over what to teach Catholics about AIDS. But if the struggles of a trailblazing religious education director in an affluent <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> parish are any indication, the debate goes deeper than the much-publicized condom furor. AIDS is shaking ordinary parishioners' deepest religious convictions and raising a central question: is the church fundamentally about love or judgment?

 <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> _ nurse, hospital chaplain, mother of five and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educator _ once wrote a verse about trying to teach her unusual gospel of AIDS in this affluent <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. `` Behold, `` The empty chairs and `` the quickened pace to run. `` Away from me who waits to `` Reveal love over judgment, `` Knowledge over ignorance, `` Healing through reconciliation. `` AIDS ministers embrace an EXILED station. `` Behold, the empty chairs.'' For six years, Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> has been director of religious education at <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, a church set on 11 acres of lush lawns and generous parking lots. To most in <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION>, AIDS is as vague and distant as a foreign war on the evening news. But in 1986, a friend of Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> revealed his homosexuality and began drinking heavily because he feared getting AIDS. Later, she heard from some parents that their children were trying `` alternative life-styles,'' including homosexuality. Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> came to believe that this conservative, sheltered parish could no longer ignore the disease. She spent 16 months writing an AIDS curriculum expressly for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> parents, `` From Fr-AIDS to Faith: Let Us Talk About AIDS.'' Told in story form, blending gospel with realism about sex, drugs and AIDS, it was designed to help parents explain the disease to their children. For fourth - through sixth-graders, for example, there is a graphic discussion of bodily fluids, how AIDS is and is not spread, sex and marriage Suddenly this past school year, sleepy suburban <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION> found itself an improbable beacon of AIDS education. Her parish priest, Sunday school teachers and parents use words like `` pioneer,'' `` visionary,'' even `` prophet,'' to describe Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON>, who argues that AIDS is a cataclysmic ethical and medical event that raises centuries-old questions over whether the essence of Roman Catholicism is love or judgment. Despite the outward adulation, however, her AIDS gospel has been largely ignored. She sent her curriculum to about 400 families in her parish, but only three accepted her offer for discussions. `` Our homophobia is making us deny that the disease belongs to all of us,'' she said. She got brief national attention when she spoke about her curriculum at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in April She was subsequently invited to address other Chicago-area parishes, but attracted only tiny audiences. The problems she and fellow teachers have found within the church, in some ways as intractable as the HIV virus itself, are denial and indifference among parishioners and ambiguity and division in church policy. This month, she decided to leave her parish post to devote all her time to AIDS missionary work. The story of what happened when <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> tried to get AIDS discussed in <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION> tells much about the confusion and moral contradictions the disease presents for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educators everywhere. `` AIDS,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON>, echoing the sentiments of many church members, `` is creating havoc for the Catholic church.'' In one sense, her parish was fertile ground for trailblazing. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> archdiocese, led by Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON>, is comparatively liberal. Last December, when <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops issued a landmark statement on AIDS education that included mention of condoms, <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> was a chief proponent. The statement drew fire from traditionalists led by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. The nation's 300 bishops have agreed to meet in <LOCATION> Collegeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, June 24-27 to discuss the issue again. Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON>, though often critical of what she considers the church's lack of realism about AIDS, never ran afoul of the archdiocese. Sister <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> archdiocese, and others in the hierarchy have praised her and her curriculum. Her pronouncements have sometimes challenged the bounds of acceptable dogma, as when she told a gathering of nuns, priests and lay religious teachers at the convention: `` If a kid tells me he's sexually active, I give condom information I'll tell him how to put it on.''

 The heart of her AIDS message, however, is not condoms but the Good Samaritan parable, <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> 10:25 -37, directing Christians not to judge their suffering neighbors but to care for them `` Let God do the judging,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION> parishioners were getting mixed signals from their pastor. Father <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Herne </PERSON>, who has generally supported Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON>' AIDS mission and who agrees the church should be compassionate, says it nevertheless should not shrink from calling a sin a sin. <PERSON> Herne </PERSON> wrote some verse of his own in a church bulletin: `` What used to be called chastity is now called neurotic inhibition ... What used to be called perversion is now called alternative lifestyle. What used to be called depravity is now called creative self-expression.'' `` She says God is love,'' <PERSON> Herne </PERSON> said of Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON>. `` I say amen to that. But everything people do is not OK.'' <PERSON> Herne </PERSON> said he agreed with Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> that the church should soften its finger-wagging image and the perception it does not welcome homosexuals who contract AIDS `` We're not against homosexuals,'' said <PERSON> Herne </PERSON>. `` But we seem to be on the moral side, and less on the compassionate and understanding side.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON>' work comes as <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educators scramble to devise lessons about AIDS. The <ORGANIZATION> NCEA </ORGANIZATION> has until August to complete an AIDS curriculum for parochial schools to use in the new school year. It is likely to discuss, but not condone, condom use. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> archdiocese devised its own AIDS curriculum, which will be introduced this fall. Led by Sister <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, the archdiocese enlisted experts from <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere to help train parochial teachers. Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> contends that <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educators hold an untapped advantage over public schools in their ability to imbue AIDS lessons with religion. `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> tells us a story in <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> that helps us know how to treat persons who are sick, especially persons with AIDS,'' says her curriculum, referring to the Good Samaritan story and using language that would be beyond constitutional bounds in public schools. In talking to children in her parish she discovered it was these matters of the heart that puzzled them most. `` They would ask me, ` Why does the school nurse wear rubber gloves now?' or ` What if somebody falls down at school and bleeds. Can I still help them?''' But to most <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION> youngsters, AIDS remains remote. `` I told my kids, ` When you go to college next year, how are you going to know who you're with?''' said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dondlinger </PERSON>, who teaches religious classes for teens at <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>. `` But the trouble is, AIDS is not here. The kids have a real hard time connecting to it.'' Did Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> really expect to succeed? `` It was n't a matter of whether I believed parents would use it,'' she said. `` I wanted to give them the tools. I feel much better that parents do the teaching.'' At least as worrisome as the laity's denial of AIDS, said Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON>, is the lack of thought toward moral and emotional preparation for parochial teachers being called upon to teach about AIDS. `` You're going to be giving a curriculum to a whole bunch of volunteer teachers who have n't thought out where they're coming from,'' she said. `` Not every educator should be doing this. If you do not have the heart for this, please be free enough not to do it. Students do n't want a one-shot filmstrip. `` Parents are hungry for a workable sexual theology. The hierarchy wants to do that, but they are writing from a male celibate perspective. That's not a criticism. That's a fact,'' she said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, who attended Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON>' AIDS lessons with his 10-year-old son, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, said he was glad of any help he could get in explaining AIDS and sexuality. `` It's good to have the Church involved in something like this,'' he said. `` I, like other parents, was hesitant to bring up AIDS with my kids,'' said another parent, <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> took a little pressure off us.'' How does Mrs. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> feel about the church as she prepares to leave her parish post? `` Love-hate. Sometimes it frustrates me,'' she said. `` The institution teaches me patience. It teaches me damage control. But I have hit an institutional wall not only in this parish, but in this church. `` On the AIDS issue, I needed the freedom to speak.''

 The leaders of the world's biggest industrial countries have much to be smug about as they gather here for their 14th annual summit. As a result, the meeting of the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is expected to be long on self-congratulation and short on new policy initiatives. The world economy is performing better than it has in years. Economic growth is accelerating, unemployment dropping and inflation remaining under control. With that kind of good news, there's a tendency to sweep aside troubling questions about still-huge trade imbalances, growing threats of protectionism and enormous Third World debt burdens. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who will be attending his eighth and final allied economic summit, said last week that he and the other heads of state should `` forget about quitting time'' and continue to push forward on several initiatives aimed at fostering global prosperity. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s colleagues ca n't forget that the president will be out of office in seven months and no longer able to carry out any deals he agrees to. Overhanging all of the discussions will be last October's worldwide stock market crash, which raised the specter of a global recession The market tumult followed a dispute between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over interest rates. The public tiff rattled financial markets as investors feared that joint international efforts to support the value of the dollar were coming unglued. With the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now forced to borrow between $ 10 billion and $ 15 billion a month from abroad to finance its trade and budget deficits, any weakness in the dollar threatens the foreign financing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has come to depend on. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies finally settled their policy differences with a new pledge last Dec. 22 to work closely to keep the dollar from declining further. Since that time the summit countries have gone out of their way to play down disputes and stress how well their drive toward closer economic cooperation is working. There are several successes that they will be able to point to. Foremost among them is this: Economic growth is far higher than economists were expecting in the wake of the stock market collapse. Six months ago the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> forecast the industrialized world would grow at a sluggish rate of 2.25 percent this year. Now the <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> is predicting world growth will come in at a respectable 3 percent. Virtually all of the summit nations have seen an acceleration in business activity. Trade imbalances, while still huge, have begun to narrow for the first time this decade. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which suffered a record high merchandise trade deficit of $ 170.3 billion last year, has seen that imbalance between exports and imports decline to an annual rate of $ 141.8 billion in the first four months of this year, prompting hope that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will be able to lower its trade deficit this year for the first time since 1980. Likewise, the trade surpluses in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the mirror image of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit, have begun to shrink, as both countries have been successful in boosting domestic demand to take the place of export-led growth. `` There are good numbers all over the place,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> economic consulting firm. `` The world economy is doing great so the prevailing mood at the summit will be why bother to change anything.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is doing all it can to play up the economic successes, planning to use the summit as a pulpit from which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> can preach one last time to other countries the free-market virtues of cutting tax rates, eliminating government regulations and turning state-run industries over to the private sector. In a pre-summit interview, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the administration's chief economic spokesman, said efforts he led in September 1985 for greater policy coordination among the seven summit countries had become firmly entrenched and should last beyond <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency. `` We have a coordination process that has been tested by the adversity of the stock market crash and shown to be effective and successful,'' he said. The main goal of that coordination effort has been to manage the decline of the dollar, from its heights three years ago, down to a level where it has rejuvenated American manufacturing. Since February, 1987, the summit countries have been striving to keep the dollar from going lower. That effort did not work last year as big waves of dollar selling periodically spread panic to stock and bond markets, culminating in the Oct. 19 crash. But after countries took the cooperation pledge again on Dec. 22 and backed up the words with massive joint intervention to buy dollars, the greenback's fall has been halted. Its value has been steady for the past six months, the longest period of stability of this decade. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will suggest making some minor improvements in the coordination process, including adding an index of various commodities including gold as a way the countries can use to judge whether their monetary policies are threatening to boost inflation. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> first introduced the commodity index proposal last September to less than enthusiastic response, but he has successfully lobbied for the plan as a way to add another benchmark to the indicator process that was launched at the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> summit in 1986. Third world debt will also be taken up, with the summit nations expected to announce a plan to relieve the poorest <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries of their debts. But the bigger question of how to handle the huge debt burdens of Latin American countries will likely be left untouched because of disagreements between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries over the proper approach to take. The summit leaders are also expected to tip-toe around the contentious trade question of agricultural subsidies. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a year ago at the <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> summit called for an end to all farm subsidies by the year 2000, but the Europeans oppose such a deadline even though the farm support programs are costing goverments $ 200 billion a year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hopes that the final economic communique will at least lend support to the current round of multilateral trade negotiations being conducted by the 96 member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

 A massive amount of confidential information was improperly funneled from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a search warrant issued in a nationwide investigation of possible <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracting corruption revealed Thursday. The search warrant said the government is investigating the `` bribery of public officials'' in connection with a scheme in which defense contractors got inside information from former government officials whom they had hired as consultants. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> declined to give a direct answer when asked if bribes had been accepted in the Pentagon. `` That will all come out in the course of the indictments and ultimately in the trials,'' he told reporters. The fraud and bribery investigation, involving the alleged sale of information to some of the nation's biggest defense contractors, drew attention all over <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` is very concerned'' about the revelations of the past few days, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said after a meeting that included the president, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> instructed them to move `` as rapidly as possible'' to get the facts. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said indictments may be handed down in 30 to 90 days. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the matter `` certainly poses an internal security problem.'' He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` feels that this is a matter that deserves his attention and that everyone involved should know of his feelings, the intensity which he feels about dealing with any kinds of crimes that have been committed here.'' Law enforcement sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said about 200 subpoenas had been served this week, some of them on major defense contractors other than the 15 companies and consultants whose offices had been searched Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, citing unidentified legal sources at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere, reported in Friday editions that the offices of at least three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members had been placed under investigation as part of the probe. The sources would not identify the lawmakers whose offices were involved or say who might face charges in the case, the lawmakers or their aides, the newspaper said. The search warrant that shed new light on the case was unsealed in federal court in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. It said <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who served from 1981 to April 1987 as assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for research, engineering and systems, a key acquisitions post, provided `` classified and-or confidential'' documents to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was a key associate of former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> now has numerous defense contractors as clients in his consulting business. Sources also said <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> is a consultant for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, whose <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offices were searched Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents as part of the fraud and bribery probe. The agents took away all documents in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>'s files relating to <LOCATION> Paisley </LOCATION>, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. The agents also took documents relating to the 404 and T-406 engines which <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>' subsidiary. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> began working as a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> consultant within a week after he left his <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> job last year, according to the sources. The warrant in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> authorized a search of the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> office of company executive <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> for `` inside information pertaining to'' the F-16 fighter plane manufactured by a competitor, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> is vice president for marketing at <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, which did $ 7.7 billion worth of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> business in fiscal 1987, making it the nation's largest defense contractor The fraud case _ culminating two year of undercover work and wiretaps of the offices of top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement officials _ started coming to light this week when federal investigators served search warrants on 15 companies and a half-dozen <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. Government sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, said the probe has involved court-authorized phone taps and bugs at <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s consulting office after he left the Pentagon. Evidence from the phone tap and the bug on <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> plus taps on the phones of two current <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, led investigators to the defense contractors and this week's widespread searches in 12 states. Sources told The Associated Press the taps on <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> were at their Pentagon offices. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that the court-authorized wiretaps lasted 290 days and overheard nearly 4,800 conversations, of which 671 were considered incriminating. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, citing an unidentified law enforcement source, reported in Friday editions that at least 12 phones had been tapped, including that of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, a colleague of <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s and a consultant associated with several defense contractors. The source also said one government employee received more than $ 100,000 in cash in return for information, and that investigators also were looking into allegations that personal bills, vacations and other expenses of government employees were paid by consultants, the newspaper reported. `` Information that <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> had that was not available to the contracting public'' included data on the sale of the F-16 fighter to the Swiss government, information from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on the Super Hornet F-18 and inside information pertaining to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>, the search warrant said. The warrant also sought a `` proposed letter to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> marked ` secret''' relating to the F-18, which the company wanted to sell in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In addition, the warrant authorized a search of <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>'s office for documentation pertaining to the advanced tactical aircraft program `` and <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s efforts to steer it toward <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Information about a company's competitors' offers ... is never disclosed to a company prior to the award of a contract,'' said the warrant. `` A company which has access to that information prior to the time when best and final offers must be submitted can benefit greatly.'' <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying that much of the information sought by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` was information properly supplied to the company. ... We are not aware of any improper requests by the company to Mr. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> or any improper activities by Mr. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> on behalf of the company.'' The firm said it is cooperating with the government. <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> issued a statement saying that his work for <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> `` has been thoroughly proper and legal. Any assertions or allegations to the contrary are false. I have never ... misused any information related to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, asked when he was first told by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aides of the investigation, said, `` I've been briefed on it some time ago. I ca n't remember exactly when.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s name turned up on at least one of the court-authorized wire taps installed as part of the probe, said federal law enforcement sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Because of that, he was not told of the investigation until late March, after it was determined by investigators he was not involved in any of the alleged wrongdoing, the sources said. `` We are hopeful that indictments will be completed within the next 30 to 90 days,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that the investigation `` in no way reflected on the procurement procedures of the -LRB- Defense -RRB- department. It appears that dishonest individuals tried to circumvent those procedures and that therefore we were taking the prompt action along with <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> investigators to get to the bottom of this.'' Asked how much of an embarrassment the probe was to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said: `` I do n't think it's an embarrassment. Quite the contrary. I think the fact that whenever you can uncover dishonest activity, investigate it thoroughly and then take the necessary action, it's a vindication of good governmental action, to weed out those people who are taking advantage of the system or committing improper or wrongful conduct. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has ordered two top officials to form a task force to monitor developments in the investigation and ascertain if contracting procedures must be overhauled. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, the undersecretary for acquisition, will head the panel.

 The deficit in the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign trade widened in the first quarter to $ 39.75 billion as the first deficit in investment earnings in 30 years offset a sharp improvement in the merchandise trade balance, the government has reported. The quarterly imbalance in the country's current account balance surged 18.6 percent from the fourth quarter's $ 33.5 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The current account is the most important trade statistic, because it covers not only merchandise trade but also trade in the services category, which reflects primarily the flow of investment earnings between countries.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Is Shrinking, Latest Statistic Notwithstanding</HEAD>

 Economists say the nation's trade deficit is shrinking decisively, in spite of a government report indicating that the broadest measure of trade worsened in the first three months of the year. At first, Wednesday's negative report on the current account imbalance seemed to contradict the report of a day earlier that the merchandise trade deficit fell in April to its lowest point since December 1984. But economists said the bad news was old news. In truth, they said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is well on the way to closing the gap between exports and imports. `` The trade deficit is on the mend in a fairly substantial way,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, director of economics for <ORGANIZATION> ASB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sparked a strong rally in the financial markets Tuesday when it announced that the April merchandise trade deficit shrank to $ 9.89 billion, far smaller than expectations. On Wednesday, the news seemed to sour when the department said the deficit in the broadest measure of trade, the current account, widened in the January-March period to $ 39.75 billion, up 18.6 percent from $ 33.5 billion in the last quarter of 1987. But financial markets shrugged off the negative report, which referred to trade news from early in the year that was superseded by the strong April results. Nevertheless, bewilderment over the seeming contradiction between the numbers was understandable, said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, senior economist of <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` It's confusing to economists. The rest of the people must be that much more confused,'' he said. The one dark spot in Wednesday's current account report was that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ran its first deficit in investment income in 30 years during the first quarter. The red ink in investment income was the result of foreigners' accumulations of huge holdings of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets in recent years For the first time, Americans had to pay out more in interest, dividends and rents to foreigners than they received on their holdings abroad. But the deficit on investment income did not disturb financial markets, because it was a predictable outcome of the persistent merchandise trade deficits. The investment income deficit is certain to get bigger in coming months because foreigners will continue adding to their holdings of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets as long as they run trade surpluses with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We're making progress on the trade front. But because we have such a large deficit, we're still piling up claims against us at a very rapid rate,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, executive vice president and chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The deterioration in the investment income account will not end until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> starts running surpluses in merchandise trade. That is likely to happen around the middle of the 1990s, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubarych </PERSON>, an economist at the consulting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kaufman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Carpenter of <ORGANIZATION> ASB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> thinks it could happen far sooner than that `` We will start having monthly surpluses within 12 to 15 months,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to sell its profitable <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> clothing chain will sever <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s ties to the specialty retailing business, and continue the asset sales needed to help pay for its recent acquisitions. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> decided to sell the chain because it has `` different customers, a different real estate base, a different buying structure'' than <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s nine department store divisions, <PERSON> Joele </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, with 103 upscale women's clothing stores across the country, was the last specialty division remaining in <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> acquired at the end of 1986. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> sold Allied's <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> chain to help finance the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A source close to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said Allied already has received interest in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, which had 1987 sales of $ 249 million <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> did not announce an asking price for the chain. Wednesday's announcement came less than a week after <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said it was selling <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s Basement specialty store division. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> also plans to sell two other Federated specialty chains, Children's Place and Main Street, as well as its Gold Circle discount store chain. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Seidler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amdec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, `` It's actually a gem.'' `` It's very unfortunate that he's deleting it from his portfolio,'' <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> said, `` but I can understand from the higher -LRB- real estate -RRB- asset value from department stores that he would want to preserve those and develop that area rather than the lease-oriented <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> chain.'' Analysts have said <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate developer, was interested in Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> mainly because of their real estate holdings. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> generally leases its retail space. The sale of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> leaves Allied with four department store chains: <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION>, the Bon and <ORGANIZATION> Maas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>. Most of Allied's store divisions were sold after <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> took it over, and the <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> specialty chain was sold after <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> took control of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. Proceeds from the previous sales were use to retire debt from the $ 3.4 billion Allied purchase, while funds from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> went toward the total $ 8.8 billion <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> is spending for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. In its announcement Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said some of the proceeds from an <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> sale also would be used to retire bank loans. Allied would use the remainder of the money to purchase shares in Federated, which in turn would use the funds to further reduce its own debt. Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> will be operated under the same management but will remain separate legal entities, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has said it expects to retain <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s department store chains, as well as its <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION> supermarkets division in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s have been merged into a single division.

<HEAD>Forecaster Expects 8.4 Percent Growth in Ad Spending This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Domestic advertising spending should rise 8.4 percent this year, its strongest showing in four years despite some unexpected weakness in local retail advertising, a widely followed ad forecaster says. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Coen </PERSON>, senior vice president for the ad agency <ORGANIZATION> McCann-Erickson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ad spending should rise to $ 118.8 billion. His forecast of 8.4 percent growth this year was slightly below his December prediction that spending would rise 9.0 percent in 1988, but it still exceeds rises of 7.4 percent in 1987, 7.8 percent in 1986 and 7.9 percent in 1985. `` The Olympics and the elections are helping to fuel a return to a higher growth rate for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ad spending in 1988 after a three-year drought,'' he told securities analysts at his semiannual briefing on ad spending trends. It would be the biggest gain since ad spending rose 15.8 percent in 1984, another year that also had the Olympics and presidential election. He said many large national marketers appear to have `` loosened their tight grip on budgets'' but are spending significantly more only `` when bargains or special considerations justify the increases.'' National advertising is expected to rise 9.4 percent to $ 66.35 billion, <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> said, while local ad spending will grow 7 percent to $ 52.47 billion. In the new forecast, <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> said national ad spending on television should rise 10 percent, the first double-digit rise in four years. The forecast includes a projection of an 11 percent rise in spending on the three major television networks. Network executives have complained in recent weeks that the national ad market has softened. Magazine ad revenue has risen 11 percent over the first four months of the year, but should slow and finish 8 percent ahead for the year, he said. The biggest adjustment in <LOCATION> Coen </LOCATION>'s forecast came in his estimates of newspaper ad spending. He said spending by local retailers, a major source of newspaper ad revenue, rose only 1 percent in the first quarter. He said the weather and worries about takeovers may have made some large retailers more cautious about spending. As a result, <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> said he scaled back his growth estimate for local ad spending in newspapers to 6 percent from 9 percent. Among the major ad categories, <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> said automakers boosted their spending on television and magazines by 18 percent in the first three months of the year, while makers of food, candy, soft drinks and cleaning products posted double-digit spending gains for the first time in several years. On the other hand, he said, cigarette advertising in magazines fell 6 percent in the quarter, and single-digit gains were posted by beer and airline companies. Outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> said he expects ad spending to grow 14 percent to $ 108.4 billion in 1988. That would mean worldwide ad spending would rise 10.9 percent to $ 227.2 billion. <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> said he tentatively expects <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ad spending to rise 7.5 percent to $ 127.7 billion in 1989. He said while the economy and profits are growing, many advertisers traditionally tighten ad budgets in a post-Olympic year.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will offer up to 50 percent more bang for the buck next week when it announces a new generation of computers for the vital center of its product line, a new report says. The introduction Tuesday of the new mid-sized computers will be `` one of the most important in <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s history,'' <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, Calif.-based market researcher, predicted Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is locked in a struggle with archrival <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for domination of the middle range of computing, and both companies have been rushing products to market. The new family of computers will succeed <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s System 36 and System 38, which are the world's biggest-selling computers above the ranks of personal computers. The existing machines are the workhorses for thousands of small and medium-sized businesses. They also are used as departmental computers in some big corporations, a niche where <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> has done especially well. Although the rivalry constantly is see-sawing, `` We expect this announcement to radically alter the balance in the mid-range'' in <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s favor, <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumgartner </PERSON> said. The new computers have been code-named <PERSON> Silverlake </PERSON> and <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> and will be unveiled as the AS-200 and AS-400 series, ranging in price from $ 30,000 to more than $ 300,000, <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> says. While the System 36 and System 38 are distinct machines that run different software, the new computers all will run the same software, although some older programs will have to be modified to run on them, analysts say. There are already nearly 300,000 members of the System 36-38 family installed worldwide, and over the next five years the new computers could raise the total to 700,000 systems with a value of more than $ 50 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s share of worldwide mid-sized computer shipments by U.S.-based companies slid to 23.6 percent in 1987 from 27.2 percent in 1984, while <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s rose over the same period to 18.9 percent from 15.2 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Each percentage point represents nearly $ 300 million in annual sales, so the battle for market share is intensely fought `` It will be probably the broadest announcement that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has ever attempted,'' in terms of the number of customers who will be affected, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Djurdjevic </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> watcher who is president of <ORGANIZATION> Annex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` The big news is that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is going to make the mid-range market exciting again, win or lose,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellomy </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` If <PERSON> Silverlake </PERSON> does n't take back some market share, then it will be a failure,'' <PERSON> Bellomy </PERSON> said. Digital and other computer companies are hoping to pick off some <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> customers during the transition by convincing them to switch to their products instead of trading up to the new <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> computer. `` If a customer's running out of capacity, they'd be doing their corporation a disservice not to look at Vax,'' <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s product line, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales consultants, said in an interview. The competitors' job will be easier if it is expensive and difficult to move software from the old computers to the new ones. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has promised that the new line will protect `` nearly all'' of customers' investments in applications software, but it has not been more <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> should be able to hang onto customers as long as it has done a respectable job of providing continuity to the new products, <ORGANIZATION> Annex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Djurdjevic </PERSON> predicted.

<HEAD>Centerre Accepts Boatmen's Buyout Offer Of $467 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Centerre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> has accepted a $ 60 a share stock swap merger offer worth about $ 467 million from <ORGANIZATION> Boatmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s biggest bank holding company, the companies announced Wednesday. Centerre, which in April had announced a $ 37 a share stock swap merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in May received a counter-offer of $ 50 a share, or a total of about $ 390, from <ORGANIZATION> Boatmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Boatmen </PERSON>'s later that month raised its offer to $ 55 a share. `` Our board carefully considered various merger and acquisition alternatives and concluded that <PERSON> Boatmen </PERSON>'s offer was in the best interest of Centerre shareholders,'' said <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON>, <PERSON> Centerre </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer. All three bank holding companies are based in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. If the acquisition is completed, the statement said, <PERSON> Boatmen </PERSON>'s will become the nation's 41st largest bank-holding company, with assets of about $ 14.7 billion and a trust business worth $ 33 billion The proposed acquisition is subject to approval by the shareholders of both companies and by the appropriate regulatory authorities. <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> <PERSON> MacCarthy </PERSON>, president of Centerre, will become vice chairmen of <PERSON> Boatmen </PERSON>'s, the statement said. <ORGANIZATION> Centerre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will continue to operate as a separate subsidiary as <ORGANIZATION> Boatmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> with the ultimate objective of consolidating all trust functions, it said.

 Bargainers for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Land Systems Division reached a three-year contract settlement late Wednesday night, averting a midnight strike at the defense contractor. The two sides put the finishing touches on a settlement covering 6,000 workers that includes a drug testing program UAW Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said would be mutually satisfying to the union and the company. Details of the tentative agreement were not immediately released, although <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said it included a substantial pay increase and a ratification bonus, along with improvements in health and safety provisions. `` Overall we were very happy,'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> told a late night news conference. `` We dealt with the substance abuse matter. Our members will agree to that I'm quite sure.'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said the contract would be explained to the workers represented by the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> at the Land Systems Division, a tank-making operation that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> bought from <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. The division has plants in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> and at <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. About 1,000 of the division's workers are on layoff. A ratification vote will take place in another seven to 10 days, the union said. The union had sought a 3 percent-per-year increase in the $ 13-an-hour base wage at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> and increased union representation to help workers with benefit questions, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said the company sought to reduce the number of job classifications, or strict definitions of individual jobs, and more flexibility in its use of workers. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said earlier that drug abuse was not a widespread problem in General Dynamics plants. General Dynamics and the union have a pilot Employee Assistance Program at the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>. Like similar programs at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, the professionally administered program uses counseling and education to help workers with drug and other problems. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said the union wants the EAP expanded to other Land Systems Division plants. General Dynamics was required to accept <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> contract when it purchased the Land Systems Division, and a contract negotiated in 1985 closely resembled Big Three auto contracts. Talks on a new three-year contract began April 11, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said.

 A federal appeals court has given <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> approval to file a bankruptcy reorganization plan. The <ORGANIZATION> 3rd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> also said that management may count votes cast at a shareholders meeting next week and announce the results immediately. The court, which handed down its ruling Tuesday, previously had said the appliance maker could do none of those things without court permission. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanoff </PERSON> said management plans to file a reorganization plan by the end of the month, but he declined to specify whether the filing would precede a shareholders' meeting June 20, when votes are to be cast for board seats. `` The sooner the company emerges from Chapter 11, the stronger it will be,'' Chairman <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travers </PERSON> said Wednesday. Under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, a company is protected from its creditors while it reorganizes.

 A tentative settlement reached between the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>' Land Systems Division is one of the first major labor contracts to contain a drug-testing policy, a union official says.

Our members will agree to that I'm quite sure,'' <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> told a news conference. `` All in all we are very happy.'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said the contract's approach, one of the first of its kind, `` deals with the rehabilitation aspects'' of drug abuse and will not mean that any workers will have to submit to random or mandatory drug testing. Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said the union would not agree with the company's demand for random, mandatory drug testing. He said details of the program have to be worked out, then explained to workers along with the rest of the contract. He said members would vote within the next seven to 10 days. Company officials were equally as pleased with the agreement on drug testing. `` As we all know, it's a national problem,'' said <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Rambeau </PERSON>, corporate vice president for human resources. `` It is involved in every community where we live. It's in every work place. We need to start with education and rehabilitation programs.'' General Dynamics and the union have a pilot drug program at the Warren plant, which uses counseling and education to help workers with drug problems. Other parts of the contract include a substantial pay increase over the three years of the contract, along with a ratification bonus and improved health and safety provisions, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. About 1,000 of the workers covered by the tentative agreement are on layoff, including 800 of the 2,700 Detroit-area workers. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rambeau </PERSON> declined to discuss specifics of how the contract will impact those workers, if at all, and also said they could not provide other specifics until union members are informed. <PERSON> Rambeau </PERSON>, however, said lump sum wage increases are included in the contract, as the company had wanted, but he would not elaborate. The union sought a 3 percent pay increase for the base wage of $ 13 an hour in each year of the pact. It also sought increased union representation to help workers with benefits questions, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Delors Says Farm Policy Dispute Could Spoil Toronto Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A U.S.-European dispute over farm policy reform may `` spoil the atmosphere'' of next week's seven-nation economic summit, a senior <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> official said Thursday <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, said a `` divergence of views'' remained between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> over how to reduce government support for agriculture. `` This ... could well spoil the atmosphere'' of the summit that starts Sunday in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> told a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> and other senior officials of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> executive <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will represent the 12-nation trade bloc at the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> meeting, which will be attended by the heads of government or state of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> said he expected no major new initiatives to emerge from the meeting. At last year's seven-nation economic summit President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> unveiled a proposal for phasing out government subsidies to farmers by the end of the century. The EEC has rejected the idea, saying it supports coordinated cuts in subsidies but that some government aid will always be necessary to properly manage farm markets. Last fall the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> proposed what it called `` short term'' measures aimed at easing immediate problems of overproduction of sugar, grain and other crops. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has criticized this approach. Farm reform is a central theme of the current <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of international trade liberalization negotiations being held under the auspices of the 93-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> also said discussions of key economic and trade issues at <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> would be made more difficult by the fact that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will soon leave office and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election contest is heating up. `` This will make discussion of the outlook for the world economy in 1989 and 1990 a little bit more difficult,'' <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> said, adding that it also would hamper discussion of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> trade liberalization talks. <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> said he would be explaining to his summit partners the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s new protocol agreement with the Soviet-led economic bloc, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. The protocol, in which the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc group extends formal recognition to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> for the first time, is to be signed by leaders of both organizations on June 25.

 <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has rejected a union contract proposal in the midst of a strike against three other <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> timber companies, according to a union official.

 Cattle farmers are sending cows to slaughter and mowing roadside ditches to feed remaining animals trying to survive one of the region's worst droughts since the Dust Bowl. Crop farmers, meanwhile, can only wait. `` Everybody is culling every cow that they do n't need. You're seeing a lot of older cows going to market,'' said <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION> farmer and regional vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> In northeast <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> on Wednesday, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> worked in his withering fields, which yielded 50 bushels of soybeans per acre last year. `` If we get 35 an acre, we'll be tickled to death,'' he said. `` We need a week of rain.'' Elsewhere in the nation's midsection and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION>, farmers turned to sometimes desperate measures to help relieve the drought that's prompted widespread water conservation and threatened farm yields, sending prices zooming on commodity exchanges. `` We get a daily report -LRB- on the drought -RRB- each day and I must say most days since early May anyway those reports have not been good,'' Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said today on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning. Asked if the situation was developing into a potential disaster, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> replied: `` Emphasizing the word potential, yes, that's correct The major corn belt area, this is the most reliable farming area in the world ... is threatened. It's a serious matter.'' Speaking on the same program, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Francl </PERSON> said: `` We are reaching a critical phase over the next week. If we do not have rain, that means there'll be substantial reductions in yields.'' But weather forecasters continued to bear bleak news after a dry winter followed by a parched spring. `` It's going to be dry across the Plains and the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> at least the next couple of days,'' <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said today. In Clyde, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, florist <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Doebel </PERSON> spurned traditional forecasting science and invited <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> <PERSON> Dog </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> medicine man from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, to perform an Indian rain ritual. `` Crow Dog will use prayers and offerings to appeal to the four winds of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> to bring the rain to <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Doebel </PERSON> said. Water levels on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> reached record lows, meanwhile, stranding at least 750 barges. Twice that many could become mired by the weekend, equaling `` a traffic jam of semi-trucks bumper to bumper from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Logue </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Vicksburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. Despite predictions of scattered showers and thunderstorms today, forecasters see no significant relief for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and the rest of the Corn Belt. The area from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> should get below-normal rain in the next month, while dry conditions should ease with above-normal rains in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states, according to a forecast by the weather service and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday, prices for future delivery of soybeans, corn and oats rocketed to their daily trading limits within seconds of the opening bell at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, a reflection of <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s gloomy assessment the day before <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, calling the drought a potential national disaster, said damage already had been done to wheat fields in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> and that additional dry weeks of scorching temperatures could cause severe damage in the Corn Belt and across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. `` If you got hay to sell, you can get whatever -LRB- price -RRB- you can ask. ... There just is n't any,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Luetmer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> dairy and grain farmer. <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>, who recently attended a cattlemen's meeting in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> on the drought, said farmers in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> have been forced to sell productive livestock to meatpackers because of parched pastures and rising feed prices. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s not far behind, he said. Meanwhile, cattlemen here are trimming their herds. `` I do n't see any liquidation yet, but it will be soon if we do n't get any rain,'' he said. `` There's certainly nothing growing up here.'' The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has allowed farmers in 96 of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s 99 counties to feed cattle on land originally left out of row crop production under the federal set-aside program. A similar measure was taken in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. `` The decision to allow haying and grazing on diverted acres was a lifesaver for us,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisdale </PERSON>, who has a herd of 70 beef cows on the farm she operates with her husband, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>, near <LOCATION> Milton </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> this week ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> to allow farmers to mow ditches along roads near their property and feed the hay to livestock. Farmers of row crops like corn and soybeans, meanwhile, are still holding out for rain to salvage 1988 yields, despite one of the worst droughts since the 1930s' Dust Bowl. Rep. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, who played `` Gopher'' in TV's `` The Love Boat,'' toured farms in his northwest <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> district last weekend. `` I saw stressed corn,'' he said Wednesday. `` The farmers were n't quite concerned yet, but everyone said 10 days could make a difference between having a serious condition and a critical condition.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia-owned </LOCATION> oil company today announced an agreement in principle to form a join venture for refining, distributing and marketing oil products in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> regions. The venture, in which each side will hold a half interest valued at $ 800 million, will maintain exclusive use of the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> trademark for marketing gasoline, diesel fuel and home heating oil in the 23-state region, a jointly released statement said. It said an agreement in principle forming the venture had been signed by officials of the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, - based oil giant and <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the Houston-based subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Arabian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, also known as <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, will hold half interest in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s refining assets and marketing system in 23 eastern and Gulf Coast States, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, the statement said. The assets in queston will include three major <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> refineries, located in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION>.; Convent, La.; and <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, in addition to 49 terminals, about 1,450 owned and leased service stations and a branded distributor network of more than 10,000 stations, it said. Saudi Refining will provide 75 percent of the venture's initial inventory, or about 30 million barrels of crude and products, and each side will pay in half of the net working capital. A barrel is the equivalent of 42 gallons. `` By sharing the inventory and working capital, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said it expects to achieve approximately $ 2 billion in cash benefits and savings from the formation of the joint venture based on current oil prices,'' the statement said. Although it has been known for some time that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had been negotiating this deal, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had indicated that it had been held up by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> reluctance to sign, until it knew whether financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s attempt to buy <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> would be successful. Earlier this year, the nation's third-largest oil company announced that it would pursue joint ventures such as this as part of the restructuring plan bringing it out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection. The company sought that protection while it was engaged in a multibillion-dollar legal dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. That dispute was resolved with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to pay $ 3 billion to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> emerged from bankruptcy court protection in April. In <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> was reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as describing the move as `` an important step in the kingdom's continuing program of cultivating oil industry marketing.'' The joint venture would provide the kingdom with `` a guaranteed utility for marketing Saudi crude oil and a good opportunity for the kingdom to take part in a profitable commercial venture in a country with a large marketing potential,'' <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said. Under the agreement announced today, the venture would have the right to buy up to 600,000 barrels of crude daily from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> at prevailing market prices. The partnership said it anticipated `` no significant changes in operations or staffing levels at the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> facilities involved, and no changes in the products and services provided to customers.'' The formation of the joint venture is subject to further approvals by the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government and <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board, as well as various <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governmental regulatory bodies. It is expected to be completed by the end of this year, the statement said.

 The stock market fell sharply today, erasing much of the gains posted in the previous two, record-setting sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which struggled to reach its second consecutive post-crash high Wednesday, was off 24.36 points at 2,107.04 in the first half hour of trading. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 28.06 million shares. Losers overpowered gainers by about 11 to 3 with 241 up, 886 down and 377 unchanged as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Market watchers attributed the decline to softness in the bond market. `` Let's face it, it's the rates that call the turn,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The whole stock market turns on rates.'' A pull-back in stock prices has been anticipated since the Dow has climbed more than 200 points in recent weeks. Analysts are not overly concerned by the decline and contend that the market needs a breather. Separately, another `` triple-witching hour'' looms on Wall Street, with groups of stock-index futures, stock-index options and options on individual stocks due to expire on Friday. Analysts are reluctant to predict what effect this quarterly phenomenon might have on the market. Among actively traded issues, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> was down -RRB- at 49 -LCB-.

<HEAD>Stocks Up, Retail Sales, Industrial Production Rise</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs on business inventories and sales; picks
up 2nd graf pvs, A late spurt ....</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Business inventories rose a moderate 0.5 percent in April as business sales slackened somewhat from March's torrid pace, the government said today. The build-up of inventories was about in line with expectations, and economists had expected sales to retreat after two strong months. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said inventories rose $ 3.6 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 723.7 billion, while total business sales fell 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 478.8 billion. On Wednesday, stock prices edged to new post-October crash highs as the government reported increases in May retail sales and industrial production and a widened first-quarter deficit in the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign trade. A late spurt in buying on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> pushed the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials up 6.93 points on Wednesday to 2,131.40, its second post-crash high in as many days. The blue-chip stock indicator climbed 25.07 points Tuesday. Before the market opened, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said retail sales rose 0.1 percent in May to $ 131.9 billion after a 0.4 percent drop in April. The sales gain was restrained by a 1.2 percent fall in automotive sales. Excluding autos, retail sales rose 0.5 percent in May. Sales of expensive durable goods expected to last three or more years were down 0.6 percent, while non-durable goods sales rose 0.5 percent. In another report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said industrial production rose 0.4 percent in May, the eighth consecutive increase in output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities. The May advance followed a revised 0.6 percent rise in April, initially estimated at 0.7 percent. With the latest growth, overall industrial production now stands 6.1 percent higher than it was a year ago. In the trade report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the deficit in the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign trade widened to $ 39.75 billion in the first quarter as the first deficit in investment earnings in 30 years offset a sharp improvement in the merchandise trade balance. The imbalance in the country's current account balance from January through March surged by 18.6 percent from a fourth quarter total of $ 33.5 billion. The current account is the most important of all the trade statistics because it covers not only merchandise trade but also trade in the services category, which reflects primarily the flow of investment earnings between countries. The report said the services category went from a fourth quarter surplus of $ 12 billion to a deficit of $ 655 million in the first quarter of this year, the first deficit in the investment category since 1958. The report on the current account came a day after another trade report showed the deficit in merchandise shipments narrowed to $ 9.89 billion in April, the smallest monthly deficit since December 1984. The current account figures showed a similar decline in the merchandise trade deficit. In the first quarter, it dropped 12.7 percent to $ 35.95 billion, the best improvement in five years. But the services deficit added $ 655 million to this figure and another $ 3.15 billion was added by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid payments and Social Security benefits paid to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> retirees living overseas.

 The stock market fell sharply today, erasing much of the gains posted in the previous two, record-setting sessions, as equities mirrored a plunge in bond prices. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which struggled to reach its second consecutive post-crash high Wednesday, was off 21.16 points at 2,110.24 in the first hour and a half of trading.

 Time runs slow on Ole Man River these days but the money's running out fast, as the 50 towboats in position to nudge 750 barges up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> sit stranded in record-low water levels caused by drought. Officials fear that up to 1,500 barges could become stranded by the weekend, equaling `` a traffic jam of semi-trucks bumper to bumper from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Logue </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Vicksburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. `` Nobody knows for a fact how long we will be here,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON>, a pilot with the towboat <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Detmar </PERSON>, Jr., stuck near this <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delta </LOCATION> town. `` Some of the boats have been here for three days _ at least three days.'' The low river levels have created bottlenecks in places such as <LOCATION> Vaucluse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Landing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, about three miles north of the <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, where the river is down to nine feet. Prospects of ending that bottleneck brightened today. `` Late yesterday afternoon, our navigation people were able to mark a secondary channel at <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> that we did n't know existed,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Logue </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, said today. `` Since we found the secondary channel, it looks like the small tows will be able to go ahead and pass. The larger tows will have to wait,'' he said. While tugboat owners are losing an estimated $ 10,000 a day in expenses, their crews are spending the time painting, performing light maintenance and even fishing. `` There's plenty of work, there's always something to do,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Southern </PERSON>, a first mate on the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, a northbound towboat pushing 30 barges north. The continuing drought throughout the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and Southeast has brought the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to its lowest levels for this time of year since <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> chronicled life on the Big Muddy and officials began chronicling river levels in 1872. The low water has forced barges to operate only during daylight and to lighten their loads, said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, vice president of the American Waterways Operators in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` Low water _ since the days of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> _ has been an occupational hazard, and they know how to deal with it. Things are somewhat restricted, but cargo is still moving,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Wednesday. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> barges carry such cargo as grain, petroleum, chemicals, iron and steel, he said. Barges with light loads wait here to be escorted one by one by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> channel patrol boat. In all, about 50 towboats were stranded Wednesday along with their charges, approximately 750 barges, officials said. The towboats, which displace more than 9 feet of water, were stranded in about 9 feet or less as they waited for the corps dredge <PERSON> Jadwin </PERSON> to arrive today to widen the channel. The <PERSON> Jadwin </PERSON> will take at least a day, and possibly two, to dredge the channel to a depth of 16-20 feet and allow the barges through, officials said. The drought has been good news for some, however. Waterways Marine, which takes orders by radio and delivers supplies to towboats passing by, has been doing a brisk business since the boats became stranded, said the company's general manager, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashmore </PERSON>. In addition to food and housekeeping supplies, <PERSON> Ashmore </PERSON> said, he is also selling a lot of fuel because many boats are keeping their engines running. Towboat owners are losing money because, in addition to food, fuel and salary expenses, they get paid per ton-mile, and every lost day is lost tonnage that could be delivered, <PERSON> Ashmore </PERSON> said. The river gauge at <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, about 70 miles south of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, read 2.5 feet Tuesday. The lowest level ever recorded was minus 7 feet in February 1940, when much of the upper river was frozen, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, chief of water control management for the corps district. <PERSON> Ashmore </PERSON> said some pilots are resorting to ingenious methods to try and get through what has become an increasingly narrow and shallow channel near <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>. One pilot radioed <PERSON> Ashmore </PERSON> to ask if he could unload most of the fuel from his tanks to make his boat light enough to get through. <PERSON> Ashmore </PERSON>, however, said he was n't able to help the pilot.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Limit-Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened sharply higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with corn prices for near-term delivery rocketing up the daily trading limit for the third consecutive day on dry-weather fears. The exchange expanded corn price limits from 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel on Wednesday _ the second day of limit gains _ in accordance with its rules. The higher limit will remain in effect at least through Monday. Most oat futures also opened up their daily limit of 10 cents a bushel. Some soybean contracts surged their 30-cents-a-bushel limit at the opening, but prices fell back on reports that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration would consider limiting soybean exports if the drought in the Grain Belt continues. `` That goes without saying _ they're going to have to reduce exports if we have a smaller crop,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Scattered showers brought relief to isolated sections of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and there is a chance of rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> this weekend. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday predicted below-normal rainfall for the region in the middle and latter portions of next week. In early trading, wheat was 2 -RCB- cents to 8 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.91 a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 15 cents higher with July at $ 2.94 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 10 cents higher with July at $ 2.89 \ a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents to 24 cents higher with July at $ 9.44 a bushel Most cattle futures were lower while pork futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .50 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at 69.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 1.50 cents lower across the board with August at 70.27 cents a pound; hogs were .70 cent lower to .80 cent higher with June at 48.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .72 cent lower to 1.78 cents higher with July at 43.75 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures closed sharply lower on Wednesday.

 Interest rates headed higher as bonds plunged in value in early trading today, reflecting widespread concerns about possible hikes in rates overseas, a weak dollar and inflation. Long-term issues took the biggest hit. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond jumped to 8.94 percent from 8.83 percent late Wednesday, while it fell 1 \ point in price, or $ 12.50 per $ 1,000 in face amount Prices of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities started out lower overseas and that carried over into domestic trading following an unconfirmed report from a West German newspaper indicating that country's central bank might be tightening monetary policy. The report said the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> would raise its securities repurchase rate, a key interest rate, one-quarter percentage point to 3.5 percent. `` It is possible,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> He noted that a high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> official recently indicated that his country was concerned about inflation due to better-than-expected economic growth in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and a rise in money supply. At the same time, the West German mark has been weak against the dollar in foreign exchange, and the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> has intervened on several occasions by selling dollars to buy marks. Tightening credit through a hike in interest rates would keep West German inflation in check and also support the mark, <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond traders were concerned that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> might also be tightening policies, especially as its economy continues to grow, and that could carry over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Adding a negative tone to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets today was a decline in the dollar in foreign exchange and another rise in commodity prices, both of which heighten concerns about inflation, Ms. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities, such as bonds and notes. By midday today in the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues fell between \ point and -RRB- point, intermediate maturities ranged from -LCB- point to -RCB- point lower and long-term issues declined between 1 3-16 point and 1 \ point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a business-information service The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.65 to 110.03. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, stood at 1,152.22, down 6.71. In corporate trading, industrials and utilities fell nearly a point in light trading, according to the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, lost 1.21 to 283.93 Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were up 2 basis points to 6.35 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills rose 6 basis points to 6.60 percent and one-year bills were up 8 basis points at 6.91 percent. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 7 7-16 percent, down from 8 \ percent late Wednesday The key rate had risen in Wednesday's session on technical factors.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> chieftains and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the company's largest shareholder, come to their showdown Friday as the last ballots are cast in a proxy fight that could lead to the biggest corporate buyout in American history. But the winner wo n't be known for weeks. It is expected to take that long to sort out the proxy ballots. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, holder of 14.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 243 million shares, is running with four allies for the five seats up for election to the company's 14-member board. He is seeking the seats to pressure the company to let stockholders vote on his offer to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shares he does not already own for $ 60 each, or about $ 12.4 billion. Adding the $ 1.2 billion he already paid for his stake would raise the acquisition cost to $ 13.6 billion, the biggest sum ever paid in a corporate buyout. Two weeks ago <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said if he lost, he would sell his stake and `` go away,'' but in recent days he said he might try a hostile takeover bid. Voting has been going on since late May and ends officially at <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting Friday in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>. In the last hours, it was widely believed there was no clear front-runner. Several major institutions were reported to have cast their votes for <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, while others were said to be leaning toward <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>. Traditionally, individuals tend to vote for management, but various sources said it was impossible to assume anything this time. On Wall Street, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shares have traded near $ 50 a share, reflecting the market's skepticism that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> will be able to pull of the deal. The annual meeting will bring to a head the latest phase of a months-long war of nerves, invective, lawsuits, charges and counter-charges between the nation's third largest oil company and the wily takeover artist. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Ichan </PERSON> tried to force <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to buy out his stake for an above-market price, a practice known as greenmail, and that he tried to manipulate its stock. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> called the allegation a `` fairy tale,'' and said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> offered to pay him greenmail but he refused. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, in turn, argued that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s management `` misappropriated'' corporate assets in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> called the charge a `` complete fabrication.'' Both sides have lawsuits pending against the other. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> begain buying up <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shares last fall, while the company was struggling to overcome a $ 10.3 billion judgment held against it by <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> won the judgment when a jury ruled <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had improperly interfered with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s deal to acquire part of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, then bought <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> itself The ruling ultimately led to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s filing for bankruptcy court reorganization in April 1987. A December agreement by <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to settle with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3 billion was the keystone of the reorganization plan ultimately approved by the court in April. But not without stiff opposition from <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. He battled against <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s management to strip antitakeover provisions from its charter. Amid increasing acrimony, he accused <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> management of `` getting itself into this multibillion-dollar mess,'' then seeking to entrench itself at the shareholders' expense. In turn, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> and other top executives accused <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> of seeking to bolster his own profits at the expense of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s other stockholders. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> lost some of those battles, but won some others, at times with support from shareholders equally unhappy with the company's performance _ and particularly with the bankruptcy filing, which resulted in the suspension of its dividend for one year As a result, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> agreed to include a vote on certain `` corporate governance'' on the proxy ballot, including, among others, restrictions on the adoption of takeover defenses, an anti-greenmail provision and more participation by shareholders in choosing directors. It also talked up its restructuring plan, a major feature of which was sales of $ 3 billion worth of underperforming assets. But that was not enough for <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. In February he announced his intention to run his five-man slate for the board. At the time, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock was selling near $ 38 a share. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> offered to withdraw his slate, if management took more steps to raise <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price. With an eye to restless stockholders, management restored the $ 3 annual dividend and added an additional $ 2 billion in proposed asset sales. It also struck back in early May, accusing <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> of violating federal securities laws and asking a federal judge to bar him from using his stock against the company. Weeks of peace talks ensued, as <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> sought to find a way to dispose of his stake without depressing <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s price at the same time. After <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> broke off the talks on May 25, he announced his buyout offer, which put a $ 14.6 billion value on the company. But <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> refused to let shareholders vote on the proposal, prompting <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> to launch his proxy fight.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> bugged the office and tapped the phone of a former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official as part of the government's massive investigation of defense fraud, government sources said today. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials to stress his desire for `` a full and thorough investigation as rapidly as possible,'' his spokesman said. The bug and wiretap were at the office of defense contractor consultant <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who from 1981 to April 1987 was assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for research, engineering and systems, a key acquisition post under former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> now has numerous defense contractors as clients. The sources were confirming a report in today's editions of The Washington Post. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with the government's top law enforcement officials, including Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, new head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, along with top <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides, including counsel <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON>. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> described <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as `` very concerned,'' and added: `` We ca n't go into any details of the investigation in terms of the discussion or what they told the president. But suffice to say everyone wants to pursue this with the utmost vigor and determination.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the matter `` certainly poses an internal security problem'' and told reporters that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` feels that this is a matter that deserves his attention and that everyone involved should know of his feelings, the intensity which he feels about dealing with any kinds of crimes that have been committed here.'' Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said later that <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> had ordered two top officials to begin forming a special task force that would monitor developments in the investigation and ascertain if contracting procedures must be overhauled. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, the under secretary for acquisition, would head the panel. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, a search warrant unsealed in federal court said <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> provided `` classified and-or confidential'' documents to one of his clients, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, on contracts being sought by the company. In two of those contracts, worth billions of dollars, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> is competing against <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has its headquarters in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, federal agents searched the office of a <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> executive as part of the probe of alleged bribery and fraud in defense contracting. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> was served with a search warrant, along with 14 other defense contractors, and 38 search warrants were issued Tuesday and Wednesday in 12 states. According to the search warrant unsealed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, part of the scheme involved the illegal disclosure of confidential or classified information and the `` exertion of influence'' on <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contracts. The search warrant alleges that former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials bribed current government employees to get the information, then gave it to defense contractors who had hired the former officials as consultants. The investigation of <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> appears to center on <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Paisley </LOCATION>. The warrant says <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> `` substantial information obtained from government officials which has been classified and-or confidential or not available to the contracting public.'' The warrant said agents were looking for evidence of bribery of public officials, violations of conflict-of-interest laws, theft of government property, fraud and conspiracy. <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>'s was the only office at <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to be searched, according to the warrant. Items seized in the search of <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>'s office included calendars, card files, computer discs, memos, status reports and video cassettes. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also placed a court-authorized wiretap in the office of <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, the civilian official responsible for buying tactical battle command, control, communications and computer systems for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, sources speaking on condition of anonymity told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. A court-authorized tap also was installed in the office of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for acquisition management, international programs and congressional support, said the sources. Federal investigators armed with evidence from the wiretaps, hich have been in place for much of the two years of the probe, are preparing to approach witnesses who now may be cooperate with the government's massive <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing fraud probe. The probe has turned up `` rampant bribery in the government'' and includes allegations of cash payments, purchase of cars and payments of bills for government employees, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> said Wednesday. The government is now preparing to approach people whose voices are recorded on the taps and who are implicated in possibly illegal acts, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` They're going to confront them with the tapes and see who they can flip'' into becoming government witnesses, one source said Wednesday. The White House said Wednesday that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was among many top government officials who were not told in advance of the probe. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was not told of the investigation until late March because his name came up on one of the wiretaps, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today, citing unidentified sources for the information. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said there were many cases where companies `` paid $ 500 or $ 1,000 to a government employee for proprietary information and then went out and sold it for $ 50,000.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> made the statements in comments inadvertently recorded as he spoke to committee chairman Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., prior to a congressional hearing One warrant sought information from two offices at <ORGANIZATION> Cubic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, about a sophisticated electronic pilot training system used by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, vice president and general counsel at <ORGANIZATION> Cubic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said the company used a consultant, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, whose office files also were searched in the probe Government sources said federal investigators also tried to question two Cubic employees who had spoken with <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, but were told by company lawyers not to do so. Search warrants were served on at least six current or former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees. Among the offices searched was that of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, an official in the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command. Stone is director of the information management services and information transfer purchases division.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar declined against the major currencies in European trading Thursday, mainly because of uncertainty over why the West German central bank was selling dollars. Gold prices were mixed. Foreign exchange dealers said the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> sold about $ 210 million Wednesday and Thursday. They said there were rumors the bank will increase money market interest rates next week, making the West German currency more attractive. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, British pounds were more expensive for buyers at $ 1.7900 dollars, up from $ 1.7848 late Wednesday. Other late rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Wednesday's late rates, included: 1.7505 West German marks, down from 1.7535; 1.4580 Swiss francs, down from 1.4675; 5.9005 French francs, down from 5.9137; 1.9650 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9690; 1,299.50 Italian lire, down from 1,300.62; and 1.2160 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2170. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 125.98 Japanese yen, down from 126.32 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Thursday, the dollar traded at 125.65 yen and dealers said the dollar's fall against the German mark was the main reason for the decline. Gold bullion prices were mixed, moving higher in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and lower in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>. Traders said their market was nervous and prices fluctuated throughout the day in a narrow range, underpinned by rising commodity prices in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of drought but weakened by lower oil prices. Gold closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 452.80 a troy ounce, up from Wednesday's late $ 452.60. The closing price in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> was $ 452.50 bid, down from $ 453. After the gold market in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> was shut for a holiday Wednesday, gold closed there Thursday at $ 454.52, up from $ 452.58 Tuesday. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid $ 7.21 a troy ounce, up from $ 7.14.

<HEAD>Americans Say New Tax Law Less Fair Than Old Statute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A majority of Americans questioned in a recent survey say the tax law that went into effect last year is less fair than the old statute, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The results of the poll indicate public opinion about the tax law has become more negative now that it has been in effect for more than a year. The 5,000 households questioned in the survey were asked how fair they felt the new law was, regardless of how it affected them personally. Fifty-three percent said they felt the new law was less fair than the old law, while 14 percent said they were fairer, and 33 percent said they saw little change from the old law, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The results contrast with a survey taken after the new law was passed in 1986. At that time, one-third of the respondents said the statute was less fair, the business research organization said. The most dissatisfaction with the new law came from upper-income households, those with incomes above $ 50,000 a year. In that group, 62 percent said the new statute was less fair, 15 percent said it was fairer and 23 percent said they saw no change. Forty-six percent of the overall respondents in the latest survey said their taxes have gone up since the new law was implemented, while 36 percent said their taxes were the same and 18 percent said they were lower. Among upper-income respondents, 63 percent reported their taxes were higher, 21 percent said they were the same and 16 percent said they were lower. The survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percent, was conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

 The stock market tumbled lower today as equities mirrored a plunge in bond prices and erased much of the gains posted in the previous two, record-setting sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which struggled to reach its second consecutive post-crash high Wednesday, was off 26.67 points at 2,104.73 at mid-afternoon. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 114.52 million shares. Losers led gainers by about 11 to 5 with 438 up, 992 down and 475 unchanged as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Market watchers said the decline was triggered by disarray in the credit markets, which were reacting to an unsubstantiated report in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> newspaper that indicated the central <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> might be tightening monetary policy. `` There are some indications that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> might be doing the same, and that says effectively that if the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> wants to keep the dollar stable, it will not give interest rates much room to decline,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Frist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year issue was off 1 \ points, or $ 12.50 per $ 1,000 in face value at midday `` Everybody is picking up on its cue,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The dollar also fell in value. `` Let's face it, it's the rates that call the turn,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The whole stock market turns on interest rates.'' A pull-back in stock prices has been anticipated since the Dow has climbed more than 200 points in recent weeks. But analysts described today's drop, which was exacerbated by profit-taking, as jolting. `` In the last two days, the market's performance has been impressive,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` This just points out what thin ice we're on.'' Analysts fear a crack in the confidence that has been building, but lower stock prices also could bring out some bargain hunters. `` We would use any weakness as a buying opportunity,'' one trader said. Among actively traded issues, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> was down -RRB- at 49 -LCB-. The oil company, which will face off against <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> it its annual shareholders meeting Friday, announced a joint venture with a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> oil company. General Electric was off -RRB- at 43 -LRB-. The company said it will acquire <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s chemical division for $ 2.31 billion in cash.

 Share prices fell Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as equities followed Wall Street lower, giving market players an opportunity to sell and take some profits. At the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was down 7.4 points, or 0.40 percent, at 1,861.9. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 20.09 points at 2,111.31 as the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading session drew to a close, after opening about 12 points lower. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealers said their market moved into negative territory during the afternoon as it became evident that Wall Street was heading lower, pressured by a swift decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond prices. Analysts said it was not suprising to see such a technical correction in bond prices after their sharp gains over the past several weeks. Dealers said major market players were resuming their cautious stance, as inflationary fears were thought to be creeping back into the market. One equity analyst with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stockbrokerage <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said the market still is not convinced that it is on a stable footing. `` It's far too early after the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> April -RRB- trade figures to say we've seen the bottom of the bear market and there are plenty more factors for Wall Street to take account of,'' he said. A barrage of British economic data unsettled the market, raising fears that the economy may be growing too quickly for its own good, analysts said. The British <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> reported that the public sector borrowing requirement, the most widely used measure of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s government deficit or surplus, showed a surplus of 624 million pounds in May, down from a revised surplus of 1.129 billion pounds in April.

<HEAD>Japan's Economy Grows 4.9 Percent In Fiscal 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s muscular economy, shrugging off the burden of a strong currency, grew faster in the first three months of 1988 than at any time since 1977, according to figures released Thursday. Boosted by personal spending and housing investment, the economy grew 2.7 percent in the January-March period after adjustment for inflation, the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. That came to an unusually robust annual growth rate of 11.3 percent, the fastest since the January-March period of 1977, when the annual growth rate was 11.7 percent, records show. Although growth rates tend to fluctuate erratically from quarter to quarter, economists said the increase was nevertheless an impressive sign of strength. The first three months of 1988 represent the final quarter of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 1987 fiscal year. Growth for the entire fiscal year came to 4.9 percent after adjustment for inflation, more than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the agency said. A year ago, economic planners were worried that the soaring value of the Japanese yen would drive the economy into a recession by making Japanese exports too expensive for foreign purchasers. Instead, the value of the yen stabilized and Japanese companies found ways to cut costs and keep their prices competitive in world markets. `` It is easy for many Japanese exporters to overcome this yen increase. Now they're feeling very comfortable, exporting many goods to not only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but many <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries and European countries,'' said <PERSON> Yoshihisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitai </PERSON>, a New York-based economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Term </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>. At the same time, the economy has become less dependent on exports because of a government-fueled expansion of the domestic economy. The government has provided easy credit and undertaken a multitrillion-yen housing and public works program. The 1987 real growth rate of 4.9 percent topped the government's revised target of 3.7 percent for real growth _ that is, growth after adjusting for the effects of inflation The government predicted real growth of 3.8 percent in fiscal 1988. Officials said personal spending, which normally accounts for about 55 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s gross national product, rose 4.0 percent in fiscal 1987 from a year earlier. Housing investment rose by 23.9 percent and industrial equipment investment rose by 10.1 percent, both compared with fiscal 1986, the official said. Housing investment softened at the end of the fiscal year. Housing starts in January, February and March were up 2 percent from a year earlier after a string of double-digit increases. However, consumer spending in the quarter was strong. An additional shopping day in February helped boost consumer spending, said <PERSON> Shingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Unami </PERSON>, an economist for <ORGANIZATION> Yasuda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s growth outpaced the growth in the 1987 calendar year of 2.9 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 4.8 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, 1.7 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 2.2 percent in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and 3.1 percent in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, but trailed the growth of 12.0 percent in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, officials said

<HEAD>Report: Bundesbank to Raise Key Interest Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A West German financial newspaper reported Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> planned to raise a key interest rate next week, although the central bank had no comment on the report. The article in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Handelsblatt </ORGANIZATION> disturbed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial markets, where stock and bond prices fell sharply on fears that American interest rates would rise also. The newspaper said the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> decided at its Wednesday policymaking meeting to increase the securities repurchase rate, which is the rate the central bank pays to trade in securities in the open market, a quarter percentage point to 3.25 percent. The West German central bank has kept the rate constant at 3.25 percent since Nov. 24 of last year as an indication of its policy of stable interest rates and ample money-market liquidity. A <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said he could neither confirm nor deny the rate hike report. However, a top West German banking official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said several developments have made the situation ripe for an increase. He listed those developments as a rise in interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries, a widening gap between German long-term and short-term rates, a climbing dollar, and a weakening West German mark. Another official, <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Huefner </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>'s hike in the `` repo rate,'' if implemented next week, would n't necessarily cause criticism from its partners in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or overseas. To brake the dollar's recent rise, either the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has to lower its interest rates or West German interest rates have to go up, <PERSON> Huefner </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybeans Close Higher While Wheat Declines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Futures prices of corn, oats and soybeans closed sharply higher Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> while wheat futures plunged on fears of a reduction in export sales. The three corn contracts for 1988 delivery advanced the limit for daily trading for the third consecutive session as dry conditions prevailed in the parched Corn Belt. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> expanded its daily price limit for corn from 10 to 15 cents a bushel Thursday following two days of 10-cent advances. But profit-taking limited the gains in soybean prices, analysts said. `` I think this demonstrates the more serious concern about potential damage to corn than to the other crops,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The sell-off in wheat futures was prompted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s statement early Thursday that export subsidy programs may be reviewed if the drought continues, analysts said. Traders sold wheat futures heavily despite <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s denial of any plans to reduce subsidized exports. At the close, wheat was 8 -LCB- cents to 16 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.78 a bushel; corn was 6 -LCB- cents to 15 cents higher with July at $ 2.94 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 4 -LCB- cents to 10 cents higher with July at $ 2.89 a bushel; soybeans were 6 -LCB- cents lower to 22 cents higher with July at $ 9.42 a bushel.

<HEAD>European Industry Criticizes EEC Merger Control Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of leading European industrialists on Wednesday criticized rules for regulating mergers that has been proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roundtable </ORGANIZATION> said parts of the proposals were unclear or unworkable, echoing similar criticisms leveled last month by <ORGANIZATION> UNICE </ORGANIZATION>, a federation of employer organizations. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says merger rules are necessary as the 12-nation bloc moves to create a unified market by 1992 and has proposed that it be given the power to block mergers judged to be anti-competitive. The Roundtable, which consists of about three dozen big companies, said that `` it was concerned that the present draft of the merger regulation does n't sufficiently support corporate restructuring.'' It said the commission should only be able to block a merger if it could show that competition would be eliminated `` in the relevant market.'' It also said any control by the commission should allow companies to make rapid decisions so that possible mergers would not fail simply due to administrative procedures.

<HEAD>NY Merc To Pursue Consolidation With Comex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that its board favors consolidating some of the exchange's operations with those of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> officials planned to discuss a `` new plan'' with <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> officials early next week, but gave no details of what it involved. He declined further comment. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, said the exchange would have no comment until after the meeting. She said top Comex officials were in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The two exchanges have periodically discussed the possibility of consolidating some of their operations for the past decade, but their talks have intensified in the past year. The Mercantile Exchange, established in 1882, offers trading in oil, palladium and platinum futures. Volume totaled 25.7 million contracts last year. The exchange has about 750 members and employs about 300 people. The Commodities Exchange began operating in 1933 and offers trading in gold, silver and copper futures and options and in aluminum futures. Its volume amounted to 21.5 million contracts in 1987. The exchange has 772 full members and employs about 400 people. A report by a private consulting firm recommended last year that the exchanges consolidate non-operating functions, such as the legal and the administrative staffs, while keeping trading operations separate. The Comex board endorsed the consultant's recommendations late last year, but the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> took no action on it. In its statement Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said its board adopted a resolution Wednesday night saying it `` intends to pursue the consolidation of appropriate operational and administrative functions.'' It said consolidation would maximize efficiency and productivity and achieve economies of scale. The <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s board asked committees of both exchanges to `` develop specific plans to consolidate operations'' with the Comex.

 Assets of the nation's 429 money market mutual funds fell $ 2.45 billion in the latest week, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The decline, to $ 264.80 billion in the seven-day period ended Wednesday, followed a $ 1.73 billion drop in the funds' assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade group. The funds' assets hit a record high $ 280.02 billion in the week ended Feb. 24. The <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that in the latest week, assets of 214 general purpose funds fell $ 1.63 billion to $ 81.31 billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds dropped $ 371.5 million to $ 113.33 billion, and assets of 118 institutional funds declined $ 450.3 million to $ 70.16 billion. The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in the week ended Tuesday to 6.50 percent from 6.42 percent the previous week, according to <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in <LOCATION> Holliston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The 30-day average yield rose to 6.39 percent from 6.33 percent, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was unchanged at 37 days, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. Separately, the newsletter <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION> said its survey of 100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield available on money market accounts was 5.73 percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.

 Stock prices took a sharp tumble today, mirroring a plunge in bond prices and erasing gains in the previous two sessions that had put the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials at a post-crash high. The Dow had climbed 32 points in the previous two sessions, and analysts said there was a natural tendency for some profit-taking to set in. But the day's decline was exacerbated sharply by disarray in the credit markets, which were reacting to an unsubstantiated report in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> newspaper that indicated the central <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> might be tightening monetary policy. `` There are some indications that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> might be doing the same, and that says effectively that if the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> wants to keep the dollar stable, it will not give interest rates much room to decline,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Frist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year issue was off 1 | points, or more than $ 16 per $ 1,000 in face value in late afternoon Further pressuring the markets was a government report that showed operating rates at American factories, mines and utilities rose to 82.9 percent in May, the highest level in more than eight years. The report, well above market expectations, was interpreted as a sign that inflation may be lurking on the horizon. Analysts fear a crack in investors' confidence, which has been building gradually. But lower stock prices also could bring out some bargain hunters.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will buy <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s chemical business for $ 2.31 billion in cash in a deal announced Thursday that will help <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION> pay off the huge debts acquired in going private last year. The deal will also swell the size of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s rapidly growing plastics business, which will do sales of nearly $ 3 billion this year. `` This is a big-time deal,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heymann </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's a risk-free area -LRB- for <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and it's not controversial.'' Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION> will use the proceeds to reduce the debt it took on last year in a $ 4.7 billion leveraged buyout to avoid a takeover by <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION> took on bank debt of $ 3.4 billion in going private and has been reducing it through proceeds from asset sales <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION> said it will have no trouble meeting the agreement with banks to repay their loans by the end of 1988. `` It's a slam dunk,'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trauscht </PERSON>, the chief financial officer, said in an interview Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION> chemical business, headquartered in <LOCATION> Parkersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, had sales of $ 1.25 billion in 1987 It is the worldwide leader in resins for a kind of plastic, ABS, that is widely used as a substitute for metal or glass. `` This acquisition is an important step in our worldwide materials strategy,'' <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiner </PERSON>, senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION>, said in a news release. <PERSON> Heymann </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s plastics business has accounted for about 5 percent of sales and 12 percent of earnings. He predicted that in 1989, the expanded business would account for 10 to 12 percent of sales and 18 to 20 percent of earnings. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said it expects the purchase to add about 5 cents a share to its profits in 1989 after all acquisition costs are paid. <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s other businesses are automotive components, and information and protective services. The company's protective services includes armored cars, guards and alarm stations under the names of <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Burns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. Auto components include transmissions, transmission components and four-wheel drive components. <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s leveraged buyout, led by <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, included the payment to shareholders of more than $ 4.1 billion in cash and slightly less than $ 300 million in junk bonds, as well as the assumption of a little under $ 300 million in debt. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> owns 51 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. Among other asset sales, the company sold <ORGANIZATION> BWAC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a finance unit, for $ 782.5 million to <ORGANIZATION> Transamerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Chilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, its credit-reporting subsidiary, to <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 360 million. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said it will also assume $ 35 million in <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term debt GE has been rapidly expanding its <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> unit, which expects sales of nearly $ 3 billion this year. It invested $ 325 million for a new polycarbonate plant in <LOCATION> Burkville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, last year, and will double the size of the plant by 1990 at a cost of $ 315 million. In May, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silicones </ORGANIZATION> announced an agreement to combine with <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s silicones business to form <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silicones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture with annual sales of about $ 750 million. <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s chemical specialty, <ORGANIZATION> ASB </ORGANIZATION>, which stands for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, is a thermoplastic with strength and molding characteristics that make it popular for such uses as computer housings, helmets and car parts. `` We think this is a good fit with <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Heymann </PERSON> said. `` It moves -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- into new niches within the same product markets and it does give GE new geographical markets.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> has not been a big factor in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, an area where he said <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION> is `` a dominant player.'' The transaction is subject to government approvals and is expected to be completed by the end of 1988, the companies said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> announced Thursday they will jointly refine and market petroleum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under a pact that the troubled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil giant said would give it $ 2 billion in cash and cost savings. It was the biggest joint venture ever announced between a foreign supplier and a domestic oil company in the `` downstream'' end of the business, the process for changing crude into gasoline and other products. Such a venture would help provide an assured market for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's biggest exporter of oil. But some analysts said it raised serious questions about the consequences of increased foreign leverage over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil industry, which has become more reliant on imports in the past few years. `` We've been predicting for months that this joint venturing of refining and marketing assets would accelerate,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaspar </PERSON>, oil analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It could potentially put the smaller refining and marketing operators at a disadvantage.'' The announcement also came as <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> management took a battle against takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> to its annual shareholder meeting Friday, which could determine the destiny of the nation's third-largest oil company The timing of the announcement reflected the intense pressure management faced to foil <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> by convincing shareholders it was taking aggressive steps to restructure <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and raise the value of their investment. `` <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> is locked in the struggle with <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, and it is coming down to the wire,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Clearly <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> managers need to tell their story: We are a new company, we've put the past behind us. We're aggressively going to downsize. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> management has said it plans to sell about $ 5 billion in property to offset the disastrous effects of prolonged litigation with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which resulted in bankpruptcy protection and a $ 3 billion payment to that company. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, has denounced management performance and has offered to buy <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> for $ 60 a share. But doubts about who will prevail helped depress the stock by 62 -LCB- cents a share Thursday to $ 49.25. Under a letter of intent between <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will have a half interest in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s refining assets and marketing system in 23 eastern and Gulf Coast states as well as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a company statement said. The joint venture's assets will include three major <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> refineries, in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION>.; Convent, La.; and <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; 49 terminals, about 1,450 owned and leased service stations and a distributor network of more than 10,000 stations. The statement said Saudi interest in these assets was valued at $ 800 million and the Saudi side would provide 30 million barrels of the venture's initial inventory of 40 million barrels. It said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> expected to `` achieve approximately $ 2 billion in cash benefits and savings from the formation of the joint venture based on current oil prices.''

 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended June 6, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,018 billion from $ 3,011 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,795 billion from $ 3,785 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose $ 2.4 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 773.5 billion in the week ended June 6 from a revised $ 771.1 billion the previous week. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.

<HEAD>Former Beech-Nut Executives Receive 1-Year Prison Terms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two former top executives of <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutritional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were sentenced Thursday to a year and a day in prison for distributing phony apple juice intended for babies. The case, one of the largest consumer fraud prosecutions of its kind, involved the intentional shipment of adulterated and misbranded juice to 20 states, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and five foreign countries between 1978 and 1982. `` The fraud was too extensive and too involved to go unpunished,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who also levied $ 100,000 fines against the defendants, <PERSON> Neils </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON>, 54, the former president and chief executive officer of the company, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>, 56, a former vice president. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> ordered both to pay court costs, which authorities estimated would run into the tens of thousands of dollars, as well as a special assessment of $ 50 for each of the hundreds of counts on which they were convicted. Beech-Nut, a subsidary of <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, is the nation's second-largest baby food maker after <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION> Prior to sentencing, <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> begged the judge to spare him a prison term. His voice was thick with emotion and at one point he wiped a tear from his eye. `` It would be so much easier to endure the torment if I had been alone without a family. ... I can not bear to look at them. I see in their eyes disappointment, hurt, disgust and fear for the future because of my condition,'' <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> said. `` I ask for them and myself, please do n't send me to jail.'' <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>, who are free on bail pending appeal, have been on full paid leave from <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION>, according to a company spokesman. Court documents show that <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> received an annual salary of $ 165,000 and <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> was paid $ 82,000. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, in his presentencing statement, asked that the defendants receive substantial prison terms because they had `` perpetrated a massive fraud on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and foreign consumers.'' Customers were `` deprived of the choice of what to feed their babies,'' <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said. `` They betrayed the sacred trust accepted by anyone who undertakes to provide nutrition to infants.'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said the details of the case pertaining to economic fraud were `` pretty extraordinary.'' `` I have no alternative than to do what I am going to do,'' he said before imposing the sentences. The two executives, along with <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> and two suppliers, were charged in the phony juice scheme. The juice, labeled 100 percent apple juice for babies, was actually made from a flavored concentrate that had little or no apple juice, prosecutors charged. No evidence was presented that the phony juice caused any health problems. Beech-Nut, as a corporation, pleaded guilty in November to 215 counts of violating federal food and drug laws and agreed to pay a $ 2 million fine. After a three-month trial that ended in February, a jury convicted <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, of 358 counts of violating the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Each count carried a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who oversaw the upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> manufacturing plant where the juice was made, was convicted of conspiracy, 18 counts of mail fraud and 429 counts of violating federal food and drug laws. Conspiracy and mail fraud carry maximum sentences of five years in prison. At the trial, the government introduced evidence to show that <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> bought adulterated and misbranded apple juice concentrate from two suppliers, who also pleaded guilty, and used this concentrate in apple juice and mixed apple products. Prosecutors said that <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> knew of the purchase of the bogus concentrate as early as 1978 and that <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON>, who became president in April 1981, knew of its use the previous January while he was still senior vice president in charge of marketing. Both defense attorneys, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Hoyvald </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimelman </PERSON> for <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>, had urged <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> to sentence their clients to probation and community service or home detention. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> had been punished by the loss of his position and loss of presitige brought about by extensive media coverage of the case. `` Alternative sentencing can achieve the desire of the system to punish,'' <PERSON> Kimelman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> declined to comment before sentencing. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the Eastern District of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he was satisfied that the sentences were a `` sufficient deterrent'' to other executives. He said economic fraud cases would continue to be a high priority, adding that `` a great effort went into fighting this major corporation with all its megabucks.'' Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Theurer </PERSON>, the current <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> president, said in a written statement said the company had invested $ 10 million in the last five years to ensure the quality of their products. `` Our products on the supermarket shelves today are pure,'' <PERSON> Theurer </PERSON> said. `` We know this because we test them every day.'' In May 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> settled a class-action suit involving the phony juice that was filed in federal court in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The company agreed to set up a $ 5 million cash fund for consumers and to provide $ 2.5 million in Beech-Nut and affiliated products to retailers.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Post Limit Gains For Third Straight Day</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto CX6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Corn futures prices soared the permissable daily limit Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> for the third consecutive session as fears of drought damage to the corn crop swelled. Soybean and oat futures also advanced on drought-related buying while wheat futures tumbled in response to a threat of reduced export sales. On other markets, livestock and meat futures were sharply higher; energy futures advanced; precious metals were lower; and stock-index futures retreated. The three corn contracts for 1988 delivery advanced the 15-cents-a-bushel daily limit as dry conditions prevailed in the parched Corn Belt. The near-month contract, for delivery in July, approached $ 3 a bushel for the first time since September 1984. But profit-taking limited the gains in soybean prices, and wheat futures fell sharply. `` I think this demonstrates the more serious concen about potential damage to corn than to the other crops,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was a lot of profit-taking'' in the soybean and wheat pits, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` People are very nervous.'' Experts say much of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn crop is in a critical growth stage and requires moisture within a week to avoid severe yield losses. The hardier and more recently planted soybeans can hold on a bit longer. Corn and soybean futures also were supported by ideas that the low water level in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the traditional grain-shipping route, could result in increased shipping of grains out of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Such a switch could reduce supplies of grains available for delivery against futures contracts on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. The sell-off in wheat futures was prompted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s statement early Thursday that export subsidy programs may be reviewed if the drought continues, analysts said. Traders sold wheat futures heavily despite <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s denial of any plans to reduce subsidized exports. Wheat settled 8 -LCB- cents to 15 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.79 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 15 cents higher with July at $ 2.94 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 10 cents higher with July at $ 2.89 \ a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents lower to 21 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 9.41 -LCB- a bushel Some livestock and meat futures rose the daily limit on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a sharp reversal of a week-long downtrend. In previous sessions, cattle and pork futures prices had fallen on ideas that high feed prices and dried-up pasture land would force livestock producers to reduce their herd sizes, putting more meat onto the market. Producers have now begun liquidating their herds, giving the futures markets a chance to rebound slightly, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Linnco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The cattle market faces a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> cattle-on-feed report Friday that is expected to show high numbers of cattle being fattened for slaughter. Live cattle settled .23 cent lower to 1.50 cents higher with June at 70.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to 1.40 cents higher with August at 72 cents a pound; hogs were .65 cent to 1.50 cents higher with June at 50.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to 2 cents higher with July at 45.10 cents a pound. Oil prices jumped sharply higher in late trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in response to market rumors that Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> had died, observers said. The rumors could not be confirmed. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .13 cent to .25 cent higher with July at $ 16.66 a barrel; heating oil was .37 cent to .70 cent higher with July at 44.12 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .35 cent to .96 cent higher with July at 50.19 cents a gallon. Gold and silver futures slipped a bit on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold settled $ 1.20 to $ 1.90 lower with August at $ 450.90 a troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cents to 1.5 cents lower with July at $ 7.14 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 4.60 points lower at 270.20.

 The stock market tumbled Thursday, mirroring a plunge in bond prices and eradicating gains in the previous two sessions that had put the Dow Jones average at a post-crash high. The key index of 30 industrial stocks, which climbed 32 points in the prior two trading days, plummeted 37.16 points to close at 2,094.24. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5-to-2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 435 issues up, 1,089 down and 425 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 161.55 million shares, up from 150.26 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 186.038 million shares. Analysts had said there was a natural tendency for some profit-taking to set in following the Dow average's impressive advance of late. But the day's decline was exacerbated by disarray in the credit markets, which were reacting to an unsubstantiated report in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> newspaper that indicated the central <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> might be tightening monetary policy. `` There are some indications that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> might be doing the same, and that says effectively that if the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> wants to keep the dollar stable, it will not give interest rates much room to decline,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year issue finished off 1 | points, or down more than $ 16 per $ 1,000 in face value `` There was profit-taking as expected, but investors were given a shove by the suggestion that monetary policy might be tightening in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Further pressuring the markets was a government report that showed operating rates at American factories, mines and utilities rose to 82.9 percent in May, the highest level in more than eight years. The report, well above market expectations, was interpreted as a sign that inflation may be lurking. Analysts fear a crack in investors' confidence, which has been building gradually, and described the drop as jolting. `` It just points out what thin ice we're on,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The Dow fell through the psychologically important 2,100-point level, a mark analysts had hoped would serve as a floor for a further advance. But lower stock prices also could bring out some bargain hunters. `` We would use any weakness as a buying opportunity,'' one trader said. Among actively traded issues, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> was down -RRB- at 49 -LCB-. The oil company, which will face <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> it its annual shareholders meeting Friday, announced a joint venture with a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> oil company. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was off \ at 43 \ The company said it will acquire <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s chemical division for $ 2.31 billion in cash. <ORGANIZATION> Intermedics </ORGANIZATION> jumped 7 to 42 \ The company agreed to be acquired by Swiss-based <ORGANIZATION> Sulzer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> for $ 43 a share, or about $ 800 million. Elsewhere, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 | to 117 -LRB-, <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> fell 2 at 46 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -LRB- to 83, and <PERSON> Smithkline </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON> was off 9 \ at 45 The pharmaceutical company predicted 1988 operating earnings will be below last year's levels. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market decreased in value by $ 35.833 billion, or 1.31 percent, from Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index fell 2.23 to 152.44. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 5.40 to 311.96, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index fell 4.68 to 269.77.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to nullify all federal court rulings since 1981 in <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5.7 billion patent infringement suit, claiming the presiding judge has a conflict of interest because her husband's late mother owned about $ 100,000 worth of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> stock. In a motion filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> called for the immediate disqualification of Judge <PERSON> Rya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> and dismissal of all of <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s rulings in the case since October 1981, including her 1985 decision that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> violated several Polaroid patents on instant camera and film. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> also recommended an award of less than $ 200 million `` would be more than ample to compensate Polaroid'' for any lost profits due to <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s line of instant cameras and film, which ceased production under a court order on Jan. 9, 1986. <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, Mass.-based Polaroid, however, has deemed the <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> motion meritless and noted that <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> ruled on Oct. 5, 1981 that her mother-in-law's ownership of the stock would not present a conflict. `` None of this is new to either side,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanes </PERSON>, who noted that <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> will likely file a counter motion. <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s husband, state <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Hiller </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>, was named executor of the estate of his mother, <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>, who died earlier this year and owned 2,250 <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> shares. The Zobels are both named as beneficiaries of <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s estate. `` Judge <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> and her husband have, through the estate, a financial interest in a party that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the litigation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> attorneys in the 28-page motion. The motion noted that <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s stock was worth as much as $ 150,000 in the past year. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> also claims <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> was in a position to `` substantially affect'' the value of Polaroid or <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> shares by her decisions. <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> will likely rule on the motion on July 6, the next scheduled pre-trial conference in the case, said <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Saab </PERSON>, a clerk for the judge. The trial for the damage award portion of the suit is scheduled to begin Jan. 9. In February, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> filed a $ 5.7 billion damage claim in the case, first filed in April 1976 after <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> began production of the line. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> has called the claim `` ludicrous and ridiculously inflated.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> reported $ 525 million in sales of instant cameras and film in 1981, according to the motion. After a five-month trial in 1985, <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> infringed on <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s patents and ordered <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> to stop producing the instant cameras and film. In the motion, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s decision forced <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> to fire or reassign about 800 workers and write off $ 494 million in losses. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in October 1986 refused to hear <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal of <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s decision <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> also argued in the motion that a sale of the shares would not be sufficient to eliminate the conflict. `` In the circumstances of this case, and given its high profile and potential significance to shareholders and employees of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> alike, there would inevitably be people who would question the impartiality of a judge who went to such lengths to remain on a case,'' said the motion.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is investigating <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s payment of more than $ 7 million to Korean businesses in connection with its attempts to sell its F-20 jet fighter to the Korean military, an official familiar with the case said Thursday. The criminal probe, which seeks to determine if the payments in 1984 through 1986 violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, is in its preliminary stages, said the official, who refused to be identified. The act bars <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies from making direct or indirect payments to foreign government officials. The investigation, first reported in Thursday's Wall Street Journal, apparently parallels a congressional committee inquiry into <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s payments to Korean companies that were made in connection with negotiations for sale of the fighter planes. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> is n't aware of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe, spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON> said Thursday at the company's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> headquarters. The company previously has portrayed itself as a victim of fraud by the Korean companies it dealt with, and has sued in <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> courts for return of its money. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> decided against buying the F-20, which <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> never put into production because of a lack of orders worldwide. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> said it invested $ 6.5 million in a <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> hotel venture as part of a legal `` offset'' agreement to demonstrate that in return for the jet contract, the company was willing to help boost the Korean economy. The probe by a subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> focuses on that payment, along with <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s payment of $ 1.5 million to terminate a lobbying agreement with a company controlled by the late Park Chong-kyu, a businessman well connected with the Korean government. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will investigate a secret agreement for <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> to pay as much as $ 55 million to Park's company if the lobbyist persuaded the Korean government to buy 200 of the fighter planes, sources told the Journal.

<HEAD>Major Japanese Retailer Suspends Sales Of South African Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ito-Yokado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a major Japanese supermarket chain, has suspended sales of South African products because of the country's apartheid policy, a company official said Thursday. `` The decision not to deal in South African products was made in view of the growing criticism in and outside the company'' against the nation's discriminatory policy of racial segregation, said <PERSON> Yasuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Takaha </PERSON>, spokesman for the company. As a result of the decision, sales of canned yellow peaches, canned fruit cocktail and a mixed fruit juice, all imported through a Japanese trading company, were suspended at the company's 133 stores across <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in April. <PERSON> Takaha </PERSON> said the decision was made during a company meeting in March, but the supermarket chain deliberately did not make a formal announcement. He said the products have been replaced with similar items from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Takaha </PERSON> also declined to provide sales figures for the two South African products. Ito-Yokado has sold the canned peaches since 1983 and the fruit cocktail since 1985. The move by the retailer comes at a time when <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is facing rising international criticism over its trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Last year, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> became <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest trading partner, surpassing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In dollar terms, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s two-way trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> rose 19 percent to $ 4.27 billion last year, according to preliminary Japanese figures. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> currently prohibits all direct investment by local companies in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, bans imports of South African iron and steel, and limits cultural, sports and tourism exchanges. It also bans sales of computers that might be used to enforce the apartheid system.

<HEAD>Former InterFirst Director To Plead Guilty To Bank Fraud</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former bank director <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Thursday he had agreed to plead guilty to a federal bank fraud charge stemming from $ 80 million in loans he had received from his bank several years ago. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> issued a statement saying he had agreed to plead guilty to a charge that he submitted false information to <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> as part of the administration of loans he had with the bank. Cited in the charges were the $ 80 million in loans, plus interest, that <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> repaid to <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION> in October 1987. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said a felony information filed Thursday in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> charged <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> with bank fraud. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Genderson </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> would enter the plea June 24. A sentencing date will be set then. `` In breaking the law, I have made a serious mistake,'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said in his statement. `` I have hurt my wife and children, our many loyal friends, and employees ... I am truly sorry that I have let all these people down.'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said collateral reports filed for continuation of the loans indicated more than 20,000 head of cattle as collateral when there actually were fewer than 5,000. Maximum punishment upon conviction is five years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>'s financial problems became public in July 1986 when the former <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> that later merged with <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to become <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION>, announced that <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>'s loans were in default. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> resigned as a director of the bank in June 1986. His father, a founding director of <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION> and for whom the <ORGANIZATION> Edwin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is named, resigned from the bank holding company's board in August 1986. <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION> at the same time announced a $ 281 million loss for the quarter and said it was preparing to make a provision for loan losses for that quarter of as much as $ 365 million. Bank officials at that time said a big part of the expected charge was from $ 80 million in loans, letters of credit and other credit <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> extended to <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION>. Between June 1986 and October 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 96 million in principal, interest and fees to the bank representing the full amount owed. <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> also is a cattle feeder in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> and a rancher in <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. In addition to announcing his planned guilty plea, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> also said he was resigning as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which he has chaired for five years.

 Within a week of his departure from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> went to work for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as a consultant to help the firm get defense contracts, sources said Thursday. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents seized records pertaining to <LOCATION> Paisley </LOCATION> when they searched <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offices as part of a massive fraud and bribery probe involving alleged corruption at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. The investigation involves court-authorized phone taps and bugs at <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s consulting office after he left the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, said other sources. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents also took from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office documents relating to the 404 and T-406 engines which <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>' unit, builds for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> began working as a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> consultant within a week after he left his <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> job last year, according to the sources. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was the assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for research, and engineering and systems. He had been recruited for the position in 1981 by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s boss. Former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that he was briefed about the fraud and bribery probe last fall and as a result of his briefings, `` It was clear that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was one of the central figures'' in the investigation. In addition, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said that 10 days before <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987, he had persuaded <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials to give him a contract as a consultant to the office he was leaving and he won approval to maintain his security clearance for access to information involving the military's most secret `` black programs.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> for a story in Friday's editions that he canceled <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s contract within days after taking office in April 1987 because `` it appeared to be a conflict of interest,'' and that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> received no fees for it. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, 63, a native of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, went to the Pentagon from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, where he was manager for international operations in the company's space and information division. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> is still a consultant for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> and the sources said his work involves lobbying efforts on behalf of engines built by the company's <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Whitney engine division. The 404 is being built for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F @ A-18 jet airplane, and the T-406 engine, a smaller engine which is being built for the V-22 Osprey, a vertical take-off jet that is being developed for both the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The Pentagon has awarded $ 316 million worth of 404 engine contracts to <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> in the past two years. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> originally had the chief contract to provide engines for the F-18, but the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, seeking to drive down costs, approached <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> two years ago and asked if the company could build engines for the plane. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, refused to confirm or deny <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s status as a consultant. `` We, as a matter of policy, do not confirm who consults with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bingman </PERSON> said in answer to questions. While he was in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was a key figure in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's naval build-up, which in turn was a centerpiece of the large increases in defense spending that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won during his first term after his 1980 campaign pledge to `` re-arm <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> worked with <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary for shipbuilding. `` Everything on the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s procurement side went through those three,'' said one congressional source Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
