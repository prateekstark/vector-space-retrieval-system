 A woman who admitted causing `` a lot of hurt and pain'' was convicted Thursday of kidnapping a baby from a hospital last summer and keeping him for four months. The Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s County jury deliberated an hour before reaching its verdict against <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Stancil-Lewis </PERSON>, 34, for the kidnapping of <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Thate </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stancil-Lewis </PERSON>, who stood silently as the verdict was ready, faces up to 30 years in prison for kidnapping, child abduction and false imprisonment when she is sentenced June 17. In an eight-page statement written by <PERSON> Stancil-Lewis </PERSON> and presented at trial, she said she saw the infant's mother on television pleading for his return, but she could n't give him back because she loved him. The boy, who was kidnapped in June when he was 3 weeks old, was found in <LOCATION> Stancil-Lewis </LOCATION><LOCATION> ' </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apartment Oct. 28. `` I took a sweet little baby boy,'' Detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Stancil-Lewis </PERSON> as saying as he read her statement in court. `` My heart went out to her,'' she wrote of the baby's mother, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Thate </PERSON>, adding she `` could n't give him back. I loved him, too.'' <PERSON> Stancil-Lewis </PERSON>, who had suffered a miscarriage shortly before the baby was abducted, recounted in her statement that she found <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> lying unattended in a hospital crib last June 11, smuggled him out of the hospital in a canvas sports bag and took him home. As the statement was read, Mrs. <PERSON> Thate </PERSON>, left the courtroom in tears. Seconds later, she was followed by her shaken husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thate </PERSON>. In the statement, <PERSON> Stancil-Lewis </PERSON> said: `` I caused this lady a lot of hurt and pain.'' She said she had begun thinking about giving the baby back to the <LOCATION> Hyattsville </LOCATION> couple. Prosecutors completed their case Wednesday after Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> called 10 witnesses to the stand. <PERSON> Stancil-Lewis </PERSON>' public defender, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, did not call any witnesses and did not have <PERSON> Stancil-Lewis </PERSON> testify on her own behalf.

 Radical students tossed up to five small explosive devices into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy compound after scaling the walls Friday during a demonstration, police said. Police said the devices exploded but did not cause any injuries or damage. Rioters fought police with rocks and firebombs Thursday after the funeral of a dissident student. They attacked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center and burned an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag in front of City Hall. The protesters demanded that President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government be removed and the 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> go home. About five students who climbed over the wall of the embassy in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> were arrested, police said. Two other students were arrested later when they rushed through the gates of the compound. Eyewitnesses said the devices that exploded appeared to be homemade. Radical students set off similar devices in February whey they briefly seized the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Protesters broke windows and hurled firebombs at the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> during clashes with riot police Thursday in the center of the city. Protesters burned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag as speakers denounced the government following a march Thursday by about 25,000 people to City Hall. When the crowd did not disperse, police fired tear gas from armored vans and about 5,000 riot police attacked. Student protesters fled into nearby streets and hurled firebombs at police that set fire to several shops and part of a subway station. Terrified pedestrian fled, many choking from thick clouds of tear gas. Skirmishes between police and protesters broke out around luxury hotels. Tourists looked on in astonishment or ran for cover. Gasoline bombs set a roof garden ablaze at the <LOCATION> Lotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> and fire trucks forced their way through the rioters to reach it. The street protests this week were the worst in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> since last summer, when demonstrations forced the government to agree to elections and democratic reforms. The Yonhap news agency said 32,000 people took part in anti-government protests Thursday at 34 places throughout <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, but its tabulation appeared incomplete. In the southern opposition stronghold of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> alone, about 100,000 people surged into the central district. Tens of thousands clashed with police. Police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> arrested 22 people during street battles after the funeral of dissident student <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung-man </PERSON>, who committed suicide Sunday in a protest against the government. `` Down with the military dictatorship!'' and `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>!'' the protesters in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> screamed, hurling rocks, bricks and firebombs. Dozens of windows were broken in attacks on City Hall and the nearby <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center. Gasoline bombs burst into flames amid squads of riot police during the struggle for control of the city's main shopping area. While street battles raged in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and elsewhere, <PERSON> Cho </PERSON>'s body was buried at a cemetery in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> after a five-hour procession that included stops for memorial services at his school in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and home in <LOCATION> Chonju </LOCATION>, another southern city. The funeral procession in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, which police did not try to stop, moved through the center of the capital, snarling traffic in the morning rush hour. `` Down with the murder regime!'' marchers shouted as others in white mourning clothes beat drums and cymbals. Singers chanted dirges and students in white performed a ghost dance. `` We will never end our struggle until we destroy <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s regime! one young woman shouted. Protests began Tuesday to honor <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> and mark the eighth anniversary, on Wednesday, of the 1980 <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising in which at least 191 people were killed. In <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, 100,000 people packed a major traffic circle for a rally demanding a full accounting of the uprising. Thousands of riot police fired tear gas, starting hours of street battles. Protesters shouted `` Execute <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' and `` Unite the motherland by driving out <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. imperialists!'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> helped his fellow army general <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> seize power in 1980 and succeeded him as president in February. Opposition groups in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> say both men should be held responsible for the harsh military suppression of the 1980 revolt.

<HEAD>Car Dealership Sues Golf Course After Errant Swings Damage Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The owners of a car dealership that sells expensive sports cars are teed off about their neighbors, a miniature golf course where they say some players take too-hefty swings. Golf balls have been clearing a 30-foot-high net between <LOCATION> Golfland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motorsport </ORGANIZATION> for years, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON>, the car dealership's general manager. But the last straw, he said, was when a brass putter also flew over the fence and smashed the windshield of a Porsche 911 convertible. The putter, which also scratched a Porsche 928 on the rebound, caused $ 3,000 in damage, <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> said. As a result, the dealership filed a lawsuit Tuesday against <ORGANIZATION> Golfland </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. It asks for unspecified damages, contending <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motorsport </ORGANIZATION> has suffered thousands of dollars in losses because of the errant golfers. The manager on duty at <LOCATION> Golfland </LOCATION> on Wednesday referred phone calls to owner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, who could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Geri </PERSON>, said Wednesday the couple had not seen the lawsuit, but added that they had done everything possible to prevent balls from going onto adjacent property. <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> believes most of the wayward balls come from a hole where golfers must hit up a ramp to reach the cup. `` They must treat the hole like they're on a driving range,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Strong gains by radicals in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliamentary elections signal even greater militancy against the West and more state control of the economy Results from the second round of voting Friday confirmed the advantage radicals gained in the first round five weeks earlier. There were reports of violence in some cities during the bitterly contested election. The breakdown of the new 270-seat parliament between the power blocs is not yet known, but announced results show radicals clearly in the ascendancy after a prolonged struggle with conservatives in the leadership. Parliament has had little say in foreign policy, but Western analysts believe the new radical strength will affect foreign relations, conduct of the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the course of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist Shiite Moslem revolution They feel the radical gains, at a time of increasing political uncertainty and military setbacks, herald a tougher stand against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accuse <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the war, which began in September 1980. `` The Iranians will likely prosecute the war more vigorously. They're already rethinking their strategy, which was based on attrition,'' <PERSON> Hans-Heino </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON> said in an interview from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` But much will depend on how quickly they can improve the economy,'' <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON> said. `` This is their first priority. If they can get credit abroad, to get more military hardware as well as alleviate domestic hardship, they will be more aggressive.'' New alliances that have emerged in the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hierarchy are sure to affect the struggle over who will run the country after the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the 87-year-old revolutionary patriarch. He has named <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein-Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, 66, as his successor. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> has no significant power base, however, and is opposed by such key figures as <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the parliament speaker, who regularly leads Friday prayers at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> is expected to become a figurehead, with real power held by <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and two or three others. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who is allied with the radicals on several issues, scored a personal triumph in the election by winning 1.3 million votes. Other radical winners include <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Salamati </PERSON>, former agriculture minister; <PERSON> Hojatoleslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharroubi </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Pilgrimage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> and is believed to have directed riots last year in the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ateqe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sediqi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajai </PERSON>, widow of President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajai </PERSON>. Leftist opponents of the <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> regime assassinated <PERSON> Rajai </PERSON> in 1981. Of 208 incumbents who ran, only about 100 were re-elected to the new Majlis, as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament is known. Its term is four years. The main group of conservative clerics, the <ORGANIZATION> Militant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clergy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, was weakened just before the elections when a radical faction led by <PERSON> Kharroubi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pilgrimage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> broke away over political and economic issues. Diplomatic sources with contacts in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said the split was encouraged by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and the prosecutor-general, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoeiniha </PERSON>, a leader of the `` followers of the Imam's line'' who stormed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in November 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. <PERSON> Serajeddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousavi </PERSON>, a cleric who heads the security apparatus, said in the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION>: `` Being in a state of war and at this sensitive juncture, we must not allow a bunch of obstructionists to waste parliament's time.'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> spent years playing referee between the rival factions, but moved clearly to the radical side before the elections. He decreed wider state powers, opening the way for economic reforms that were blocked by the conservative-dominated Council of Guardians. The council can veto legislation it decides is a violation of Islamic tenets. Since the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> was overthrown in February 1979, the radicals have sought to nationalize industry and trade, distribute land held by wealthy families and liberalize social laws. Conservatives, supported by the merchant class, advocate a more capitalist economy. `` The radicals' success is significant because it gives impetus to their efforts to achieve state control not just of the economy, but the whole revolutionary apparatus,'' <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON> said. A major radical figure to emerge recently is Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali-Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, former ambassador to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Western Intelligence agencies have linked him closely to Shiite extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> who kidnapped Westerners and carried out suicide bomb attacks. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> told <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> in June 1985 after two Americans were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Shortly before that, <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> lost his right eye and two fingers of his right hand when he opened a booby-trapped parcel in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> claimed the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> sent it. As interior minister, <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> was in charge of the elections. Several months ago he replaced 20 provincial governors, who are responsible for screening candidates. He became interior minister in August, replacing <PERSON> Ali-Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nategh-Nouri </PERSON>, conservative head of the Hojati Islamic faction. <PERSON> Nategh-Nouri </PERSON> did not win a majority in his <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> district in the first election round April 8, but made it May 13.

 <PERSON> Pines </PERSON> dot snowy peaks outside as <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinard </PERSON> sits in his rustic office in a peach cowboy shirt, crusading to carve away 90 percent of the nation's largest county to create <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. At 18,160 square miles of mostly desert north of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> mountains, the new county would still be the nation's largest, bigger than <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> combined. Both it and what remained of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> would have better-focused government if voters agree to a `` divorce'' by passing Measure A, said <PERSON> Pinard </PERSON>, who publishes a local newspaper from this 6,000-foot-high ski resort town. His allies gathered 15,000 signatures to get the issue on the June 7 ballot. If approved by a majority vote, <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> would begin operating after a Board of Supervisors is elected in November. Four-fifths of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s 1.1 million residents are jammed into the far eastern edge of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> megalopolis, and <PERSON> Pinard </PERSON> says they deserve a county government that concentrates on urban woes: air and water pollution, gangs, gridlock. But the 205,000 people in the proposed new county confront other problems. The area encompasses military and Indian preserves, mining regions, wilderness, a slice of <LOCATION> Death </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> resorts and the mountains near <LOCATION> Wrightwood </LOCATION>. `` You come up over the mountains and you have people with an entirely different set of problems,'' said <PERSON> Pinard </PERSON>, who would like to be elected a <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> supervisor. `` We've got snow; they've got gutters and curbs. Residents of such <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> basin cities as <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> are `` just not conscious of our concerns,'' he said. But opponents of the `` divorce'' contend a new, 2,000-square-mile <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> would really be `` <LOCATION> Podunk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' the second-smallest in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, stripped of money and influence. They belittle promises by <PERSON> Pinard </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of more efficient and responsive government, better roads and law enforcement. Opponents say it instead would skirt bankruptcy from the outset, with too little industry for its size. Its far-flung voters would be unlikely to approve bonds to fund a jail, hospitals or other public works; and services would suffer, they contend. `` They say <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> government is too fat and unresponsive, and maybe that's true,'' said <PERSON> Nelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wrightwood </LOCATION>, coordinator of the NO on Mojave committee. `` But I think we should work at changing it before jumping off a cliff.'' A key point of contention is a report by a special governor's commission that found <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to be economically feasible, with an $ 88,000 surplus on a yearly budget of more than $ 137 million, assuming current service levels The commission, mandated by law after Measure A qualified, sketched a division of assets and liabilities and organization of the new county. It said current <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> employees would be able to work for Mojave with no cuts in pay or benefits. As part of the settlement, it said, the old county would owe the new $ 11.8 million, to be paid in three yearly payments. But late last month, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisors sued, contending the study failed to account for unfunded pension liabilities that would mean the new, smaller <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> would be owed as much as $ 33.6 million by <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> ruled May 11 that he had no authority to invalidate the proposal. The supervisors' appeal will not be heard until after the election. Most of the proposed county now is represented by Supervisor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON>, who cast the sole vote against filing the suit. <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON>, who is running for re-election against a former aide, has not said how he will vote on the measure. If <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is created, <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON>'s district would be reduced to most of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, including the Big Bear and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arrowhead </LOCATION> resorts, and the <LOCATION> Morongo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> desert area. <PERSON> Pinard </PERSON> said he had believed odds for passage of Measure A were slightly better than 50-50; but with the supervisors' suit, he said, `` I just do n't know _ the chances have to be revised downward.''

<HEAD>Man Getting Wish Posthumously: A Piano Dropped From The Sky</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In his lifetime, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> had a secret wish, an unusual fantasy: He wondered what an airborne piano would sound like crashing to earth. Now, a bit late, his friends will find out. The <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> man was 44 when he died three years ago, leaving an $ 800,000 estate. In his will, <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, whose life was full of adventure and fun-loving behavior, left $ 15,000 to three buddies who were instructed to toss one last party for their departed friend. The professional guitar player told his friends to `` give a party for themselves and as many of my friends as they can find that desire to attend.'' As told by <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s friends, the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> native moved to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area in 1972. He sang Delta blues and found time to be a parachutist, pilot, storyteller and business success with six furniture stores. It took three years to straighten out <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s will, and on May 28, hundreds of folks are expected to gather for the memorial celebration. They will indulge Young's strange fantasy _ listening to a 300-pound piano crash to the ground from a hovering helicopter. `` He talked about that all the time,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 53, a <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> graphic designer who met Young in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anselmo </LOCATION> saloon 10 years ago. `` He'd sit here and say, ` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, we've got to have a piano drop. Can you hear it? ... You take an old upright piano about 1,000 feet in the sky ...''' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> mused over that, and added fondly, `` ... I think he'll be able to hear it.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said a helicopter will drop an inlaid walnut upright from 50 to 100 feet near <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` It's an arrogant, outrageous, playful, childish thing to do,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. `` That embodies J.C.'' About four hours after the smash, the celebration will turn to a more sedate mood with food, drink and music in <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION>. Friends said the sendoff fits in with <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s life. He once drove a motorcycle into a bar and ordered a beer with an olive. However, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was far from a clown. He had a master's degree in mathematics, and often dragged bar patrons into conversations about negative numbers and mind-twisting theorems. His death was as unusual as his life. His body was discovered in his black Cadillac in a ravine below a steep highway near <LOCATION> Stinson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Authorities said he may have been beaten to death. `` He was full of life and I miss him,'' said real estate broker <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Catlett </PERSON>, who met young in a bar in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1972.

<TEXT>
 The Big Three automakers are replacing their crash diets of the early'80s with more lasting changes to prepare for challenge of the next decade: overproduction. By 1990 there could be 5.6 million more new cars and trucks than buyers worldwide, according to industry estimates. `` First, obviously, cost-cutting was the major concern ... But in the long term it's the products they're coming out with'' that will determine who survives, said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Having modernized their factories and corporate structures, the Big Three are marshaling their resources with the aim of making American cars that are better engineered and sell like Japanese cars. The dollar's slide against the Japanese yen and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies two years ago has made some imports more expensive and temporarily helped level the playing field for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. So has a new <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> pattern contract that stresses job security over wage increases and gives the companies needed flexibility. The auto industry tumult of the past 15 years _ fuel crises, a recession and the shock of Japanese entry _ has given way to a more stable market where winners and losers no longer are determined by national origin. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, losing $ 1 million a day at the beginning of the decade, has made big adjustments already, closing excess plants and running the rest on overtime while grabbing styling leadership from <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> with a sleek, aerodynamic new lineup. `` People who go into a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> dealership have a car in mind. They say ` I want that Thunderbird, Taurus, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>','' <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> said. `` People are not doing that for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. ... They're going to a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> dealer and saying: ` I've got $ 13,000. What can I get?''' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> led <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers in earnings in 1986 and went on to set the world auto industry record with $ 4.6 billion in 1987 profits and again with $ 1.6 billion in earnings in the first quarter of 1988. It also has a comfortable $ 10 billion cash cushion it is saving for a major electronics acquisition. At its annual meeting last week, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said the second largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker has no intention of giving up its edge and will substantially increase spending on new product development over the next few years. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, under Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, also has switched its focus from trimming costs to investing in new products. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> had been shedding weight gained in its August acquisition of ailing <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. After squeezing more Jeeps out of a former <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> decided to close <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION>'s other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assembly plant, in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, by year's end It also settled its <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> contract five months early, eliminating the chance of a costly strike in September when its factories will be pushing out 1989 models. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy of aggressive pricing to gain market share at the expense of immediate profits has boosted sales during 1988, including a 72 percent jump for Jeeps and a 55 percent increase for minivans. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, who faces his shareholders Thursday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, already has injected extra money into research and development for new models and advanced engineering this year and plans more. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, which spent $ 50 billion since the early 1980s to modernize or replace its factories, is also channeling resources into new product development, but analysts say it has more problems to solve. The world's largest automaker is barely breaking even on its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car and truck business despite cost-cutting, which may make additional plant closings necessary. Analysts also question Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s pledge to regain lost market share. To move eight points to 45 percent of the market, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> would have to increase sales by at least 1.2 million cars and trucks a year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> lost market share in 1986 to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> as well as to foreign makers. And the field of competitors only grows thicker. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, which joined the ranks of Japanese makers with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants, has sold out its <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> plant's production through October. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s huge <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> plant will begin making Camry sedans this summer and a Chrysler-Mitsubishi plant in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> soon will be churning out sporty 1989 models.

<HEAD>Why The Seers Say `Bah, Humbug' To Strong Economy</HEAD>

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for March improved beyond all expectations, many economists and big investors responded with a chorus of `` Bah, humbug.'' Funny they should pan what would seem like fabulous news. But they've done it before and most likely they'll do it again. They responded that way to news of a lower jobless rate, to increases in factory use, even to the dollar's new stability. It is a strange, discomfiting world in which good is bad, happy is sad, up is down, square is round, best is worst, last is first, strong is weak, bottom is peak, rich is poor and less is more. And if the sages are being spooked by the `` good'' news _ news for which they've waited months and which they deemed necessary for economic survival _ it's no wonder they're exaggerating `` bad'' news, of which they've found plenty. Late last year, for instance, the pessimists said consumers would reduce spending, forcing the economy into recession. It did n't happen. Then they said an inventory glut might produce recession in 1988. But the glut disappeared. `` It is ironic that the pessimistic crowd see a boom just as bloated inventories are starting to cool things off,'' said economist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> investment firm, who fears neither a boom nor a bust. Throughout, there has been wide disagreements among economists, some of whom believed the biggest threat was from recession, others that inflation would turn out to be the big problem. Whatever the interpretation, however, the conclusion has been the same, i.e., bad news. If the economy expanded it would strain production facilities and produce inflation. Should expansion cease, recession would follow. The dramatic improvement in the nation's trade deficit _ a $ 4 billion reduction to $ 9.7 billion in March _ provides the most vivid example of the syndrome. Nothing economic has been more eagerly awaited in recent months, since a shrinkage of the deficit means <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods, especially manufactured items, are becoming more competitive abroad. In fact, many economists and investors made the latest trade figures the fulcrum of their analyses. When the deficit grew in February, the stock market plunged. Would a gain in March make the market rise? It did n't happen. Once again the news, though opposite to that of February, produced a negative reaction. Both the bond and stock markets interpreted the news as indicative of an economy about to overheat and produce inflation. `` It seems the better things get, the worse they're going to be,'' quipped <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, the publisher, who was addressing a business luncheon group shortly after hearing the news. Why the mood? Economists themselves have been asking that question, and most have defended their positions with data and theories that to the layman seem thorough, reasonable and even sagacious. While recognizing that pessimism may be justified _ and that inflation, high interest rates and perhaps recession lie ahead _ some economists believe there is a large psychological element involved. In fact, with so many disproportions and dislocations in the economy _ big budget and trade deficits, uncollectable Third World loans, and the crash of the securities markets in October _ no matter how poor or inaccurate an analysis might be, a negative forecast stands a chance of being correct. There are also the awful memories of the 1970s to contend with. Economists back then could n't believe what was happening _ that inflation and interest rates were not just high but in the double digits. They can not forget. And, finally, anxiety is produced by the very expansion itself. Now in its 66th month, it has lived far beyond the usual lifespan of expansions, and inevitably will turn down. But when? And will inflation or recession end it? <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Ladenburg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thalmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a securities broker-dealer, remains optimistic, at least about inflation. He notes that major inflation indicators rose less in the first quarter of 1988 than in the final quarter of 1987. His forecast contrasts with that of most economists. `` We're convinced that with just a little bit of luck, the expansion could continue into 1991 or 1992,'' he says, adding the caveat: `` However, this will be a respite, not a reprieve. If <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> can not deal with its problems -LRB- mainly the budget deficit -RRB-, we will all have to live with the consequences.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and his supporters see him as a courageous, outspoken fighter now taking unfair shots from those who can not accept him as the first black federal judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, whose impeachment hearing began Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has been battling bribery and conspiracy charges for the last seven years. But he has remained a popular figure in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s black community, which has held impassioned demonstrations in his support and contributed $ 65,000 to his legal defense. `` He's never been the kind to back down from a fight; he's had to pull himself up from his bootstraps from day one,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> dentist and longtime friend who helped raise funds for <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. `` Most federal judges are the placating type, but <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> speaks out _ he's a maverick.'' The flamboyant <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> has proclaimed his innocence ever since he was indicted on bribery charges in 1981 and then acquitted two years later. The case did n't end there. Fellow judges accused <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of obstructing justice and lying under oath, and issued a report recommending his impeachment. `` I'm not going to be impeached and I'm not going to be removed,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` It's pure unadulterated politics.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, in sermon-like speeches around the country, has blasted the secret judicial investigation after his acquittal as a `` witchhunt'' and an unconstitutional `` throwback to Star Chamberism.'' He has suggested his race has had something to do with the effort against him, and said he really angered <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials with his 1981 rulings blocking deportation of Haitian immigrants. Complaints were filed against him in 1984 for his alleged improper political statements, including harsh criticism of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said his position on the federal bench does not mean he ca n't speak his mind. `` I do n't have any organized effort,'' said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who added he has also spent much of his own money. `` It's draining me financially. It's impacting me from an emotional standpoint _ I'm tired from all this mess. His 70-year-old mother <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON>, with whom <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, 51, has shared a <LOCATION> Lauderhill </LOCATION> apartment since his second divorce, said her son would come out of the hearings fine and `` he does n't need me to talk for him.'' The only child of a maid and butler in <LOCATION> Altamonte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, a small town north of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hastngs </PERSON> earned his law degree at predominantly black <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> A & amp; <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, became a civil rights leader, and ran unsuccessfully for office several times. In 1970, he was the first black man to run for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but failed to win nomination. He returned to his private law practice, where he did much free work in civil rights cases, until 1979, when President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> appointed him to the federal bench.

 Federal law officers searched Wednesday for any `` shred of evidence'' that might link a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> couple charged with plotting to kill presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to violent white supremacist groups. <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 30, and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, were in custody on charges of conspiring to kill <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, threatening an informer and possessing an automatic rifle. A Secret Service agent testified at a hearing Tuesday that agents had taped a conversation in which <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord was planning the assassination of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` We are out seeking every shred of evidence and talking to every person we can who might know something,'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Wednesday. The Secret Service is responsible for protecting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday found a bullet under a seat in the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign plane. But <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> later said it was determined the 9mm bullet belonged to the Secret Service. `` It's one of ours,'' he said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, suggested that comments by some public officials had helped set the stage for the alleged plot against him. He was apparently referring to strong criticism of him during the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary campaign by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who at one point said Jews would have to be `` crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` The climate for this kind of antagonism and violence, of course, has been set by many irresponsible public leaders -LRB- whose -RRB- attacks based on race have set a divisive and dangerous climate, such as the one ... in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in April, for example,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Den </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouden </PERSON>, the agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office, located in an area that has become known for attracting members of extremist groups, said he had done some checking into the Williamses background and found no evidence the pair belonged to The Order or CSA Papers filed in federal court indicated <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told an informer that he was a member of The Order and other white supremacist groups and that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was to be killed. A <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> television station, <ORGANIZATION> KSDK </ORGANIZATION>, reported that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had telephoned from jail on Wednesday to say he had not been involved in any plot against the Democratic presidential contender. `` I did not conspire to kill the man,'' the station quoted <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> as saying. `` If <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> makes it to the presidency, well, fine.'' And in an interview with the <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> -RRB- News-Democrat, published in Thursday's editions, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> admitted he is a racist but said he is not affiliated with any group. `` If there was a crime done, I've done it all on my own,'' he told the newspaper in a telephone interview from jail on Wednesday. `` I deny that there is a crime done. I did not conspire with anyone to kill any presidential candidate, especially <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I do have prejudices ... against anything that is n't white,'' he added. Lawyers for the couple said each denied belonging to a white supremacist group. And after the hearing Tuesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said as she was escorted out of the courtroom: `` We're not part of the CSA.'' According to the criminal complaint filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, an unidentified person contacted the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office earlier this month, claiming that the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> were conspiring to assassinate <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The information was relayed to the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and agents met with the informant, who agreed to wear a hidden microphone and meet again May 10 with <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, this time with law enforcement officials listening in, the complaint said. The complaint said the informant later received a death threat from the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> for informing on them. At the hearing, <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> testified that the informant led sheriff's deputies to a wooded area in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> where they found an AR-15 Colt semi-automatic rifle and a bag the informant said belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION>. The complaint said the bag contained a postcard addressed to <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and maps, one of which had his fingerprints. The rifle had been reported stolen from <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, according to the agent. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said that during the recorded conversation with the informant, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he wanted to get the rifle back because it had been issued to him by the CSA. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> also said the organization wanted it returned because it had been used to kill a law enforcement officer, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said that the informant brought up the assassination plot during the conversation and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said `` the <ORGANIZATION> CSA </ORGANIZATION> was planning to assassinate candidate <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the Fourth of July.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said that after the <PERSON> Williamses </PERSON> were arrested, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told authorities about the individual who provided him with the rifle and also made statements about a plan to kill <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Northcutt </PERSON> testified that he had interviewed Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> after her arrest. At that time, she said she was present when her husband discussed the CSA and other groups. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination and has been the target of hundreds of death threats in his 1984 and 1988 campaigns, said Wednesday he would not be deterred. `` We will not surrender to the dream-busters,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The Secret Service will handle the dream-busters, and I will keep -LRB- articulating -RRB- the dream and keep hope alive.'' The Williamses were being held without bond in the federal detention facility in <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Records in <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> show <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> were both arrested in Ozark Dec. 7, 1986. He was charged with unlawful use of a weapon and she was charged with possession of marijuana. Both ended up serving short sentences in the <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail and are on probation, according to records.

<HEAD>Admission Review Can Cut Hospital Costs 8 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Insurance companies can cut medical expenses 8 percent if they require people to get approval from a review board before being treated in the hospital, says a study published today. Such `` utilization review'' progams are intended to hold down medical expenses by checking to make sure hospitalization is necessary. The study found that the controls save money, although it did not determine whether they have any effect on health. Utilization review programs generally require that hospital admissions be approved by a review panel before or at the time of admission. The study, directed by Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, was published in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and was based on a review of 222 groups of employees and dependents who were covered by a large private insurance company that required utilization review. The study concluded that utilization review reduced hospital admissions by 12 percent and total medical expenditures by 8 percent. For a typical company with 1,000 employees, this could mean saving $ 636,000 over five years, the study said. For a similar company with a high rate of hospital use, the savings could total $ 2.2 million.

<HEAD>`Massive Blackouts' on Cable TV Predicted from New Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's cable television subscribers will face `` massive blackouts'' in service under a new federal policy allowing local stations to buy exclusive rights to syndicated programs, cable industry officials say. Under the policy approved 3-0 by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, cable TV systems that broadcast the same programs in a local station's viewing area will have to black out the shows or substitute other programs. Some in the cable industry are predicting dark screens and the demise of some TV superstations as a result. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns nationally distributed <ORGANIZATION> WTBS </ORGANIZATION>, said the new rules `` do not give the cable industry a realistic chance to avoid massive blackouts.'' <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said the new rules will result in less duplication of programs and will provide an incentive to produce new programs. `` Blackouts will only occur if cable operators seek to cause turmoil for short-term political advantage, which I can not believe they will do,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said it will challenge the rules in court. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> pulled the plug on the favorite TV programs of millions of people,'' <ORGANIZATION> NCTA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> said. `` People whose favorite programs disappear will be angered and bewildered'' and the cost of syndicated programming will rise, he added. The rules will likely reduce how often TV viewers can see syndicated reruns of shows like `` M-A-S-H,'' `` Taxi'' and `` My Three Sons.'' A cable subscriber now can see one of these shows several times a day if it is aired by a local broadcaster and by out-of-town superstations whose signals are carried by the local cable operator. `` The rule of reruns is what prevails today,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said. He said that by giving broadcasters a measure of programming protection, the rules will increase the value of their programs to advertisers. More ad revenue, in turn, will foster production of new programs, he said. In addition, cable systems will be forced to be come up with more programming, he said. He also said cable systems should not have to resort to blackouts to comply with the rules because of a one-year transition period, a variety of exceptions that will be allowed and the amount of substitute programming that is available, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said. But the cable industry expects that at least some screens will go dark and that some of the smaller TV superstations may return to being just local stations. That view was expressed by <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Treeman </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, Okla.-based cable carrier that distributes superstation signals including WGN. He said cable systems in some large markets, where independents can afford to buy exclusive rights to programming, may have to black out or substitute shows for as much as 40 percent of a superstation's programming `` That's enough for the cable operator to drop the signal,'' he said. Similar rules were dropped by the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in 1980. Since then, cable systems have been able to carry the signals of out-of-town stations such as <ORGANIZATION> WTBS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WWOR </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area and <ORGANIZATION> WGN </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which have become known as superstations, even when those stations transmit programs whose rights were bought by a local TV station. Superstations also have become popular for the local sporting events they carry. Under the new exclusivity rules, TV stations will be able to negotiate for exclusive rights to a syndicated program and will be able to force a cable system to honor that contract by blacking out that show when it is aired by a superstation on the system. The rules also allow broadcasters to negotiate rights with cable systems. Superstations also will be able to buy exclusive rights for syndicated shows on a nationwide basis. The rules wo n't apply to cable systems with fewer than 1,000 subscribers. About half of all cable systems fall into this category, though they serve only about 5 percent of the nation's 45 million cable subscribers, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Swap Of Downtown Real Estate For
Swampland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are split over whether a proposed swap of 92.5 U.S.-owned acres in downtown <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> for 118,000 acres of swampland in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is fair to taxpayers, but the committee approved the arrangement. `` This is a good deal ... everybody wins,'' says longtime <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, D-Ariz., who helped put the proposal together Strongly disagreeing is Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., an Interior subcommittee chairman who is first in line to eventually succeed <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> as chairman and who normally is aligned with <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> on issues before the panel <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> says the deal could find taxpayers trading the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> acreage for `` a bargain basement price'' because nobody knows just how much the property will be worth when it is rezoned for commercial development. <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> on Wednesday had the clout that normally flows to a chairman, easily winning voice-vote approval for legislation authorizing completion of what <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> says would be the biggest interstate land trade in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The proposed deal involves the 104-acre site that now houses the <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a federal facility that is slated to close next month. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> says the property is one of the most valuable undeveloped urban tracts in the West. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appraisal values the parcel at $ 122 million. On the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> end are 118,000 acres owned by the <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> family, although <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> says that 4,236 of them are under tidal water and possibly owned by the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. This land would be used to enlarge the Big Cypress National Preserve and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panther refuge in the southwest part of the state, but the government would not own the subsurface mineral rights. The deal worked out by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> congressional delegation values the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> land at $ 45.1 million. The proposal also calls for the <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> family to pay the government $ 34.9 million. Under the plan, the Colliers would get 68 of the 104 acres in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. The city of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> would be given 20 acres for a park and the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> 11.5 to expand a hospital, with the state of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> possibly getting the other 4.5 acres. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> challenged the appraisal on the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> property, citing a report by the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> that says the real value of the land wo n't be known until the 68 acres are rezoned for commercial use. By a 36-3 vote, he lost an attempt to amend the bill to delay completion of the deal until after <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> substantially completed the rezoning process, new appraisals were submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> ruled that what the government was getting was equal to what it was trading away. `` My intention is to make this exchange look a little more like a business transaction,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` We owe this to the taxpayers. ... There is no private individual who would get rid of these lands under these circumstances.'' <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> and other supporters argued that the legislation could bring a higher price for the 68 acres because it requires the tract to be offered to the highest bidder once rezoning is completed. Under the plan, the <ORGANIZATION> Colliers </ORGANIZATION> could get the land by matching the high bid. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, however, that there is little likelihood another buyer could quickly put together the financial package to satisfy the bill's requirement that the buyer pay cash for the property within 30 days of the bidding. Defending the legislation, Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said that `` it's a good package for what we're all trying to do. Forget the value of the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> land. ... We're not in the moneymaking business.''

<HEAD>Poor, Elderly Would Cash Government Checks At Any Bank Under

 Banks should be required to cash government checks for the elderly and the poor even if they have no accounts with the financial institutions, an advocacy group told lawmakers. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Wednesday that people on Social Security and welfare would be willing to pay a fee of $ 2 for the check cashing service by banks, even though legislation does not call for it. Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> provided the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on consumer affairs with statistics showing that check cashing outlets, including liquor stores, often charge exorbitant fees for the service because of the unwillingness of banks to provide it. She said check cashing outlets and unlicensed community locations often charge as high as 20 percent to 30 percent for personal checks, 10 percent for money orders and 6 percent for government checks. `` They can do so because they are vendors of last resort,'' she said. `` Many of their customers, including our elderly, have no where else to go.'' Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said her group supported legislation introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, which would require banks to cash government checks of customers with no accounts once their identification has been verified. August <PERSON> Zinsser </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told the committee that the legislation would subject banks to large fraud losses and `` is premature, inappropriate and unfair to depository institutions.'' Proponents of the legislation, including Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, denied that fraud would be a problem. Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said currently 54,000 government checks out of 482 million are forged each year. `` This represents less than the normal bounce level of all checks cashed in banks,'' she said. Another witness, assistant Comptroller General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, released a prelimary report done by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> which indicates that Social Security and welfare recipients in the nation's urban areas have the most difficulty cashing their government checks in banks where they have no accounts. He said: `` The unbanked population of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is at the lower end of the income scale, relies relatively heavily on government benefit programs, includes a significant percentage of the unemployed, and most have 12 years or less of education. `` Some individuals do not have depository accounts and are not able to cash their checks at local banks or thrifts,'' <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Study Says Higher Standards Needed To Improve State `Safety Nets'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government needs to set higher standards for state poverty programs so that the assistance available to poor people wo n't vary so widely from state to state, a private research group says. At the same time, states need to do more on their own to improve programs for the disadvantaged, said the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The center, which analyzes government spending and its impact on the poor from a liberal perspective, reported Wednesday that most states fail to provide adequate `` safety nets'' for the poor. The center's report, `` Holes in the <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nets </ORGANIZATION>,'' found broad differences among the states in the quality of assistance provided to the poor. It concluded that shortcomings exist in all regions of the country and even in some states with sound economies and above-average personal income. `` The extent of variations in state poverty policies makes a strong case for an enhanced federal role, both in setting standards and providing funds,'' the researchers said. `` Assistance to many poor families would not then depend so much on where in this nation they happen to live.'' But center Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said that because budget constraints probably will prevent sweeping changes at the federal level, `` we believe that the principal choices made in determining the quality of the state safety nets are likely to be those made in each state capital.'' `` To narrow some of these holes in the safety net, state action is crucial,'' he said. The center studied government programs that provide cash, medical and other assistance to the poor, and found that none of the states nor the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> met all 10 standards in a `` reasonable adequacy'' test developed by the center. Twenty-nine states meet three or fewer of the criteria, including <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which meet none; just 14 states meet more than half the criteria, including <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, which did the best by meeting nine of the 10. The study found, for example: _ In 32 states, maximum benefits from Aid to Families with Dependent Children are below half the poverty line for a family of three with no other income _ Twenty-eight states impose state income taxes on working families living below the poverty line, and 10 tax the income of families living below half the poverty line _ In 26 states, fewer than one in three jobless workers received unemployment insurance in an average month in 1986 <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> told reporters that some of the states that are the most stingy with benefits `` turn around and extract significant amounts of the income of poor families through the tax system in their states.'' He said that because the assistance gaps are present in all regions of the country and in states with both low and high personal income, `` this indicates that really you're talking about political questions'' in determining benefits. `` I think what you're seeing reflected ... on the most part is the political weakness ... of low-income families,'' <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said. Here is a breakdown of which states met how many standards in the 10-point adequacy test: _ Zero: <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ One: <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> _ Two: <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> _ Three: <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> _ Four: <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ Five: <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> _ Six: <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ Seven: <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ Eight: <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> _ Nine: <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is launching a counterattack against his critics and telling conservative senators he wo n't resign in the absence of evidence of wrongdoing. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s private lawyers said Wednesday that a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee report is `` seriously wrong'' in accusing <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> of violating a White House policy by assisting scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s counselor at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, claimed that subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> had n't given the panel's members an opportunity to vote on the report. In response, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said: `` The report was circulated to every member of the subcommittee for comment. ... Release of the report was approved by the subcommittee members.'' The report issued earlier this month says that then-White House counselor <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his deputy violated a White House policy barring contacts with procurement officials, resulting in favoritism toward <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s private attorneys, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, said the subcommittee report was incorrect because the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> policy permits contacts with procurement agencies when the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has a legitimate interest in information about procurement matters. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had campaigned in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, area where <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was located and had expressed an interest in promoting jobs in the area. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who has been conducting a criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and other matters, is expected to issue a report in several weeks raising ethical questions about the attorney general's behavior, sources familiar with the investigation have said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told seven conservative <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators on Wednesday that if he resigned now it would be an admission of guilt when there is no evidence he has done anything wrong, congressional sources said. The attorney general made the comment after being asked by one of the conservative senators whether he had weighed the possibility of quitting, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s 90-minute, closed-door luncheon at the Capitol came two days after it was disclosed that the attorney general had fired his staunchly conservative chief spokesman, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON>, allegedly for not defending him aggressively enough. After the meeting, Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, told reporters the subject of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s future had come up `` peripherally.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> added, `` I assume he'll be attorney general for the rest of this year.'' The meeting was `` a good, candid, frank, amicable discussion about the operations of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, press secretary for Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, who also attended the meeting. `` The best thing for all concerned is to wait to see the McKay report,'' added Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>. In related developments: _ Rep <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Mich., has written to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary committees accusing <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s new chief spokesman, of making false statements while he was chief spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today In a letter obtained by the newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said he was stunned when <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Korten </PERSON>, who as <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman `` lost all credibility ... as a result of repeated instances of false and or misleading statements'' to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> committee which <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> chairs. _ <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, chairman of the Citizens for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a 100,000-member lobbying group, urged <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to `` fight it out ... My impression is that the attorney general is anxious to confront his critics and anyone who thinks <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is leaving soon is going to be disappointed.''

<HEAD>Bill To Require Data On Hate Crimes Clears House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A `` hate crimes'' bill requiring the government to keep figures on violence motivated by prejudice is on its way to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> complete with a provision to tabulate crimes against homosexuals. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the Hate Crimes Statistics Act 383-29 on Wednesday after overwhelmingly rejecting an attempt to remove attacks on homosexuals from the hate crimes list. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> <PERSON> Jude </PERSON> <PERSON> Radecic </PERSON>, a lobbyist for the National Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said the action fell short of a step towards gay civil rights but was nevertheless encouraging. `` Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have recognized that anti-gay and anti-lesbian violence is not acceptable in our society,'' she said. `` They are on record as not condoning it.'' The measure passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> requires the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to collect and publish data on the incidence of crimes motivated by prejudice based on race, religion, ethnicity or homosexuality. Homicide, assault, robbery, burglary, theft, arson, vandalism, trespassing and threats would be tabulated. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> publishes an annual Uniform Crime Report on a variety of crime based on information from some 16,000 state and local law enforcement agencies. However, the report does not currently include a national count of hate crimes. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on criminal justice, described a hate crime as `` an act of violence which is accompanied by an additional motive: an attempt to intimidate a larger group or class of people. `` It is important to document that cross burnings are more than ` arson' and that swastikas painted on synagogues are more than ` vandalism','' said Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., sponsor of the bill <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON> and others said comprehensive national figures on crimes motivated by intolerance would enable law enforcement authorities to spot trends in bigotry, develop enforcement and educational strategies, and concentrate manpower in the right places. House debate centered on the inclusion of hate crimes committed against people on grounds of their sexual orientation, a provision that was not in a similar bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the last <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON>, R-Pa., argued that the provision would elevate homosexuals `` to a position higher than other people who are in perhaps worse circumstances. He asked why the bill did not require separate data on crimes against octogenarians, child abuse victims, bus passengers and police officers killed in the line of duty. `` They are not included here and they're all protectable groups of people,'' <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON> said. `` We are not talking about ... crimes committed against passengers on a bus,'' countered Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., one of two acknowledged homosexuals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` There is no centuries-old tradition of hatred against bus passengers, policemen, the handicapped or the young.'' <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> and others said hearings produced substantial evidence that `` gay-bashing'' is frequent and on the rise, and in fact is the most prevalent form of hate crime. They said deleting that category from the bill would imply that violence against gays is acceptable. The Gekas amendment was killed when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 384-30 for a substitute amendment that changed a phrase in the bill but had no substantive effect. The successful measure, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, R-Wash., replaced the phrase sexual orientation with a more specific reference to homosexuality Supporters of the bill include the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, several religious groups and organizations representing police officers, psychologists, homosexuals and women. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes the measure, contending its data-collection requirements will be difficult and expensive to meet, and be burdensome to law enforcement authorities.

<TEXT>
 A petition organized by a Christian human rights group asks a Shiite Moslem religious leader in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to intercede on behalf of Westerners being held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a former captive said Wednesday. The prayerful plea, with 40,000 signatures, was carried out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week and is expected to be delivered this weekend to <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, who spent 17 months in captivity. The wording of the petition was carefully worked out in consultation with <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> religious leaders, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said in a telephone interview at his home in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, 32 miles south of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Reading from a copy of the petition, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said it reads: `` In the name of one merciful God, we the undersigned wish to express to you our concern and prayers for the hostages held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We also pray for the countless Lebanese held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` As believers in almighty God we have faith that prayer is more powerful than armies or contingents of diplomats. Because of this we respectfully ask you to pray with us and to do whatever you can to intercede on behalf of all these hostages and captives.''' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> is a Shiite Moslem religious leader associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or the Party of God, The Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is the group believed responsible for the kidnapping of Americans, British and other Westerners in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` What makes this so very important is that a story came out Tuesday in which <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said the only way the hostages can be released is through direct talks with the abductors,'' <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. It is hoped that <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> can facilitate those talks, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. A total of 18 Westerners are being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, has been held captive longest. He was kidnapped on March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, 57, was released by his captors in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Nov. 2, 1986, after being held for 17 months. He was working as the hospital administrator at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> when he was seized on May 28, 1985. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said the petition specifically asks <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> to `` join us in prayer'' for the safe return home of Anglican church envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, who was taken hostage last year while trying to negotiate the release of other Western captives. The petition concludes, `` We share with you the desire to see all people safe and at peace, and we agree with your statement, ` Neither Islam nor Christianity justify kidnapping.''' The petition was organized by Friends in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, a small <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> group based in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, that has worked quietly, but tirelessly for the release of the hostages since 1986, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> asked that the leader of Friends in the West not be named, saying it may endanger his life, or his freedom, in further efforts to free the hostages.

<HEAD>Congress Agreeable to Bipartisan Drug Panel, but Suspicion Remains</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say they'll accept President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s call for a bipartisan anti-drug task force, but some question his election-year timing and wonder why he did n't act sooner. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called Wednesday for the task force to find a consensus within 45 days on all aspects of the anti-narcotics campaign, and said the battle against illegal drugs is in danger of being `` tripped up'' by political debate. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal comes as his administration faces mounting criticism on the drug issue, most notably for its willingness to consider dropping drug charges against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. And with elections approaching, the nation's politicians are trying to outdo each other as foes of drug abuse. Presidential candidates speak of the issue, lawmakers are demanding that the military be more involved, and congressional task forces in both houses are studying new, comprehensive legislation to supplement a major 1986 drug bill. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> select committee on narcotics, said of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: `` In this political year, he thought there was still something more that had to be done and I could not agree with him more.'' But <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> noted that the task force proposed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would report `` on the eve of the Democratic convention this July and the August Republican convention.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday, `` We welcome the president's belated We are ready to cooperate with him. `` We have already begun to work,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` The administration has been lax in the treatment of this subject. The president has suddenly decided he will cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> appointed a `` Working Group on Substance Abuse'' as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. The group, to report by June 29, will work to `` expedite the consideration of legislation to strengthen existing drug laws and to provide additional resources for the drug abuse crisis.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made his comments in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, in a commencement address at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we can not remove the politics from drugs, how can we hope to remove the drugs from our communities, workplaces and schools?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked his audience of 159 white-uniformed, graduating cadets and their relatives. `` Illegal drug use is the foremost concern in our country. And, frankly, as I finish my final year in office and look ahead, I worry that excessive drug politics might undermine effective drug policy,'' he said. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said he `` welcomes the administration's interest in the drug issue'' and pointed out that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> established its own bipartisan task force on May 9 to produce a new drug bill. Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> narcotics committee, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was `` plowing old ground We already had task forces and already had bills with bipartisan support. This is a feeble attempt to justify what has been a failed policy.'' But a Republican member of the panel, Rep. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, R-Calif., said the administration alone can not be blamed for problems in the war on drugs He said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership tried to block his amendment to the defense bill that would require the military to seal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders against drug smugglers within 45 days after enactment. The amendment passed 385-23 and its fate will be decided in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, by 83-6, passed a less sweeping amendment to get the military involved. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., said he was `` delighted to hear President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> once again declare illegal drugs ` public enemy No 1.''' The senator said he and Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> have spent nine months drafting a comprehensive drug bill, and suggested it be used as a blueprint for the president's task force. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> was critical of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday. `` If we took action, there would n't be any necessity for rhetoric,'' he said. Speaking of the bipartisan commission, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said, `` It is unfortunate that it took the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to drag the administration, kicking and screaming, to the altar on doing something about drugs.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his task force should produce a report on issues such as how the military should be involved in the campaign and whether the death penalty should be imposed when a police officer or other people are killed as a result of drug trafficking. `` Our task force should agree on solutions for every area of the drug problem, from blocking supplies to curtailing demand, from treatment to education to prosecution, from interdiction and confiscation to eradication _ nothing should be overlooked or ruled out,'' the president said.

<HEAD>NBC Hoping to Keep Cosby After Next Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is hoping that <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> will still be having such fun in his fifth year of `` The Cosby Show'' that the network can persuade its No. 1 star to stay on past next season. <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> had said he would only do five years of `` The Cosby Show,'' which quickly became the top-rated network show four seasons ago and is credited with putting <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> into first place. `` This is our fifth season, and it's supposed to be our last, so I'm going to have my fun this year _ not in messing up, but in doing things even better,'' <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> told advertisers here Wednesday to get a peek at the network's fall lineup. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> are also scheduled to announce their fall schedules this month. At a news conference, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said the network hoped to persuade Cosby to stay after next season. `` If he's having fun, and he's got stories to tell, we might convince him to come back,'' said <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, though he added that there had been no formal talks with <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>. At Wednesday's presentation, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> unveiled some of its new series. <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> insisted the network is not playing it safe with the fall schedule, having canceled some successful but aging series and adding stylish, new shows. Advertisers were shown clips from some of them. `` Midnight Caller'' stars <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> -LRB- `` Fatal Vision'' -RRB- as a mouthy, troubled ex-cop who is persuaded by a radio station owner to take on a late-night radio call-in show and becomes a cult hero. The show is set in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The clips from the pilot looked a little derivative _ it was directed by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, the talented director of the `` Miami Vice'' pilot _ but <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> is a charismatic actor, and the series shows promise. `` Baby Boom,'' based on and produced by the same people who did the movie of the same name, stars <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> role as a high-powered career woman suddenly saddled with an infant she inherits from a distant relative. The clips got laughs from advertisers, and the show looks to be a sophisticated winner. Another tantalizing, sophisticated hour-long series, `` Tattinger's,'' comes from the producers of `` St. Elsewhere'' and shows the same smart dramatic and comic twists. It stars <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, sure to be a new TV heartthrob, as a flamboyant, recently divorced restaurauteur who battles rude cabbies, drug dealers and mobsters while courting his long-suffering ex-wife -LRB- <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> <PERSON> Danner </PERSON> -RRB-. Another virtually certain hit is `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' starring fine comic actor <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> -LRB- `` Taxi'' -RRB- as a newly divorced middle-aged man. It is based on a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> series of the same name and will go into <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Thursday lineup of hit comedies. Likewise `` Empty Nest,'' from the makers of `` Golden Girls,'' starring <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> as a recently widowed pediatrician contending with life and kids. The show will follow `` Golden Girls'' on Saturday night, and there will be some crossover of characters between the two series. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> canceled `` The Facts of Life,'' `` Crime Story,'' `` A Year in the Life,'' `` Our <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Buntz </LOCATION>,'' `` The Bronx Zoo'' and `` Aaron's Way.'' `` The Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'' is getting a summer run on Wednesday nights, and <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said if the show does phenomenally well, which he did n't really seem to expect, it could come back. `` Day by Day'' and `` In the Heat of the Night,'' which were spring replacement series, made the fall schedule. <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said it was a toss-up between `` Day by Day'' and `` My Two Dads,'' but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is gambling on the appeal of teen star, C.B. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, of `` Day by Day.'' Another star <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is pinning hopes on is <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON> of `` <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoon </PERSON>,'' an offbeat detective series that was also a replacement series. <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said he regretted bidding farewell to `` Crime Story,'' but the hardest decision was canceling `` A Year in the Life.'' `` There were some darlings of mine that in this game of musical chairs, I could not get everybody to sit down,'' he said.

 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> of not doing enough to prevent guerrilla raids into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from their territory. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> made the comment Wednesday, a day after one Palestinian guerrilla crossed the border fence between <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and was wounded and captured by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. Two other guerrillas escaped back to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` There is no doubt in my mind that the authorities in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> are doing sometimes not everything that can be done to prevent the -LRB- infiltrations -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Tuesday night's infiltration was the second from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the 13th attempt since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Since Dec. 1, guerrillas have twice tried to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> linked the increase in infiltration attempts to the `` intefadah,'' Arabic for uprising. He charged the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> with inciting terror attacks from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> as well as inside the occupied lands to breathe life into the rebellion. But <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said that thanks to the army's tough response, the uprising was dying out. `` We have seen a gradual reduction of civilian violent activities as a result of ... measures we have taken such as arrests, administrative detentions, deportations,'' he said on a tour of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> denied that the latest raid into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was launched from its territory, saying it `` would never allow infiltrators to cross from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> into occupied Arab territories.'' In another development, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops backed by helicopters and bulldozers on Wednesday carried out a pre-dawn raid on two Arab mountain villages and were surrounded by hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians. Hospital officials said one Arab villager was killed and 10 were wounded. Troops also shot and wounded four Arabs during a confrontation in the marketplace of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the largest <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city, the army said. The fatality Wednesday brought the Arab death toll in the uprising to 191, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. Two Israelis also have died. Arab doctors said at least 20 Palestinians were injured by beatings and rubber bullets during the clashes in <LOCATION> Abwein </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION>, neighboring villages north of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. Witnesses said hundreds were arrested. An army spokesman confirmed one <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was killed and nine wounded. But he refused comment on the arrests or the reason for the sweeps on the final day of Id el Fitr, the three-day Moslem holiday marking the end of the holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. In both villages fighting lasted through Wednesday morning, with helicopters dropping tear gas, before soldiers gained control and moved from house to house in search of suspects, witnesses said. In <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION>, troops rounded up about 300 teen-agers and young men in a schoolyard, a 19-year-old Palestinian said from his hospital bed in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Abwein </LOCATION>, soldiers made no arrests, apparently because most youths fled into the surrounding hills, said a merchant who would only give his first name, <PERSON> Saam </PERSON>. But he said troops beat several women and in some cases smashed furniture with clubs. Army bulldozers pushed aside roadblocks that had been set up by villagers and forced residents to remove outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags from a mosque tower and utility poles, witnesses said. A black flag of mourning fluttered from the home of <PERSON> Majdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilal </PERSON>, a 16-year-old boy who was fatally shot in the chest during the clashes. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, troops were attacked by youths throwing stones as they patrolled the city's market, an army spokesman said. `` The troops fired at the Arabs when they were in danger,'' wounding four Palestinians, the spokesman said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday ordered that teen-agers in the Gadna paramilitary youth corps not be allowed to serve in areas where Arab prisoners were held, the army said. A army spokesman said the order was in response to an incident in which a teen-ager in the corps beat an Arab prisoner during a visit to a detention center after being encouraged to do so by an army sergeant.

 An aide to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> has moved into the top staff job at the Democratic Platform Committee. Democratic officials revealed Wednesday the personnel shuffle took place at the end of last week, a few days after the Democrats held their first hearing on the 1988 platform. <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, deputy director of the state of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, is now acting executive director of the platform committee in addition to her duties as its press secretary <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, who quit her post as general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to head the platform committee staff March 1, has been reassigned as a special assistant to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said the personnel shuffle was done to make `` better use of people and abilities'' and to `` maximize our strengths. <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said, `` It's really just a question of using resources best, especially when you're trying to do something long-distance.'' She said in an interview that she has been helping the party reach out to its constituent groups, especially women's and civil rights groups, and will continue that work for <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> `` for the remaining 56 days until the convention.'' The committee heard from several dozen witnesses, primarily from stalwart liberal groups, at its first hearing May 10, and is holding several more forums around the country over the next few weeks. `` Having gotten that started, we're going to let Gov. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s people, some very talented people from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> take over and do the rest of the events, and the drafting,'' <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> put me in the job with <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s OK.'' Her removal was `` a mutual decision by everybody _ <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> and myself. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> has instructed <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s committee to keep the platform short and styled as `` an open letter'' to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, not weighted down with a myriad of special interest groups' pet positions. A platform committee hearing on defense issues that was postponed last Friday in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, will be held this Friday in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> and the rest of a 15-member drafting committee will huddle on <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, June 9-13 to draft the platform The full 163-member committee will take it up in late June. The platform is on the agenda July 19, the second night of the party convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Baker Won't Write Book, but Others Have</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says top <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides have `` at least an implied commitment'' not to write about their intimacy with power. If so, its a commitment as often honored in the breach as in the observance. A quick survey shows that half a dozen people who have held <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s post of White House chief of staff, or its equivalent, have written books about their experience. About the same number have passed up the temptation. At least three of the chiefs of staff who have written books have described tempestuous circumstances surrounding their departures from the White House. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, however, was apparently the first to rush into print while the president he had served was still in office, which partly accounts for the unprecedented furor his book has aroused. `` I do n't think you ought to write those books,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday. `` I think when you take a job like this that there's at least an implied commitment that you're not going to write books like that. If you're in daily, intimate contact with the president in a decision-making process, I think there's an obligation to treat that discreetly and confidentially. `` I do not intend to write a book,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` I think the bloom is off the rose now with the kiss-and-tell books and I very much hope that that's a phenomemon that's going to subside and go away.'' Maybe so, but it's been around for a while. The very first person to hold the title of White House chief of staff, <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, brought out a book about his experiences in 1961, one year after the president he served, <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, left office. Like more recent ones, the book contained direct quotations from the president's conversations, such as one in which <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> told <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> that the maneuverings of one <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> party leader `` looked like pretty slippery business'' to him. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> did not identify the party leader. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> also sprinkled his book with what appear to be direct quotes from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, although he omitted the quotation marks `` out of deference to the office and the man'' except when he was quoting what had appeared elsewhere. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' book, `` Firsthand Report,'' contrasts sharply with <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s in one respect. In the index, it has nine entries for first lady <PERSON> Mamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. The index to <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s `` For the Record'' has half a column of entries for <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and nine separate headings covering his controversial disclosures of her interest in astrology. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> is one of the two previous chiefs of staff who, like <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, left office under fire _ <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> over his handling of the Iran-Contra affair and <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> over his acceptance of gifts from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldfine </PERSON>. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, describing his abrupt replacement by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, recounts an angry telephone conversation in which he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> he had `` deserved better treatment'' and the president replied only that he was sorry. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who had a reputation for reticence, wrote that when he handed the president his proposed statement of resignation, <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> `` said that he wanted nobody but me to make this decision and that under the circumstances he thought I had acted wisely.'' In contrast to this low-key account, H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> wrote a dramatic recital of his dismissal by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> at Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> telling him that the night before he had `` prayed that I would n't wake up in the morning.'' <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> said he was touched by the president's words, but was hurt to discover after a <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> television interview in 1977 that the president had spoken the same words to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON> in firing him the same day. In fact, he said it was this interview that prompted him, almost four years after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, to write his book, `` The Ends of Power.'' He said the effect of the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> interview was to `` distort and confuse'' Watergate issues. The most recent chief of staff to break into print was <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, whose 1982 book, `` Crisis,'' dealt with the last year of the Carter presidency. Other books by top <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides include `` A Political Education,'' published in 1972, by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, who was special counsel to President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, and two books about the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> administration by <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodpaster </PERSON>, who took over many of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' duties, and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON>, have written books but they did not deal with their White House days.

 <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was recovering well following successful surgery to remove a malignant tumor from inside his skull, a hospital spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> underwent the operation Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Barrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelbart </PERSON> said Wednesday. The 61-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> man was recovering well and without complications, but no further information was being released at the request of his family, Ms. <PERSON> Gelbart </PERSON> said. She said that decisions on further treatment would be delayed until next week, `` pending review of all post-operative studies.'' An <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> newspaper reported that <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was diagnosed as having brain cancer two weeks ago. He was transferred from the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Barrows </LOCATION> on May 11. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, who has been the president of the nation's largest union since 1983, relinquished his duties for four months effective May 4 because of health problems.

 Recipe for a potentially record-winning burrito: mix 70 pounds of beans with 70 pounds of meat, spread it in 750 tortilla shells and sprinkle with 15 pounds of cheese. And hope the locals like Mexican food. The 444-foot-long burrito, constructed Wednesday by students at <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was divided into 600 six-inch pieces that went for $ 1 each. But the sponsor's goal was bigger than the public's appetite: about half the big burrito was left over and had to be thrown away. Still, the project raised $ 300 for the <ORGANIZATION> Cookeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> for the homeless, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagemann </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>. The goal was to build a 500-foot burrito, but the weather interfered as workers tried to cover 65 tables with the flour tortilla shells in preparation for stuffing. `` It was too windy a day. All of our burrito flours -LRB- tortilla shells -RRB- were flying away,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Dishman </PERSON>, shift manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Cookeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, which helped build the burrito. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> burrito builders hold the Guinness Book of World Records award for the largest burrito _ a 400-footer _ said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Null </PERSON>, assistant manager of <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>. Guinness officials were invited Wednesday, but none showed up, <PERSON> Dishman </PERSON> said. But he said the organizers plan to send <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> some photos of the burrito and a sworn statement from the <LOCATION> Cookville </LOCATION> mayor in the hope they will be declared the new champion.

<TEXT>
 The late head of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Jewish community may not have acted alone in the apparent embezzlement of millions of dollars of government funds earmarked for Holocaust survivors, prosecutors say The family attorney for <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON>, who died in January, said on Wednesday that he had been unable to determine where the missing money had gone and that <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> may have squandered much of it. The family has filed for bankruptcy in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> lived and ran a wholesale textile business. <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for 23 years until his death from a heart attack at age 62, may have had accomplices in the scheme, said <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Roething </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Karlsruhe </ORGANIZATION> prosecutor's office. He said investigators would seek to determine `` whether other parties may be liable for prosecution as accessories.'' Government officials have vowed to bring the truth to light. A top aide to Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is to meet Friday with <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> as council president. Jewish leaders have expressed shock and outrage. They say they believe <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> had for years embezzled money earmarked for Holocaust survivors around the world, which he was in charge of disbursing. <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> appears to have stolen more than $ 6 million. But <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Paepcke </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> family attorney, said he believes the late Jewish leader may have embezzled up to $ 15 million and used some of it to bolster his failing business. <PERSON> Paepcke </PERSON>, who said he had worked for <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> for a decade, indicated he believed <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> had squandered some of the money. He said he filed for bankruptcy March 30 for <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON>'s heirs and the Karlsruhe-based company. `` I do not understand this yet,'' he told West German television. `` The sums of money that were apparently taken should have been more than enough to cover -LRB- the Nachmann business' -RRB- debts.'' `` I can only conclude that perhaps the money also went elsewhere,'' he added without elaboration. <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON>, a court-appointed investigator who has been examining <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON>'s financial records, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he found unexplained income of $ 13 million in <ORGANIZATION> Nachmann </ORGANIZATION>'s company records. Jewish leaders vowed to launch their own investigations to help clear up the case. `` We will use all legal means at our disposal to take action against everyone who took part in this,'' <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> Jewish leader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON>, who became Jewish Council president in 1965, was in charge of disbursing about $ 236 million that had been allocated by the government in 1980 for Holocaust survivors who had not previously made reparations claims. Those funds were in addition to the $ 47 billion already paid by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to Holocaust victims or their families. <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> is suspected of having taken interest that accumulated from the funds appropriated in 1980 and transferring it to other accounts, including his private business, according to newspaper and other media reports. <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON>'s family fled <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1938. He returned to <ORGANIZATION> Karlsruhe </ORGANIZATION> in 1945 and began working toward re-establishing Jewish communities in the country.

<HEAD>Administration Says Minimum Wage Increase Could Cost 850,000 Jobs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House has entered the congressional fray over a proposed increase in the minimum wage, arguing that it could cost 850,000 jobs while adding to the budget deficit. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, chairman of the President's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisors </ORGANIZATION>, says even the smallest increase under consideration, raising the minimum wage from $ 3.35 to $ 4.65 per hour by 1992, would cost 600,000 jobs. Those losses `` would be concentrated among younger, less skilled and minority workers,'' he said. A chart supplied by <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> indicates an increase in the minimum wage to $ 5.05 an hour over four years would eliminate 850,000 jobs by 1992. Legislation to raise the minimum wage $ 4.65 by 1991 was introduced last year, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> raised the figure to $ 5.05 per hour over four years. The original bill proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> chairs `` Increasing the minimum wage would have adverse effects on employment, unemployment, economic output and on the budget deficit,'' <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said in a letter to Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petri </PERSON>, R-Wisc., a committee member `` Increasing the federal minimum wage would do little to help the working poor; under 20 percent of minimum wage workers are poor and many would lose employment,'' <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> wrote in the letter, released Wednesday. `` The direct impact on the budget deficit would be about $ 2 billion, due to both increased budget outlays and reduced revenues.'' He also said consumers would have to absorb roughly $ 13 billion more in higher costs for the products that minimum-wage workers help to produce. Democrats have argued that a minimum wage would have a minimal effect on unemployment and the economy, and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>'s findings in a statement released Wednesday night. `` That's preposterous,'' he said. `` The president could have obtained a more reliable estimate of the job effect from <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>,'' the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> astrologer contacted by <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for advice.. <PERSON> Petri </PERSON> sought <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>'s assessment of the minimum wage legislation after charging that the Democratic leadership had attempted to suppress a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report that said an increase to $ 5.05 an hour will cost up to 500,000 jobs The draft study was sent to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> labor Chairman <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., who returned it to the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION>, asking only the costs of the bill and not its economic impact House Republicans charged that the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> `` deliberately censored information pertinent to consideration of the bill or was specifically instructed to do so and followed that instruction,'' according to a letter from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said an earned income tax credit -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> EITC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, an alternative proposed by <PERSON> Petri </PERSON> but rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, would target assistance to families of the working poor more directly than an increase in the minimum wage <PERSON> Petri </PERSON> plans to place his proposal for a wage supplement which would base the credit on family size before the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> when the legislation reaches the floor. `` Without the same adverse effects on the economy, and with comparable or even smaller budgetary cost than the proposed increased in the minimum wage, an expanded <ORGANIZATION> EITC </ORGANIZATION> would target increased income to working heads of larger families below or close to poverty level,'' said <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>.

 Sex therapists <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> say they published their controversial book on AIDS because too little attention was being paid to the potential spread of the disease among heterosexuals. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> AIDS commission on Wednesday that the authors did not mean to create `` panic in the streets,'' but wanted to `` counteract an earlier absence of openness, of honesty in collaboration'' on the part of government officials. Federal health officials have criticized the book for suggesting AIDS is spreading more rapidly among sexually active heterosexuals than projected by official government estimates. Another criticism is that the Masters-Johnson findings did not go through the `` peer review'' process required for publication in a major medical journal. `` There would have been no way to publish in journals,'' said Masters, citing both the length of the material and what he said is traditional difficulty in getting sex research accepted in such forums. `` Books are the characteristic mode of publishing in the field of sex research, which is our field,'' added Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolodny </PERSON>, a long-term associate of the Masters-Johnson team and a co-author of the book `` Crisis: Heterosexual Behavior in the Age of AIDS.'' To commission chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' admonition that there should be `` an element of solidarity, you might say, among the scientific and medical community'' on AIDS, <PERSON> Kolodny </PERSON> replied: `` With all due respect ... the process of science is not and has never been served by looking for unanimity of opinion. The process of science has always been served by allowing people to speak on varying interpretations.'' <PERSON> Kolodny </PERSON> acknowledged the book's estimate that as many as 3 million Americans may have the virus without knowing it is about twice as high as the official government estimate. But he emphasized that the difference stems from different interpretations of the same raw data available to both government and private analysts. As to controversy over what is often called casual spread of the disease, <PERSON> Kolodny </PERSON> said the book carefully distinguishes between theory and saying `` as a practical matter, this is not something you ought to worry about.'' For example, on the question of risk of catching the virus in a restaurant where a waiter or chief has AIDS `` we said in our book, specifically, not unless you have sex or share needles with that person.'' On catching it from a toilet seat? `` We traveled here by public transportation and we all used the toilets in those areas and that should address the practical aspects of the risk,'' said <PERSON> Kolodny </PERSON>. `` We do not suggest for a minute that people not use public rest rooms, but we do suggest that if the public place looks to be contaminated with suspicious substances, blood or other materials, we would n't have used that 15 years ago in the time before AIDS and we do n't suspect that anyone would really use that now. `` This is common sense. No one is claiming that the virus jumps off a surface and bites you,'' <PERSON> Kolodny </PERSON> said.

He said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> did not want to keep what could be an embarrassing tally of the calls. `` The White House is now acting very bizarrely,'' he said. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> `` thinks they're getting jerked around because the president's giving a big drug speech and they do n't want to have anything critical like this.''

White House spokesman <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON> refused a reporter's request to find out whether operators were refusing to transfer the calls. `` I do n't know anything about the operators,'' he said. `` I'm not going to track that down, I'm sorry. He also declined to explain how the inquiries office functioned, and refused a request to determine how the office decides when to begin keeping a tally of calls on an issue. <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON> said that office had received calls Wednesday about the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but `` They did n't have a count of them and no characterization of the answers.''

<HEAD>Dukakis' Minority Supporters Beginning To Aggressively Court Black
Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Black backers of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who have seen <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reap almost unanimous black support in the primary races to date, are now moving aggressively to court the black vote for the November election. A group of 80 minority members who advise <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has decided, with his approval, to expand efforts to meet and talk with members of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign and to lobby black leaders before the Democratic National Convention in July. The group will be working to identify possible party platform differences _ before the convention can put them in the spotlight. Also, there is to be a meeting later this month between the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and about 100 black leaders from across the country. And there will be appearances by black <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters throughout the South in the next eight weeks. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> group's leader, long-time adviser <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, says he and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> go way back together. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a college classmate of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said in an interview this week, `` We went to civil rights fights together, to jail together.'' `` We see our role as getting out there now as advance folks, getting out and letting our people know who this man is, much more aggressively than we have in the past,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. `` We feel that the people who are supporting <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ought to know who <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is,'' he said. `` That investment at this time is very important.'' Besides <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> himself, the group of minority <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters includes many black leaders with ties to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters have threatened to fight delegate-selection and other rules at the convention. But <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said he hoped increased communication between the campaigns would allow <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to settle other differences and avoid public feuding that could alienate black <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters. `` We're going to talk unity,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. `` But there are only two guys who can make the final deal _ <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s presidential campaign manager who handled negotiations with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in 1984, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who speaks with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at least weekly, appears to have a better relationship with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> than <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> did. `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> believes that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> respects him and that goes a long way with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> said. `` It's not a question of getting something resolved now but to begin talking about how you're going to do it.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> declined comment when asked if the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign would cooperate with <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> and other black <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters. He said recently that he was speaking frequently with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> but that those talks have not involved issues likely to arise at or just before the convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has insisted the choice of picking a running mate is his alone to make, and he is not expected to offer <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket. As his delegate lead has widened, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in recent weeks has been more forceful in asserting differences with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> but still has avoided direct criticism of the civil rights leader. Aides say <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is banking on winning the final primaries in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and delegate-rich <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on June 7 to lessen <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s bargaining position heading into the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention. Some <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides say privately that they fear a falling-out with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would cost the Democratic ticket black support it needs to carry several states in the South. Publicly, however, the aides profess only optimism. `` We feel strongly that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> will come out with us,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. `` We are looking forward to a fight with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and we are looking forward to locking arms with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edley </PERSON>, issues director for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign and a White House aide during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, refused to say whether he personally has had recent talks with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides. <PERSON> Edley </PERSON>, who is black, did say, `` I share my candidate's optimism that we will be able to bring the party together without serious acrimony on any front.'' The meeting between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the black leaders, most of them already <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters, is planned for Memorial Day in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Members of <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>'s group and other black <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters then will fan out across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and to Northern cities with large black populations, holding rallies and meeting with black media organizations to discuss <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. `` We want to get there early, not wait until after June 7 or after the convention to sell the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> message and the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> record,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. An information package his group has put together says that while minorities make up 6.7 percent of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' population, 12 percent of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' judicial appointments have been minorities and 13 percent of state workers are minorities. `` This is n't some Johnny-come-lately that we're all sitting here window dressing because the national press is asking ` Where is the black presence around <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.' It's always been there,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Langhart </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> television personality serving as a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> media adviser.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet diplomats met to talk about efforts to end <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s 13-year civil war and lead <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to independence. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, met on Wednesday with <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON>, deputy foreign minister, at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. U.S.-sponsored mediation seeking peace in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, was stalled for years over demands by each side that the other withdraw its forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> first. However, talks progressed in recent weeks after a joint Angolan-Cuban proposal in March for phased withdrawal of Cuban troops. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and its Cuban supporters are fighting rebels for control of the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony. The rebels are backed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> rules <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in defiance of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution.

 When <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> got word that her South Bend, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, elementary school had been chosen as one of the nation's best, she made good on a promise to her pupils and kissed the concrete steps to the building. `` I told you if we won this, I'd kiss the steps you walk on,'' said the overjoyed principal of <ORGANIZATION> Muessel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> as students watched her fulfill the pledge. Her jubilation was shared by the principals, pupils, teachers and parents at 286 other schools across the country Wednesday, from a posh private academy in <ORGANIZATION> Grosse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pointe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, to a largely Hispanic public school in <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, to a <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, school for the learning disabled. All made the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>'s list of exemplary elementary schools. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> DuPont </PERSON>, headmaster ofGrosse <ORGANIZATION> Pointe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, said, `` As an independent school in a pretty sharp place, I'm not really too surprised we got it.'' `` The real question remains, how close are we to No. 1?'' added <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>, whose school charges up to $ 5,700 tuition and whose parents raised more than $ 500,000 at the school's spring auction last weekend. At <ORGANIZATION> Frye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, one of 230 public schools in the winners' circle, more than half the children are Hispanic and nearly two-thirds qualify for free or reduced-price meals because of their families' low incomes. But 75 percent read at or above grade level, and their math scores are even higher. The award shows `` that a school does n't have to have a demographic breakdown that is mostly high socioeconomic to be considered an excellent school,'' said <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> principal <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Polvani </PERSON>. `` Too often in this country, a school is evaluated by the color of the kids and their ethnicity or the socioeconomics. ... It should n't be that way.'' A power-sharing arrangement with <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>'s teachers has helped the school rack up achievement gains, said <PERSON> Polvani </PERSON>, as has a `` very, very effective'' bilingual education program. At the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> in Silver Spring, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, Rabbi <PERSON> Pinchos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> said the award `` means a lot. I can tell you until tomorrow that we really do a good job. But when somebody from the outside says it, it feels good.'' The selections were made by 100 people from outside government _ only a third of them educators _ who reviewed more than 600 schools nominated by state school superintendents and the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Every state except <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> produced at least one winner. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> did not nominate any school; one <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> school failed to make the final cut. Principals and other school representatives will be invited to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the fall to receive `` flags of excellence.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has hosted the ceremony in past years at the White House. The schools were judged by their stated philosophy and goals, organization, leadership, curriculum, instruction, climate, character development and community relations. The program also gave extra attention this year to schools with special math and science programs. The department honors exemplary elementary schools one year and secondary schools the next. Junior highs usually compete among the secondary schools.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, riding an impressive string of primary victories, is taking aim at the blocs of delegates he needs to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination. Still several hundred delegates shy of a convention majority, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The states are the two big prizes on June 7, the day that closes out the Democratic primary season. There are 314 Democratic delegates at stake in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary and 109 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The other two June 7 states are <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with 24 delegates and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> with 19. At a news conference on Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> brushed aside <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s complaint that he was not getting his fair share of support from the party and elected officials designated `` super delegates'' to the nominating convention. `` I think <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> has a perfect right to voice criticism of whatever he chooses to criticize,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think we are going to have a fight with Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' After he arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> complaint, `` We all knew what the rules were going in.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> continued to insist that he wo n't start the process of choosing a running mate until after he has clinched the nomination. Asked about reports he has designated his close friend and law school classmate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> to head the search for a vice presidential candidate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` Nobody is heading my search for a running mate. The search for a running mate will not begin until the eighth of June.'' But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said he hoped to have chosen a running mate before the Democratic convention convenes in July. `` I would hope that decision would be made before the convention,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been getting plenty of advice about where to turn for the second spot on the Democratic ticket, most of it centering on members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Among the names mentioned most often were Sens. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Asked about the home-state favorite when he arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, `` I like him.''

 Iranian speedboats attacked a Norwegian tanker twice in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> on Thursday, shipping executives said. It was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s second foray against neutral vessels in two days in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The executives identified the tanker as the 55,173-ton <ORGANIZATION> Berge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strand </ORGANIZATION>, an empty liquefied petroleum gas carrier. Its destination in the gulf was not immediately determined. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they did not know what weapons were used against the vessel in the first attack, at 6:30 a.m. -LRB- 10:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday -RRB-. The Berge Strand began sailing to the southern gulf port of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> for repairs on minor damage. There were no injuries reported. An hour later the speedboats returned and fired four rockets at the ship, injuring one person, the sources said. They said that the Berge Strand developed engine problems after the second raid, but had no further details. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacked the Japanese-owned chemical tanker Ace <PERSON> Chemi </PERSON> on Wednesday. A fire started on the 6,730-ton Ace <PERSON> Chemi </PERSON> that forced its Japanese captain and 16 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> crewmen to abandon ship in <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the gulf's only outlet. All were rescued by salvage tugs, said shipping executives who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the ground war, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian forces killed or wounded 2,000 Iraqi troops and captured more than 10 square miles of northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in an operation that began Tuesday night. It said many Iraqi troops were taken prisoner. There was no comment from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s 32nd convoy of the year was sailing south through the gulf. It included one U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker, the 46,723-ton Gas Prince, escorted by the missile frigate <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>. The Ace <PERSON> Chemi </PERSON> attack was the first by Iranian gunboats on a neutral vessel since April 24. It came one month after a major clash with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval forces in which six Iranian craft were sunk or disabled. It also was the first since the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration began a new policy May 3 that permits <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships to intervene in attacks on commercial vessels on request regardless of what flag they are flying. Iranian officials recently declared their policy of blow-for-blow retaliatory attacks on neutral shipping would continue. The Ace <PERSON> Chemi </PERSON> raid happened 11 miles south of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> island oil terminal as the Panamanian-flagged ship was heading into the gulf, bound for the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> oil port of <LOCATION> Jubail </LOCATION> for a cargo of petrochemicals, the sources said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships were on patrol as usual in the area at the time of the 8 a.m. attack and monitored the tanker's distress call on radio. But the nearest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessel was 60 miles away, a two-hour sail at top speed, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has claimed a dozen raids, six of them independently verified, on Iranian tankers and terminals since April 29. The raids seek to strangle oil exports that support <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the 7 -LCB- - year-old gulf war

<HEAD>Carlucci OKs Development of Missile Rail System; Contracts Let</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has awarded two contracts totaling almost $ 329 million to develop a rail-car launching system for the MX nuclear missile, the Pentagon says. The contracts were let after <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> authorized full-scale development of such a ` rail garrison' system. `` As currently configured, the ` rail garrison' system will consist of 50 missiles, based aboard 25 trains with each carrying two missiles,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The MX, a 10-warhead, 195,000-pound missile, is now entering the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s inventory as a silo-based weapon. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to allow deployment of 100 of the missiles, but so far only 50 have been authorized. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a bid to obtain approval for the second 50, proposed in December 1986 that a rail version of the missile be produced to improve its survivability in the event of a Soviet attack. His proposal is known as rail garrison because it envisions placing MX missiles on rail cars that would remain inside military bases, or garrisons, until there was a threat of attack. Only then would they scatter across the country on the commercial rail network. Unlike the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> currently does not have any mobile intercontinental missiles. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contracts are for the construction and testing of the missile-carrying, launch control and security rail cars that will be needed to make the 71-foot missile mobile. A $ 167 million contract was awarded to <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Marine Division in <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to design, develop and test the missile launch car. The second contract, worth $ 161.7 million, was awarded to <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Autonetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> Division in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for the design, development and testing of the launch control system, launch control car and security car. Both contractors will be expected to complete their work by July 1992, the Pentagon said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has said it expects each train to include two locomotives and six cars _ two missile launch cars with missiles inside; one launch control car; two security cars, and one maintenance car. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has generally endorsed the idea of developing a mobile missile, but is now locked in a debate over whether to produce a rail version of the MX or a much smaller, single-warhead missile known as the Midgetman that could be fired from a truck launcher.

 Thousands of people rallied in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to tell authorities the sentencing of an Azerbaijani man does not address their demands that a neighboring region be annexed, a dissident source said. `` They think the problem goes deeper than sentencing guilty people,'' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryabokon </PERSON>, an editor of the dissident journal Express-Khronika, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Ryabokon </PERSON> said about 15,000 Armenians rallied in the streets of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, on Tuesday, a day after <PERSON> Talekh </PERSON> <PERSON> Salekh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogli </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON> was found guilty of premeditated murder and given the maximum sentence of 15 years.

Their campaign apparently led to the riots. Thirty-two people _ 26 ethnic Armenians and six ethnic Azerbaijanis _ were killed in the rioting. The Soviet government has refused to permit the annexation.

 The chief chef at a popular seafood restaurant chain returned to the hospital where he had been a patient recently to perform some corrective surgery of his own. In the kitchen. As the specialist he is, <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Paimblanc </PERSON> supervised a well-scrubbed staff of more than 100 at <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. A few watched as he made an incision into a cooked fish. `` Perfect,'' said <PERSON> Paimblanc </PERSON>, of Legal Sea Food's restaurants. `` It should taste moist, but not too soft. This is good.'' For Wednesday's lunch and dinner, Paimblanc and two Legal Sea Food employees oversaw preparation of 1,400 meals for patients and staff at the 460-bed hospital. `` It just takes a little attention to make good, fresh meals,'' said <PERSON> Paimblanc </PERSON>. `` Hospitals serve fish sticks when they could get in fresh fish. They serve frozen vegetables when they could buy presliced fresh vegetables. It does n't take much to make a much better meal.'' The items on the menu were identical to those served at <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION>'s six <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> restaurants, including the fish chowder included at President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s inaugural dinner in January 1981. <PERSON> Paimblanc </PERSON> added a newly created low-calorie clam chowder with clams and vegetables. `` With all the studies talking about the benefits of fish and fish oils on health, it seems like hospitals should be talking a closer look at their meals,'' Paimblanc said. `` We'll put the hospitals out of business if people keep eating like this.'' <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Israel </PERSON>'s director of nutritional services, said research is still ongoing on direct correlations between fish oils and lower incidence of cardiac problems.

<HEAD>Orders State to Buy Recycled Goods, Drop Polystyrene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has ordered the state government to use recycled goods and stop buying polystyrene products, an action that won the praise of environmentalists. `` It is time for us to get away from the notion of a throwaway society and to do everything possible to promote use of recycled and recyclable products,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Wednesday in a statement that aides admitted was printed on nonrecycled paper. The Democratic presidential front-runner signed an executive order to phase out the purchase of polystyrene, whose production has been blamed for harming the Earth's ozone layer. The order came one day after a Canadian researcher warned that a hole in the ozone layer may be developing above the North Pole. Earlier studies identified a seasonal hole over the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> in the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful solar radiation. Scientists have attributed the potentially damaging ozone loss to chemical reactions touched off by chlorofluorocarbons, a family of chemicals used in making plastic foam. The foam, known as polystyrene and sold widely under the trade name <PERSON> Styrofoam </PERSON>, was the target of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' order. Under its terms, the state purchasing agent was told to immediately stop buying disposable polystyrene products manufactured with chlorofluorocarbons. As of June 1, the state will stop buying polystyrene products that are not made from recycled materials. State officials said recycled plastic foam is not considered a threat to ozone. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also ordered the state purchasing agent to expand purchases of recycled paper, recycled aluminum and recycled low-grade plastic products such as trash bags. In addition, the state will begin using `` composted soil supplements'' in parks and roadsides wherever compost is available and appropriate. `` What we have here is another example of how economic growth can be combined with a commitment to the environment and high standards of environmental protection,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters at a <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> news conference. On Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won praise from environmentalists by joining Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., in calling for an expanded moratorium on exploratory oil drilling off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coast On Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his goal was to boost the recycling industry by expanding the supply of recyclable materials and the market for recycled products. Aides said the state's purchases of paper, aluminum and plastic amount to millions of dollars annually. According to the governor's staff, the state will incur a slightly higher cost for purchases of recycled paper and an increase of 5 percent or more on recycled aluminum. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> earlier banned state purchases of polystyrene, and 11 states have programs to encourage government purchase of recycled materials, according to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> environmental officials. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> lawmakers recently banned the manufacture and sale of foam products made with chlorofluorocarbons in the state starting in 1990. But the packaging industry views the law as symbolic since no such products are made in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shope </PERSON>, of the Environmental Lobby of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said the new policy puts <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in the forefront of recycling and noted that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has yet to adopt a similar requirement. `` Who knows? Maybe next year that will change,'' she said, referring to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential campaign.

 The British may have to discard their cherished good manners to combat littering, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Tidy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Britain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I'm beginning to think we've been nice about it for a little bit too long,'' Lord <PERSON> Parry </PERSON> told a conference Wednesday sponsored by the anti-litter organization. <PERSON> Parry </PERSON> called for tougher enforcement of anti-littering laws. The law permits fines of more than $ 700 for littering, but in 1986, the average fine imposed was less than $ 60. <PERSON> Parry </PERSON> also suggested hiring wardens to ticket litterers, much like meter maids ticket parking violators, and producing a `` black book'' illustrating a community's litterers or even awarding a `` booby prize'' to the worst.

The <ORGANIZATION> Bukovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a lobby group for Soviet dissidents, released excerpts of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s letter translated into English at its annual <ORGANIZATION> Sakharov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, saying it was written in April but never publicized. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was invited but did not attend the conference on `` Blank Spots in Soviet History,'' the Amsterdam-based organization said.

Expelled Soviet dissident <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukovsky </PERSON>, for whom the foundation is named, on Wednesday predicted that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will have to increase consumer prices, and that could lead to unrest in Soviet society. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> soon after receiving the letter that it would be published in the popular English-language weekly <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News if the dissident was willing to `` soften some of his language,'' the foundation said in a preface to the letter. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> refused, the foundation said. It added that the letter was signed `` with deep and sincere respect.'' The letter referred to clashes in February between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanis in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region, where dozens of people died. `` In the context of perestroika, the Armenian population of <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> raised its hopes that there may be a constitutional solution to the problem,'' said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s letter. `` Glasnost,'' openness on selected social topics, and `` perestroika,'' restructuring, are key elements of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program to reform the Soviet society and economy

<TEXT>
 The leftist Sandinista government and the rebels have tentatively agreed to hold a third round of talks in hopes of securing a lasting peace, the government announced. A communique issued Wednesday night said the U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras, have agreed to a government proposal to hold the talks May 25-28 at an as yet undetermined location. The agreement was reached at meetings Tuesday and Wednesday between deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, one of the five directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance. The meeting was held in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where the Contras are based. According to the communique, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> proposed that the third meeting be held in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, as the previous two had been, but the Contras appeared reluctant and delayed the decision on a site. Rebel leaders had complained that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> restricted their delegates to a hotel during the previous two meetings, refusing to allow them to meet with domestic opposition political leaders. On March 23, the two sides signed a preliminary peace accord in the southern border post of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> and a cease-fire that ends May 30 took effect. During the truce, the belligerents were to meet in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and try to end the civil war that began in 1982 and has claimed more than 26,500 lives. Since the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> accords, the two sides have delineated seven cease-fire zones into which the rebels are to move. But they remain far apart on issues of democratic reforms and what role Contra leaders will be permitted to assume in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s political future. Until those issues are settled, the Contras say their fighters will not enter the cease-fire zones and lay down their weapons. If peace talks do not resume by June 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have threatened to mount an all-out offensive to try to wipe out the rebels.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s agricultural heartland today, sounding environmental and farming themes as he searched for votes in the June 7 primary. At a stop in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> Wednesday night, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> suggested that past comments by `` irresponsible public leaders'' could have helped set the stage for an alleged assassination plot against him. A <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> couple, <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, were charged this week with conspiring to kill <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. According to court papers, <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told an informant he was a white supremacist, but investigators said they had not found evidence linking him to any organized white supremacist group. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> suggested that racial hatred could have been fueled by statements made during last month's raucous primary campaign in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> harshly and at one point said Jews would be `` crazy'' to vote for him. `` The climate for this kind of antagonism and violence, of course, has been set by many irresponsible public leaders -LRB- whose -RRB- attacks based on race have set a divisive and dangerous climate, such as the one ... in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in April, for example,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters. However, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> vowed not to `` lower the tone of my campaign, adding: `` I will keep dreaming.'' <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, in an interview published today in the <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> News-Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I did not conspire with anyone to kill any presidential candidate, especially <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' `` I'm sorry that this mess has been brought up,'' he said. `` This is a very bad mistake. I'm really sorry the man -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- has to hear anything like this. The man should not be afraid of anything from me ... I could care less if he's elected president or not.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose relations with the Jewish community have been strained in the past, met Wednesday with some three dozen rabbis and Jewish leaders. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was beginning the day today in <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, with stops set later in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> received a warm welcome at <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>'s Saroyan Theater from a crowd of about 3,000, including toddler <PERSON> Jonathon </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. Last year, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> taped a public service announcement to appeal for a new liver for the boy, then 10 months old, who needed the transplant to survive. The child received the donor liver last May and will celebrate his second birthday next month. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> hoisted the boy in his arms during the speech and told the crowd of the `` challenge to save our children'' by putting a higher priority on education and social programs. After the rally, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reiterated his support for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>' boycott on table grapes. And, questioned about cleanup of pesticide contamination in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> wells, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied, `` It does not require additional laws, it just requires commitments and enforcement.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration record on environmental and worker safety laws as `` scandalous.''

<TEXT>
 If you've got a big brain, a yen for the indoors and little love of glamour or rawboned rigor, then <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has just the right job for you, according to the publishers of `` The Jobs Rated Almanac.'' Ranked as the best of 250 American jobs is a career few children are likely to have heard of, much less name: an actuary. Next are computer programmer, computer systems analyst, mathematician and statistician. Typical, more glamorous children's career choices like being a dancer, doctor or astronaut also fared poorly in the almanac's overall listing because they rated at or near the bottom in at least one of the six ranking criteria According to the almanac, published this month by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> References </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the worst job listed in the ranking was migrant worker, which rated near or at the bottom in all six of the criteria. The second worst _ commercial fishing _ also was ranked low because of long hours, seasonal work, high government regulation and tough physical demands. That was followed by construction worker, roofer, seaman, dairy farmer, roustabout, lumberjack, cowboy and professional football player. Almanac Editor and <PERSON> Publisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Krantz </PERSON> identified the criteria used to judge jobs as salary, stress, work environment, outlook, security and physical demands. `` Most of the best paying jobs are performed in highly competitive and physically confining environments for long hours,'' <PERSON> Krantz </PERSON> said. `` Do n't expect a cushy job if you want to earn more than $ 50,000 a year.'' But ultimately, he added, `` The job best for an individual is the one the person likes the best, and that depends a lot on someone's priorities.'' Astronauts have the worst working environment, with surgeons second, the book concluded. Firefighters have the longest work weeks and their jobs are the most stressful and physically demanding, it said. But actuaries _ who interpret statistics to determine expected personal losses due to sickness or disability and material losses from disasters _ did well in all six categories. A 23-year old actuary in training, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, said he agreed with the assessment. `` Once the -LRB- training -RRB- exams are over, I'd say the stress would be pretty much non-existent, and the job market is so open I could just walk out and find a new job in a day,'' he said. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, who works for <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION>, said his $ 31,000 annual salary `` was probably 20 to 25 percent higher than any other job I could have gotten, and it goes up faster.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermes </PERSON>, a fisherman for 47 years, said he was n't bothered by his job's low ranking and could n't imagine making a living any other way `` It's the only job I've ever wanted,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Hermes </ORGANIZATION>, 62, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DeNoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` You're out in the open, you're your own boss and you do n't have to answer to nobody.'' <PERSON> Krantz </PERSON> said most of the information for the almanac comes from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, but tracking down some statistics, like a cowboy's wages, took some legwork. `` We literally called cattle ranches and they told us: ` Well, if you have a good horse you can make about $ 150 a week,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, pointing to the need to reduce the federal deficit, says he supports congressional attempts to close unneeded military bases. `` It makes sense to look seriously now at closing bases, because our military force structure is being reduced and growth in the defense budget is being slowed,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Wednesday. `` We must stop spending money to operate bases we do not need,'' he said. `` Our increasingly scarce resources simply must be applied to higher defense priorities, so that we do not jeopardize <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s national security interests.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was testifying in support of a plan designed to surmount the strong reluctance of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to allow military bases to be closed. It calls for creation of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> commission to review bases by Dec. 31 and recommend a list of which can be closed. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> would then have 15 days to accept or reject the entire list. His decision would be made less than a week before the end of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term in office. The Pentagon estimates $ 2 billion to $ 5 billion could be saved by closing the unneeded bases.

 A mob of neighbors chased down and apprehended a man accused of breaking into a home and raping a 7-year-old girl in front of her 5-year-old sister, authorities say. One of the neighbors said later that if they had known why they were chasing the man, they might have killed him. The man, a parolee who was once accused of making a telephone threat against the life of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, was chased for about four blocks by about eight people, surrounded and held until police arrived, officers said. `` I think we basically got there before anybody had a chance to lay into him,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Staney </PERSON> of the Juvenile Division. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, 42, was being held in the <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail today in lieu of $ 20,000 bond on charges of burglary and aggravated sexual assault of a child. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is accused of climbing through a window of a house late Tuesday and sexually assaulting the girl in her bedroom, <PERSON> Staney </PERSON> said. Her 5-year-old sister was in the room and saw the attack, he added. The victim was released Wednesday from <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taub </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The girls were alone in the house while their mother worked at her evening-shift job, <PERSON> Staney </PERSON> said. She normally had a babysitter stay with the girls, but she told police she had no money to pay the sitter this week and left them at home with a padlock on the front door, he said. The girls' father does not live with the family, <PERSON> Staney </PERSON> said. Neighbors saw <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> climbing back out the window and heard the girls frantically screaming, <PERSON> Staney </PERSON> said. `` It's a mostly Hispanic neighborhood, so when the neighbors saw this big white guy coming out the window, they knew he did n't belong there,'' he said <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> did not resist and was not harmed by the neighbors, <PERSON> Staney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, one of the people who chased the man, said they heard someone yelling and ran toward the house. `` We were behind him. There were about eight of us,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. `` We were trying to catch him, but we really did n't know exactly why,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, 43, said. `` If we had known what had happened he might have died.'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> started crying after he was caught. `` He just started crying, crying like a baby,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a welder, told police he did n't remember assaulting the girl, <PERSON> Staney </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> was charged in August 1984 after calling the local <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secret Service and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> offices from a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> telephone booth and making a threat against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, police said.

 Ousted Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, whose criminal trial was scheduled to begin today, has been barred from speaking at <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> because of questions about his honesty. `` We have n't decided that <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is guilty, but now is not the appropriate time for him to appear on campus,'' said <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Harker </PERSON>, a spokesman for the university that's operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who is a Mormon, had been scheduled to speak at the <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, campus on May 26 or 27, in an appearance sponsored by Campus Republicans, a student group. `` We do not allow to speak on campus people who are not worthy examples,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanesworth </PERSON>, a communications professor and the group's faculty adviser. `` I thought it was clear that he did not meet the criteria'' on which speakers may appear at <ORGANIZATION> BYU </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was n't an effort to say ` Here's Governor <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. He's a great guy and the people of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> -LRB- treated him unfairly. -RRB-' It was an effort to say, ` Governor <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, here's a chance to explain yourself and give one side of the issue,''' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodwell </PERSON>, president of the Campus Republicans. School policy says that in order to appear at <ORGANIZATION> BYU </ORGANIZATION>, a speaker `` must not, in his or her personal life -LRB- as reflected in the news media and common understanding of the public -RRB-, have committed acts of immorality, dishonesty or other conduct that would make it inappropriate for the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> to feature him or her as a speaker. `` His or her life and advice should make an appropriate model for students in an educational system with our ideals.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, said Wednesday he is not upset by the decision barring him from speaking on the campus. `` I do n't get too upset about anything,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said. `` It was just a group of young Republicans who wanted me to speak. If they have a policy, they have a policy, and I wo n't speak.'' <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> said one reason for not permitting <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> to appear is that he is under indictment and his trial on charges that he concealed a $ 350,000 campaign contribution was about to begin. `` When a person is involved in -LRB- a court case -RRB-, if he comes to speak, that would imply an endorsement by the university,'' <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> said. `` People would say, ` Oh, he's speaking at <ORGANIZATION> BYU </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Protesters battled riot troopers with firebombs and rocks in the center of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for a third day today after police broke up a funeral march with volleys of tear gas. The demonstrators called for an end to President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government and demanded that the 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact be forced to leave Clashes began when riot police fired volleys of tear gas to break up thousands of students trying to march past City Hall. The huge crowd fled as showers of tear-gas bombs exploded in its ranks. Students retaliated with firebombs, rocks and bricks and battled police for control of the city's main shopping area. Firebombs exploded against buildings and among squads of riot police. `` Down with the military dictatorship'' and `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>,'' protesters screamed as they hurled rocks at police. Riot police seized dozens of protesters and roughly hauled them away. Both sides hurled rocks at and hit each other. Police declined to give any figures on arrests or casualties. It was the worst rioting in several months. In the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, 3,000 students yelling anti-government slogans battled riot police with firebombs and rocks today at <ORGANIZATION> Chonnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The battle began when police fired tear gas to stop the students marching into the streets. Fighting started in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after authorities allowed 25,000 people to march and stage rallies for more than five hours in memory of <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung-man </PERSON>, a student who committed suicide on Sunday in a ritual form of anti-government protest sometimes used by radicals. His body was to be taken to <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> for burial. The funeral procession marched through the center of the city, snarling traffic for miles. `` Down with the murder regime,'' marchers shouted as musicians in white mourning clothes beat drums and cymbals. Singers chanted dirges and dancers in white performed a ghost dance. `` We will never end our struggle until we destroy <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s regime,'' said one angry woman student The march ended in front of City Hall, where protesters burned an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag as speakers denounced the government. Marchers were to disperse under an agreement with police, but many started to march again and police attacked. Black police armored vans fired salvos of exploding tear gas bombs into the marchers and hundreds of cars were stranded in the sprawling City Hall square. About 5,000 riot police in green combat fatigues poured into the streets and chased fleeing students. Students seized several nearby streets and set fire to part of a subway station and some shops as they hurled firebombs at police. Terrified pedestrians fled, many choking from the tear gas. Shopkeepers locked their doors and sidewalk vendors abandoned their stalls. Fighting swirled around several luxury hotels in the city center and frightened foreign tourists looked on in astonishment or ran for cover. Firebombs set ablaze a roof garden at the <LOCATION> Lotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> and fire trucks forced their way through the fighting to extinguish the fire. It was the third day in a row that the center of the city had been hit by rioting. Protests began Tuesday to honor <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> and mark Wednesday's eighth anniversary of the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising in 1980. Opposition leaders are pressing for an investigation into the suppression of that anti-government uprising during which at least 191 people were killed. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was a senior general at the time and the opposition wants his role in the incident probed. Protesters repeatedly denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, charging it maintains military rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and is responsible for the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. `` Unite the motherland,'' they yelled The Korean peninsula was divided by Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces at the end of clash. The south and communist north remain bitter enemies and often clash. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who took office Feb. 25 after winning elections in December, has introduced broad democratic and liberal reforms. But many Koreans distrust him because of his ties to past authoritarian regimes.

It could only be total liberation if I was in my home and my country was free.'' <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> is accused of helping plan the September 1983 robbery of a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> to finance <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION> _ Spanish for `` the machete wielders'' _ a violent group seeking Puerto Rican independence. <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> rejected a prosecution request that he set bond at $ 2.5 million, but imposed sharp restrictions on <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON>'s movements once he is released. <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> must wear an electronic bracelet that will tell authorities where he is, must live in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> and will be able to move around the city only between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> rejected the government's request that <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> be confined to a defense attorney's home and a defense request that he be allowed to return to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to convalesce from triple-bypass heart surgery April 11.

 The Sikh elders who manage the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> were called into session today to discuss reopening the golden-domed shrine where a 10-day police siege ended with the surrender of militant Sikh separatists. The 400-year-old temple, <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine, had become a base for extremists waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for an independent Sikh homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. Forty-five men and one woman walked out of the temple on Wednesday, their hands in the air or clasped on their heads, and surrendered to the 2,800 policemen, commandos and paramilitary troops surrounding it. At least 42 people, mostly militant Sikhs, were killed during the siege. Four other militants committed suicide rather than surrender. <PERSON> Bhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> elders' committee that runs the temple, told reporters late Wednesday night that it would today discuss how to restore daily religious rites at the shrine. A curfew remained in effect today within 300 yards of the complex's walls and municipal workers began cleaning its dining hall, hostels and offices. Despite the government's success in ending the siege, its authority is still challenged by continuing Sikh attacks elsewhere in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said today that 13 more people were killed during the night around the northern state in attacks by Sikh extremists, who killed at least 99 people in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> while the siege was under way. At least 40 people were killed Tuesday and Wednesday, including more than 30 migrant Hindu laborers shot to death as they slept at a camp near the state capital of <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. A note found near the laborers' bodies said the killings were to avenge the Golden Temple siege. So far this year, at least 1,076 killings in the state have been blamed on Sikh gunmen. In all of 1987, the militants killed about 1,030 people in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Sikh militants say they need a separate homeland to preserve their faith and combat what they call discrimination by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Hindu majority Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, comprise less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people but are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The temple siege began May 9 after Sikh gunmen fired from inside the complex at a party of police commanders who were on an inspection tour outside its walls. Five of the officers were wounded. Eight hundred pilgrims and temple workers were evacuated the following day and security forces proceeded to fire hundreds of rounds at the temple complex's office and residential buildings. They were, however, under orders not to hit the temple itself. On Sunday, 146 people including a number of wanted Sikh extremists surrendered during a cease-fire. The last of the hard-core militants gave up on Wednesday. <PERSON> Sidharth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, called it `` a day of great relief'' but added: `` It is neither victory nor defeat.'' He urged Sikh gunmen throughout <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> to turn themselves in and pledged to restore religious rites at the temple as soon as possible. The siege was the largest show of force at the temple since June 1984, when Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> had the army storm the complex to oust armed Sikhs. More than 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs, died in the onslaught. Many Sikhs considered the raid the worst sort of desecration, and it was avenged less than five months later when Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s son and successor as prime minister, <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, said on Wednesday that the carrying of arms in the temple should be banned. He also told reporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> that he thought most of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Sikh community had supported the siege.

 Soviet officials today reluctantly allowed Japanese investigators to search a portion of a Soviet passenger ship to determine what caused a fire that killed at least 11 people and injured 35. After 70 minutes of heated negotiations with Soviet consular officials, police agreed to pare down to 15 a team originally consisting of more than 60 investigators. Police also gave in to Soviet demands that the probe be limited to the passenger cabins of the 4,870-ton Priamurye, gutted by a fire on Wednesday. All of the 129 crew members and 295 passengers listed in the ship's registers were Soviet nationals, and all of the dead were passengers. `` I have no idea why they -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- demanded this and I do n't really understand what the problem is with them,'' said <PERSON> Yoshihide </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasuda </PERSON>, a police official in charge of the investigation. `` But the fact remains that our investigations are limited ... and may not be carried out as expected,'' <ORGANIZATION> Yasuda </ORGANIZATION> said at a news briefing. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Yasuda </ORGANIZATION> said police and firefighters had been through the gutted ship in a preliminary probe, but the Soviets asked them not to enter the engine room. Police had said the fire was discovered in an area above the engine room. It took 18 hours for firefighters to put out the blaze aboard the Priamurye, which was blackened and listing at dock in this port city of western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The investigative team, clad in boots and overalls and equipped with cameras and flashlights, entered the ship at 10:43 a.m. <ORGANIZATION> Yasuda </ORGANIZATION> said the 10 police, three fire department and two Maritime Agency specialists will concentrate on a cluster of cabins on the second deck, one level below the main deck, where nine of the 11 bodies were found. Maritime official <PERSON> Norimasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, in charge of emergency measures, said earlier that a cigarette or faulty lighting could have started the fire, which gutted most of the 85-cabin ship registered in <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Osaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials contacted by telephone said 15 of the original 35 injured in the fire remained hospitalized this afternoon. <PERSON> Yasuda </PERSON> described as `` uncooperative'' the attitude of both Soviet consulate officials and ship captain <PERSON> Aleksandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Yerastov </PERSON>. He said there was little likelihood that investigations could be completed prior to the arrival of a Soviet vessel to take back survivors. Soviet crew members, including about 50 who had remained on board the ship overnight despite police objections, began loading food and beverage supplies to prepare to pull out as early as Friday, officials at the site said. The Piramurye pulled into <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> port Tuesday after calling on <LOCATION> Otaru </LOCATION>, Hokkaido May 8 and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> May 12. The vessel was to leave for <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> tonight. Maritime officials said the passengers, many of them in their 20s and early 30s, were visiting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for sightseeing purposes as part of the Sputnik youth group tour, organized by the Soviet Communist Youth League.

 Undercover agents broke up an alleged conspiracy to funnel 1,000 pounds of cocaine every 48 hours for a month into a swanky <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> summer retreat, in one of three separate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug busts that netted 17 arrests. In other actions Wednesday, Customs agents said a patrol vessel chased down a high-speed boat running without lights in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> just before dawn and found more than 2 tons of cocaine aboard. Three <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> men and a <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> national were arrested and their 38-foot boat confiscated, said Customs spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. In Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, federal authorities charged four people, including a West German couple, with possession of 1 -LCB- tons of marijuana and 236 pounds of a substance believed to be hashish oil, with a combined street value of more than $ 20 million. Customs agent <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the drugs were smuggled into the Gulf Coast from a foreign distribution point apparently aboard a 35-foot sailboat. The plot to sell 8 tons of cocaine in the <LOCATION> Hamptons </LOCATION>, a chic beach retreat on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, came to light when undercover agents learned of an attempt to get a plane for flights between <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, officials said. `` This seizure is unbelievable, out of sight,'' said state police Capt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Heesch </PERSON>. `` It has not only put a major dent into the importation of cocaine to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> but it has more significantly removed the major players.'' The first shipment, which contained 1,200 pounds of cocaine, was seized Tuesday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> when the plane transporting it lost an engine and had to land, officials said. The plane, which was headed for <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Westhampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, had been under surveillance since leaving <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The pilot, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pekarchik </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, was arrested in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and eight others, including two Colombians, were arrested Wednesday on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. All were charged with conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine. <PERSON> Heesch </PERSON>, head of the special investigations bureau, estimated that the 1,200 pounds of cocaine could have been sold for $ 80 million. Undercover agents infiltrated the plot by arranging for a jet between <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and helping handle the logistics of the smuggling operation, using electronic surveillance throughout the negotiations. Special Customs Agent <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON> said the smuggling ring had planned to bring in 1,000 pounds of cocaine every 48 hours for 30 days, stockpile it at various sites on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and sell it in the Hamptons. `` We got them on their first run,'' said <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON>. `` They were just gearing up so they had enough supplies during the peak sale period of the summer.'' In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, meanwhile, youthful-looking undercover officers posing as high school students made more than 230 drug buys and arrested 171 drug dealers recently, Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said Wednesday. Of those arrested in undercover operations at 10 high schools, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said 46 were gang members. Of the total arrested, 104 were younger than 18 years old, and of those, 101 were students. Drugs seized by police, mostly high potency marijuana, were valued at about $ 114,330, the chief said.

 Jurors in the cocaine-smuggling trial of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> watched a videotape in which the reputed Colombian cocaine lord called drugs a `` revolutionary'' weapon against North American imperialism. The jury were scheduled to return today for their seventh day of deliberations in the 7-month-old trial. On Wednesday, the jury reviewed a tape made by <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in 1985 when he was a fugitive in the jungles of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, as well as a June 29, 1983, television tape that a clean-cut <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> made when he was running for the Colombian <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. In the jungle tape, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> said, `` This is about political action and cocaine has become, and marijuana has become, a revolutionary weapon in the struggle against North American imperialism. Stimulants from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are the Achilles' heel of imperialism.'' However, added <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, who prosecutors say has neo-Nazi views, `` I have never admitted that I have dealt or done any business with drugs.'' On the jungle tape, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is dressed in a sleeveless T-shirt and sleeveless denim jacket and has long, stringy hair, in sharp contrast to his short hair and business suit image in court. The last time the jury communicated with the court before Wednesday was Saturday, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> denied requests for the testimony of three prosecution witnesses. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> appeared weary in court Wednesday. His brother, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, an economist in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, said he had been able to visit the defendant during deliberations. `` He's very positive, energetic. He's feeling well. He's in a good mood,'' the brother said. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, and co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, are charged with conspiring to smuggle 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, using <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, from 1978 to 1980. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy, two counts of importation of cocaine, seven counts of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and one charge of engaging in a continuing criminal enteprise. If convicted, he could receive life plus 150 years in prison and up to $ 350,000 in fines and forfeiture of his assets in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is charged with a single conspiracy count and faces up to 15 years in prison and $ 25,000 in fines if convicted.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> dropped nearly 400 points today for its biggest single-day decline this year, while the dollar declined in narrow trading against the yen. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues closed at 27,373.24, falling 394.34 points, or 1.42 percent. On Wednesday the index shed 52.40 points. `` Apprehensions about possible inflation and rising interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> outweighed the expectations produced by the dramatically reduced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit,'' said <PERSON> Keiji </PERSON> <PERSON> Arai </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sanyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported the nation's trade deficit fell more than $ 4 billion in March to $ 9.7 billion, the lowest monthly finish since March 1985 Compared with Wall Street, what the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market lost was smaller, but if Wall Street continue to sag, pulling the Dow Jones industrial average below the 1,700-point level, investors will be forced to `` give a second thought about the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market as well,'' he said. Steels and shipbuildings were under strong selling pressure. Electricals, chemicals, non-ferrous metals also lost ground. Certain precision metals and drugs were higher. Volume on the first section trading was esimated at 1 billion shares, down from the 1.2 billion shares that changed hands on Wednesday. After opening the day at 125.00 yen, down 0.53 yen from Wednesday's finish, the dollar dipped further and closed at 124.80 yen, down 0.73 yen. `` The dollar's lower opening followed its decline against the yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading,'' said an exchange dealer at a major commercial bank. The dollar buying by trading houses in the morning was outpaced by selling in the afternoon by export-related industries, said the dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trading was relatively quiet, however, and the dollar traded in a narrow range between 125.00 yen to 124.75 yen without incentives to prompt major movements among participants, he added.

 <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, a week into using his own material because of the scriptwriters' strike, quipped on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Tonight Show'' that he had seen pictures of his writers on milk cartons <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> was in fine form Wednesday, entering the second week of writing his own monologue and material after returning to the air despite the strike that began March 7. He remarked that he had started the day with a bowl of cold cereal. `` My writers' pictures were on the milk cartons,'' he said, referring to the cartons that often contain information about missing children. A standard gag about his longtime friend <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> filled out the repertoire. He joked that <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> was helping to fight the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> water shortage by taking his scotch and water without water. `` That ought to be enough to turn the <LOCATION> Kalahari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> green,'' he said. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> also joked about Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and the `` kiss and tell'' books about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, Surgeon General <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s declaration that tobacco is addictive, plus, of course, band leader <PERSON> Doc </PERSON> <PERSON> Severinsen </PERSON>'s colorful attire. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, despite the absence of his writers, was cooking. And the studio audience, unusually loud and boisterous, expressed its appreciation with yells, whoops, laughter and loud applause. He was at his best ad libbing answers to written questions from the audience and reacting to his guests. One viewer asked him when he first `` messed around.'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> replied, `` When I was 16, in the back seat of a'39 Chrysler. It was n't much fun. I was alone.'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s first guest was Dr. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gosliner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He brought with him a selection of mollusks. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> had noted that a bill was before the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to make the banana slug the state's official mollusk. The audience, after looking at such mollusks as the slug and the abalone, cast their vote for the sea hare. Other guests were comedian <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkenbauer </PERSON> and rock musician <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> returned to the air with `` The Tonight Show'' on May 11 after saying he would write his own material. The show had been in reruns since the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> walked out over issues of residual pay for reruns and creative rights.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s former president characterized a $ 1 million fee for two financial associates of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as a payoff. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> made the statement Wednesday in testimony for the prosecution in the trial of Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s former law partner and five others accused of turning the now bankrupt military contractor into a racketeering enterprise. <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> said <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s former financial adviser, told him the money was needed `` for friends in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he has to take care of.'' <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON>, asked <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> about a $ 1 million payment <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> made to <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> and a colleague, <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON>, to manipulate the company's stock. <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> testified: `` Mr. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> also came to whisper in my ear that he needs it for baksheesh, which means payoffs ... payola ... grease. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s former lawyer, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, have been indicted on charges of taking bribes for trying to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has not been indicted in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> case. The defense has been trying to show that <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s role in helping <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> win no-bid government contracts was insignificant compared to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s ties to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON>, the third <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executive to testify, backed up earlier testimony that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 300,000 to help defray <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s costs in defending <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> during his 1985 confirmation hearings. <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> if <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> asked for the $ 300,000 `` to assist in the defense of his friend <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'' during the confirmation hearings. `` Oh yes,'' <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> said. `` At that time, yes. He said to me, it's clear that he has n't got any income now because he is involved in the defense of Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and he needs help for that reason. So if we'd pay his expenses, which are very high in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> whether it was `` your belief that you were paying $ 300,000 to Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and, in effect, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was paying for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal representation?'' Replied Neuberger: `` That was my thought.''

 Signs of renewed vigor in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy are likely to play a role in determining the outcome of the November presidential election, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said today. `` My rosy predictions wo n't decide the election.

He said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was sticking to a forecast that the economy would expand by 2.4 percent this year and that inflation would hold near the current level of 4 percent. `` In our view at least, there is not going to be a resurgence of inflation,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` The economy is a major factor in any election, particularly in a presidential election.

 Iranian speedboats attacked a Norwegian tanker twice in the Strait of Hormuz today, firing rocket-propelled grenades that set the vessel afire and injured one crewman, shipping executives said. The 55,173-ton <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> <PERSON> Strand </PERSON>, an empty liquefied petroleum gas carrier sailing to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> ports, was the second vessel attacked by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in the last two days. Iranian speedboats raided the Japanese-owned Ace <PERSON> Chemi </PERSON> on Wednesday, following Iraqi attacks on Iranian terminals and tankers. The shipping executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> Berge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strand </LOCATION> was damaged slightly in the first attack by two speedboats, at 6:30 a.m. -LRB- 10:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday -RRB-. They did not know what weapons were used in the first strike but said no injuries were reported. An hour later, one of the speedboats caught up with the <LOCATION> Berge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strand </LOCATION> and pumped five rocket-propelled grenades into its accommodation quarters, then veered away, the sources said. A small fire broke out and flying shrapnel injured one of the 19 crew members in the face and forearm, the sources said. The crew, believed to be Norwegian, put out the fire. An Omani warship on patrol rushed to help the vessel and took the injured sailor to a hospital in <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, they said. His condition was not serious, they added. The <LOCATION> Berge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strand </LOCATION> headed to the southern gulf port of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, where the Ace <PERSON> Chemi </PERSON> is docked for repairs. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command, meanwhile, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s 32nd convoy of the year was sailing south through the gulf. It included one U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker, the 46,723-ton Gas Prince, escorted by the missile frigate <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>. A fire on the 6,730-ton Ace <PERSON> Chemi </PERSON> forced its Japanese captain and 16 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> crewmen to abandon ship. All were reported rescued by salvage tugs. The raid on the chemical tanker was the first by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> implemented a new policy May 3 that permits <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships to intervene in attacks on commercial vessels on request, regardless of the flag they are flying. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships were unable to respond to the Ace <PERSON> Chemi </PERSON> raid because the closest <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessel was 60 miles away, a two-hour sail, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources. The attacks on the Japanese and Norwegian ships occurred about 11 miles south of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s offshore <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> oil terminal, where Iraqi warplanes on Saturday devastated the world's largest tanker, the 564,739-ton <ORGANIZATION> Seawise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION>, and four other ships. The unofficial death toll stood at 34 after Iraqi F-1 Mirage jets streaked into <PERSON> Larak </PERSON> following a 750-mile run down the gulf. The Seawise Giant, chartered by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as a storage ship, had been unloading oil to the Spanish ship <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>. At <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION>, tankers pick up oil brought down the gulf by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fleet of shuttle tankers. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> has claimed a dozen raids, six of which were independently verified, on Iranian tankers and terminals since April 29. The raids seek to strangle oil exports that support <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s side of the 7 -LCB- - year-old gulf war Iranian officials recently declared that their policy of blow-for-blow retaliatory attacks on neutral shipping would continue, but Wednesday's was the first since April 24. About 350 seamen have been killed and hundreds of others injured in attacks on more than 500 vessels in gulf waterways in the spillover of the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> land war, which began in September 1980. In the ground war, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian forces killed or wounded 2,000 Iraqi troops and captured more than 10 square miles of northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in an operation that began Tuesday night. It said many Iraqi troops were taken prisoner. There was no comment from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

Fighting has been raging between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> since May 6 in the 16-square-mile slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Most of the 18 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed to be held by Hezbollah-backed Shiite zealots.

<HEAD>Report: If Planet Is To Survive, Humans Must Stop Plundering Its
Resources</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The earth will only be able to support its population in the coming century if all countries cooperate to reverse environmental destruction and control population growth, an annual <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report said. The 1988 State of World Population Report, released in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Wednesday, says increasing human demands and population are damaging the natural resources on which all life depends. The report says world population, now at more than 5 billion, is expected to reach 6.1 billion by the year 2000. `` All countries must face the fact that the combination of population and industrial growth could destroy the land, water and air on which everything else depends,'' Dr. <PERSON> Nafis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadik </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. The Pakistani physician expressed hope that action by governments, individuals and international organizations to curb population growth and encourage conservation will `` safeguard the future of our planet.'' But `` population and resources could become more seriously out of balance unless we do something about it today,'' she said. Every year, the world adds a nation the size of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to the population _ about 80 million people _ with nearly all the growth occurring in developing countries in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that are least able to absorb it, the report says. It says that though most developing countries are trying to reduce population growth, their needs are increasing and their attempts to find new land and increase food production are destroying the environment rapidly. `` There is urgent need for action ... In the poorest areas, the ` scissors effect' of poverty and increasing population is slicing away at their ability to sustain human life.'' The report encourages slower growth and more even distribution of population to take pressure off agricultural land, forests and water and energy sources. Tropical forests are shrinking at a rate of 27 million acres a year. Topsoil is being lost at the rate of 26 billion tons a year. About 13 million acres of deserts are being created each year and about half the world's irrigated land is in danger, it says. By the end of the century, half the world will be living in urban areas and one-fifth of the urban population will live in `` mega-cities'' of 4 million or more, the report says. It says population growth will not stop `` for perhaps another century, when world population may be over 10 billion, twice its present level. `` Part of this dramatic rise in numbers is the result of widespread improvements in basic health care which have contributed to lower infant mortality ... and longer life spans. But the very success of these interventions now threatens the future.''

<TEXT>
 Half the world's people will be city dwellers by the year 2000, and 11 of the world's 13 largest cities will be in the developing world, the 1988 State of World Population Report says. Since 1950, the number of city dwellers has almost tripled worldwide, reaching nearly 2 billion in 1985, according to the annual report released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Population Fund. It says the greatest increase has been in developing countries, where millions are flocking to urban areas in search of better education, health services and jobs. By the end of the century, 75 percent of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s population, 42 percent of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s and 37 percent of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s will be urban dwellers, the report adds The number of people living in cities of over 1 million also has grown rapidly. In 1940, one in 100 cities topped a million. In 1980, one in 10 cities contained more than a million people and in highly urbanized <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the present ratio is one in four, the report says. Eleven of the world's 13 most populous cities will be in the developing world by the end of century, compared with eight now, it adds. The 13 largest metropolitan areas in 1985 were: <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> -LRB- 18.8 million -RRB-, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> -LRB- 17.3 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> -LRB- 15.9 -RRB-, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -LRB- 15.6 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> -LRB- 11.8 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> -LRB- 11.0 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> -LRB- 10.9 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> -LRB- 10.4 -RRB-, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -LRB- 10.4 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> -LRB- 10.3 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> -LRB- 10.1 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> -LRB- 10.0 -RRB- and <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -LRB- 9.4 -RRB-.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell against most major foreign currencies in thin European trading this morning, and traders suggested it will remain in a narrow trading range for the rest of the week. Gold prices rose. Earlier, the dollar fell 0.73 yen to a closing of 124.80 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, in what traders said was a correction following sharp gains on the back of Tuesday's narrower-than-expected $ 9.75 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for March. `` The dollar overshot a reasonable range after the trade figures,'' said a currency dealer in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` But in ... <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it seems to have found a more sustainable level.'' Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday: -- 1.6988 West German marks, down from 1.7055 -- 1.4150 Swiss francs, down from 1.4215 -- 5.7517 French francs, down from 5.7700 -- 1.9022 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9090 -- 1,261.30 Italian lire, down from 1,265.50 -- 1.2434 Canadian dollars, up from 1.24125 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was also quoted at 124.75 yen, and one British pound cost $ 1.8660, more expensive for buyers than late Wednesday's $ 1.8605. Gold prices firmed in moderate European trading, boosted by Wednesday's gains in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, bullion dealers said. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 456.65 a troy ounce at midmorning, up from the opening bid of $ 455.50 and late Wednesday's $ 453.70. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 456.60, up from $ 454 late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 3.02 to close at a bid $ 457.56.

<HEAD>Court Ruling: Rabbis Must Let Woman Sit on Religious Council</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today overruled the nation's rabbis and upheld the appointment of the first woman to a religious council in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> The council's chairman in the southern town of <LOCATION> Yeroham </LOCATION> condemned the decision and threatened to resign if he is forced to implement it. The ruling of the three-justice panel marked an unusual intervention of secular courts in religious matters and followed a two-year battle by <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakdiel </PERSON>, 36, who was prevented by rabbis from accepting the appointment to her hometown council. The justices, who included a woman, <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Porat </PERSON>, ordered Mrs. <PERSON> Shakdiel </PERSON> appointed to the council within 30 days, saying the rabbis' action was based on `` considerations that are extraneous'' to Israeli law. Reacting to the ruling, an elated Mrs. <PERSON> Shakdiel </PERSON> told reporters at the court: `` I think this is a very big achievement for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, for religious Zionists and for women in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Shakdiel </PERSON> appealed to the court after Orthodox rabbis in <LOCATION> Yeroham </LOCATION>, a town of 6,000, refused to let her sit on the council. She was chosen for the position in March 1986 by left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> city councilors. Most Jewish communities in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have religious councils that administer synagogues, ritual baths and other religious affairs. The council members are chosen by local municipalities and are usually symbolically approved by the rabbis. But in <LOCATION> Yeroham </LOCATION>, the rabbis blocked Mrs. <PERSON> Shakdiel </PERSON>'s appointment on the grounds that Orthodox tradition bars women from taking an active role in public religious affairs, such as leading prayers or interpreting laws. The Orthodox rabbis have a monopoly on Jewish affairs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and sole authority to minister rituals such as marriages and divorces. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON>, a rabbi who heads <PERSON> Yeroham </PERSON>'s religious council responded with anger to the court ruling. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> can not force us to sit with a woman on the council. If the Religious Affairs Minister forces us then I will resign,'' <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> also criticized the court for intervening in religious matters. `` I do n't force the justices to wear yarmulkas -LRB- religious skull caps -RRB- so they ca n't force me to sit with a woman on my council.''

<HEAD>Editor Of Dissident Journal Says Police Shut It Down Through
Seizure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The editor of a well-known Soviet dissident journal said police held him for a week and seized the computer and printer he uses to produce the magazine as well as its archives. <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> security police `` even took all the pictures off the walls,'' <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> told reporters in his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment on Wednesday. The editor said that his arrest and detention show that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s promised reforms have not ended civil rights violations by the state security apparatus. The former political prisoner was arrested May 9 with four other people at a small country house he uses to produce his 11-month-old unofficial magazine, named Glasnost after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of more openness in society. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, a literary expert, said the officers had no arrest or search warrants, and a judge convicted him of `` malicous disobedience'' of a police officer and sentenced him to seven days in jail without a proper trial. `` It is a result of the demonstrably sharp deterioration in the situation in the country of people's rights,'' he said. The actions show that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for democratization of Soviet society and openness has not meant more tolerance of dissent, <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> was released from jail on Monday and the following day tried to visit the house in the village of <LOCATION> Kratkovo </LOCATION>, 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Police sealed off the house and prevented him from entering, saying he must prove to a prosecutor he has the right to live there and that his property wo n't be returned until he shows evidence it belongs to him. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said, however, that a prosecutor told him the matter should be taken up with the militia. `` It's not even clear to whom to turn,'' he said. The editors of Glasnost hope to continue publishing, but they are having trouble getting needed equipment and offices. Glasnost was the first privately controlled periodical to be published openly in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Past dissident magazines had been published clandestinely and many of their publishers were arrested. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> was sentenced in 1983 to 10 years in prison for writing for an underground bulletin on human rights. He was pardoned in February 1987. His arrest May 9 came hours before a group seeking to found a political party called the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> planned to meet in his offices. The group met instead at a nearby club to form the party, which seeks to challenge the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s political monopoly. The weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> has accused the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> of seeking to replace socialism with capitalism and called its members `` convinced enemies of our system, the political and economic system of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> calls for multiparty parliamentary democracy, independent trade unions, a new constitution and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and areas of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> seized in World War II.

 A new expedition led by the first man to conquer <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION> alone in winter ended less than 1,000 feet from the top when one climber apparently froze to death and three others suffered hypothermia. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>, 31, died early Wednesday at the 19,500-foot level of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s highest peak, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Two other members of the nine-person expedition were evacuated by helicopter. `` We had a beautiful experience turn into a nightmare,'' one exhausted climber, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, said as he clutched a hot cup of tea at <ORGANIZATION> Denali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> at the 14,000-foot level of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION>. `` It's unbelievable that one minute you can be on top of the world, and in the next minute under it,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. The expedition, which began about May 1, was led by veteran guide <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejas </PERSON>, who last March became the first mountaineer to survive a winter climb to <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>'s 20,320-foot summit. According to accounts from expedition members, <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> called a conference at about 8 p.m. Tuesday, after nearly 10 hours on the trail. They were still more than 1,000 feet below the summit. <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> warned that the approaching night would be bitterly cold. He told them to make individual decisions on whether to continue. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, at 57 the oldest member of the party, said he had intestinal cramps and decided to turn back with another man, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> sent assistant guide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swider </PERSON> to accompany them to the 17,200-foot camp. The others, led by <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION>, went on. Before the trio reached the haven, <PERSON> Swider </PERSON> fell on the steep, rocky terrain. He was saved from certain death only when <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> secured them using an ice ax. `` We all ended up in kind of a blob, hanging on, looking at each other, because the next step was really kind of a big one _ like a couple of thousand feet right off the ridge, going straight down,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. Other climbers saw the fall and went to the rescue. <PERSON> Swider </PERSON>, who had head lacerations and a back injury, and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> were helped back to camp, where they spent a long night worrying about their companions. The others had it even worse. Some 500 feet below the summit, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> began acting irrationally. It remains unclear whether she was ailing from hypothermia or some sort of altitude sickness, but she grew increasingly cold and unresponsive, the climbers said. While others worked desperately to warm her, <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> tried to dig a snow shelter in the icy, rocky terrain, but in a matter of minutes she was dead. `` She was such a strong supporter of <PERSON> Vern </PERSON>'s,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` She was practically on the trip because of him'' after hearing him describe his mountain experiences at a talk in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was assisted down the mountain Wednesday evening by other climbers. He was treated for three frostbitten toes. <PERSON> Swider </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, who had severely frostbitten feet, were flown off the mountain to a hospital in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. Tejas remained with the rest of the expedition at 17,200 feet. Two reportedly were recovering well from hypothermia. `` I felt like we had the best guide in the world,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` He did everything in the world a human being could be expected to do in a dangerous occupation like this.''

<HEAD>Frat Suspended for Hanging Battered Female Mannequin From Balcony</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The president of <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> suspended a fraternity for hanging a battered female mannequin splattered with red paint from a balcony during a toga party earlier this month. College President <PERSON> Olin </PERSON> <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> on Wednesday accepted the recommendation of the school's community council to ban the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upsilon </ORGANIZATION> fraternity from living in its house next year or functioning as a social organization. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upsilon </ORGANIZATION> also must participate in a sexism awareness course, said college spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nief </PERSON>. The fraternity was deluged with criticism last week after several students complained about the mannequin used as a decoration at the party. The mannequin's breasts were mutilated and splattered with red paint, and its head and face were bashed in, according to a letter of complaint seven students wrote to <PERSON> Robison </PERSON>. The action was characterized as being sexist and insensitive to violent crimes against women. In a statement, <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> said, `` It is at just such times as this that we recognize how very much our community depends upon a shared acknowledgement of the limits of permissable behavior. `` Our very survival as a community of learning requires both a generous amount of tolerance and a concomitant willingness to insist that there is ... a point beyond which our tolerance can not and must not be stretched,'' <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> said. `` This recent episode has defined, and defined appropriately, such a limit.'' The fraternity called the council's decision too severe. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, one of the students who complained, said she was pleased that a sexism awareness program would result from the complaint. After the end of the school year, the council will decide whether the fraternity should be placed on probation, suspended for another year or closed. The council is made up of students, faculty and staff members.

The students were arrested last month, and are free on bond. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oltarsh </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> were charged with sexual battery. <PERSON> Oltarsh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McPharlin </PERSON>, 19, of Plantation were charged with kidnapping to facilitate the commission of a felony. <PERSON> Oltarsh </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FSU </ORGANIZATION> student, was charged with battery in the scrawling of a fraternity symbol and other writing on the woman's leg and with aiding in the possession of alcohol by a person under 21 The indictment alleged that <PERSON> McPharlin </PERSON>, the Auburn student, and <PERSON> Oltarsh </PERSON> carried the victim, who had passed out and was near death from alcohol intoxication, from the <LOCATION> Pi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kappa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> house to a neighboring frat house, where they abandoned her. The victim was hospitalized for treatment of scratches, bruises and abrasions. Following the indictment, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Orians </PERSON>, the fraternity's national executive vice president in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> FSU </ORGANIZATION> chapter had been suspended and that an undetermined number of its members would be expelled The grand jury, which had complained in an interim report that fraternity members had been uncooperative, reiterated the complaint in a final report Wednesday. After the interim report and a university order disbanding the fraternity for five years, a fraternity member stepped forward, the grand jury said. Information from the fraternity member led to two of the arrests, and another frat member who admitted involvement in the incident was granted immunity in exchange for information leading to the third arrest. According to the grand jury, the informant described sexual activities all four had with the woman, and said they dressed her as she sat slumped on the floor. He said they verbally abused her and repeatdly told her they were members of another fraternity and that they were in that fraternity's house, the panel said. The victim admitted she violated the state's drinking age law against consumption by those under 21, but the grand jury urged she not be prosecuted because of the circumstances. The panel recommended that university police monitor areas where there is drinking, and urged <ORGANIZATION> FSU </ORGANIZATION> administrators to establish a mandatory first-semester orientation course on date rape, drug and alcohol abuse, personal safety and the availability of counseling services. University President <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliger </PERSON> thanked the grand jury for its recommendations, and said he had already directed <ORGANIZATION> FSU </ORGANIZATION> officials to take actions requested by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION>. `` This university has made it clear it will not tolerate conduct which demeans the human spirit,'' <PERSON> Sliger </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Olin </PERSON> <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> suspended the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upsilon </ORGANIZATION> fraternity for using a female mannequin that had been battered, mutilated and spattered with red paint as a decoration at a toga party. The fraternity was heavily criticized after students complained about the mannequin.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> said the armed forces will carry out any anti-drug assignments that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decides upon, but he warned the practice could compromise civil rights. `` Putting an end to the drug problem would be much broader than our mission,'' Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said at a news conference Wednesday before a luncheon speech to the Economic Club of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` I think there are things we can do, primarily identification, surveillance and tracking of people bringing in drugs in illicit fashion,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. But, he warned, `` to solve the drug problem and still guarantee all Americans the rights and privileges they enjoy today is a difficult thing. ... To truly stop the flow of drugs you would have to increase police powers and do some searches and seizures that are not contemplated today.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week approved a provision giving the military an expanded role in stopping drug smuggling, including new arrest powers for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers aboard warships that stop suspected drug boats on the high seas. The House has passed a more far-reaching provision, ordering the president to have the military essentially seal off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders against illegal drug trafficking. The provisions were attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s budget, which is being debated on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> also said he did not expect increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military activity in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would force the exit of its leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The admiral said he did not know when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement might end in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` I do not see any short-term or long-term end to the Iran-Iraq war,'' he said, adding that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is committed to protecting shipping in the gulf. `` As long as those interests are in jeopardy, we will be there,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. `` Of course, the government never said it would be a short-term operation.''

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she will convene her Cabinet's crisis committee to discuss the implications of a summons a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> court issued to her ousted predecessor, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters on Wednesday that she would convene the committee soon to discuss the summons issued on Tuesday by the anti-graft court, the Sandiganbayan. The summons stems from a $ 2.5 billion lawsuit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Good Government to recover some of the $ 10 billion it alleges <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> stole during his 20 years in office. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has barred <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from returning from Hawaiian exile to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, from which he was forced in a February 1986 popular uprising. Government sources said the committee must study the legal implications of the lawsuit, including whether the summons can be served on <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and if so, whether he has a legal right to return to answer the charges. A source at the anti-graft court said on condition of anonymity that the summons was forwarded to the Department of Foreign Affairs but had not yet been sent on to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. The source said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> could respond in writing within 60 days of receiving the order. Legal sources said it was not clear whether <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> could demand to answer the charges personally in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, police fired tear gas and smoke bombs to halt a rally and march to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> by protesters demanding that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> be allowed to return for his mother's funeral. Organizers said at least four women and two children were hurt. Police said there were minor injuries to several demonstrators but did not give a figure. About 5,000 demonstrators rallied to urge the government to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return to attend the funeral of his mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, who died May 4. A breakaway group of 2,000 demonstrators, chanting `` If you want trouble, we will give you trouble!'' later marched toward the embassy and were blocked near City Hall by 50 policemen. A police spokesman said the demonstrators were dispersed when they started throwing stones at the officers, who fought back with truncheons and later used tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse the marchers. The marchers later regrouped in the central Bonifacio Square to protest the dispersal.

<TEXT>
 A senior government minister told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> today that Indian troops battling Tamil rebels in the north and east will withdraw from the island nation. `` The government is very keen to see the Indian peacekeeping troops leave. They are definitely going,'' said <PERSON> Gamini </PERSON> <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON>, land and river development minister. <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON> said the withdrawal would be in stages but that the date of the pullout has not been discussed yet. He did not elaborate. Indian Defense Minister K.C. Pant is scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> this week to discuss peace proposals with Tamil militants, who have been fighting for a separate homeland since 1983. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> signed a peace accord in July 29, 1987 to end the Tamil separatist war in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s northern and eastern provinces. The accord, which grants some autonomy to the minority Tamils in exchange for a surrender of weapons, has been rejected by the militants. Indian troops landed on July 30, 1987 to disarm the militants and enforce the peace pact, and an estimated 50,000 Indian soldiers are now in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, a regional power, became involved because of its own 60 million ethnic Tamils, who are politically powerful and have close ties with the Sri Lankan Tamils. A senior police official, meanwhile, reported that Sinhalese extremists killed a candidate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the central <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION> district on Wednesday night. The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the victim as <PERSON> Jayaratna </PERSON> <PERSON> Heenbanda </PERSON>, who was going to run for the provincial council elections. A 19-year-old student, <PERSON> Aruna </PERSON> <PERSON> Saman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON>, also was killed Wednesday when gunmen shot at another government party candidate, <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayakody </PERSON>, at <LOCATION> Horona </LOCATION> town, just south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Sinhalese extremists also oppose the accord on grounds that it gives too many concessions to the Tamils. They have vowed to kill government officials, politicians and others who support the peace pact. Tamils are 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, most of whom are Sinhalese. Tamils say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who control the government and the military.

<HEAD>Judge To Hear Arguments For Retrying Sharpeville Six</HEAD>

trial. Pick up 6th graf pvs: `President P.W...' TRIMS thereafter.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge will hear defense arguments next month that the `` Sharpeville Six'' defendants should be spared death for complicity in the mob killing of a black official, court officers said. The black defendants _ five men and a woman _ were scheduled to hang March 18 for their role in the 1984 mob slaying of a black town councilor in <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. However, a stay of execution was granted March 17 in the case, which has attracted international attention and widespread appeals for clemency. <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> W.J. Human this week gave permission to defense lawyers to present arguments June 6 on why the trial should be reopened. The lawyers say they have evidence that a key state witness was coerced into giving false testimony. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that no decision had been made on whether to reopen the trial. It noted that government prosecutors would be arguing against the application to try the defendants again. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has said he will not intervene in the case. The trial caused debate in part because the six were not convicted of contributing physically to the death of councilor <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON>. Instead, they were convicted under the doctrine of common purpose, which held them responsible because they actively joined the mob. The killing occurred during riots provoked by a rent increase in <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> and neighboring townships. Also Wednesday, police said a former mental patient on Tuesday night killed two officers, including one accused by black squatters of organizing vigilante gangs against them. The 30-year-old white man who killed the officers in a shootout was identified as <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Plooy </PERSON>. He later was killed by police who stormed his house in <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoek </ORGANIZATION>, a coastal town on the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. One of the slain police officers, Warrant Officer <PERSON> Hendrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, was a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> policeman for 20 years. The white officer usually worked in impoverished black townships and squatter camps east of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. Last year, he was injured in a hand grenade attack in one township. Many blacks said <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> was connected with attacks and factional fighting aimed at intimidating or displacing squatters. <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> has been mentioned frequently in an ongoing court action filed by squatters who were burned out of their shacks in 1986. The plaintiffs said that <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> and other officers either encouraged or condoned an onslaught on the squatter camp by black vigilantes. Some witnesses have testified they saw <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> in a van leading a force of 1,000 vigilantes, and others say they saw him distributing incendiary devices. Scores of people were killed and more than 70,000 burned out of their homes during attacks on the squatters in May and June 1986. <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> said police tried to stop the violence but were unable to move through the densely packed shanties in vehicles and considered it too dangerous to go on foot. Some squatters have banded together to resist attempts to relocate them, and the government considers other squatter communities strongholds of anti-apartheid militants. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
 A Soviet media official today confirmed that 12,000 to 15,000 Soviet soldiers died in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> during the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s more than eight years of military involvement in that country's civil war. <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosental </PERSON>, a political observer for the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed a recent report by the Paris-based Agence France-Presse news service that 12,000 to 15,000 Soviets had been killed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rosental </PERSON>'s comment during a news conference to discuss <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s history was believed to be the first time a Soviet official has approximated the death toll from the Soviet intervention. He had been asked by a reporter how many soldiers had died in the war. He reviewed various Western media assessments, including the AFP report, and said: `` I think the figures cited by Agence France-Presse are more or less correct, but you can obtain more correct figures from our military men.'' <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, has promised to bring high-ranking military officials to a news conference soon to discuss the war's costs in more detail, <PERSON> Rosental </PERSON> said. A Soviet-inspired revolution in April 1978 brought a Marxist leadership to power in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Kremlin sent troops and tanks in December 1979 to help the allied <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government fight U.S.-backed Moslem rebels. Under a U.N.-mediated accord signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on April 14, the Soviets began pulling out their 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Sunday and are expected to complete the withdrawal within nine months. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said after the signing ceremonies in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that his government would release casualty figures once the pullout began. No date for the Gerasimov military press conference has been announced yet. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report released in December estimated the total number of Soviet casualties in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since 1979 at `` at least 33,000 to 38,000, more than one-third of whom were killed.' That would make the number of men killed in combat between 11,000 and 12,700, or more. `` Those estimates do not include heavy losses to disease,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report added. The report said disease is `` rampant'' among the Soviet troops, particularly dysentery and hepatitis caused by poor hygiene. If the death figures mentioned by <PERSON> Rosental </PERSON> are correct, then the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> suffered far fewer losses in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did in the Vietnam War. A total of 47,253 Americans were killed or mortally wounded in combat in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and adjacent military theaters of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and more than 150,000 were wounded. <PERSON> Rosental </PERSON> rejected a reporter's suggestion that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> was abandoning an allied government still beleaguered by a nationwide insurgency. `` To withdraw troops does not mean to leave the country in the lurch,'' the Novosti official said. `` We leave many cultural and economic facilities there. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is not abandoning anyone.'' The first Soviet soldiers to be withdrawn under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords, about 1,300 men from a motorized rifle unit, crossed the border at <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION> in the Soviet Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> on Wednesday.

<BYLINE>Dry, Cool Weather Gives Illinois Bell A Boost In Restoring Service

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A spell of cool, dry weather has helped <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> restore telephone service to thousands of customers in six suburbs west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> whose phones went dead after a fire ravaged a switching center, a company spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> has advanced its target date from mid-June to early June for restoring normal service to the 35,000 customers who lost all service after the May 8 fire, spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cose </PERSON> said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> expects to start connecting subscribers to a new digital call switching system being installed at its <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> center by May 26, instead of the original June 1 target date, <PERSON> Cose </PERSON> said. It normally takes 50 weeks to install such equipment under phone company guidelines. `` The weather has been our friend the last couple of days,'' <PERSON> Cose </PERSON> said. `` As long as it stays dry and cool, it's great for us; if it was wet and humid out there we'd probably be seeing more problems than we are seeing now.'' <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>'s weather _ with daytime temperatures in the 60s and nights in the 40s under clear skies _ has been good for the 250 employees working 24 hours a day to repair or replace old equipment and install the new switching system. The cool, dry weather has reduced problems with corrosion of old switching equipment badly damaged in the fire. As a result, <PERSON> Cose </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> officials are using the old equipment to restore partial service to customers until the new system is installed. Twenty dehumidifiers also have been set up to prevent corrosion of the old equipment. By Thursday, the company had restored partial service to 31,000 of the 35,000 customers whose service was cut off by the fire, <PERSON> Cose </PERSON> said. By the end of the week, all 35,000 subscribers in the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> area should have limited service, with irregular dial tones and crackling on the lines, <PERSON> Cose </PERSON> said. The technical problems will continue until the customers are hooked up to the new switching equipment, he said. As partial service is restored, many would-be callers have encountered delays because of heavy demand. `` It's like a jam getting on the expressway during the rush hour,'' <PERSON> Cose </PERSON> said. `` But the situation is better than it was yesterday.'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> expects that regional and long distance lines and special business lines transmitting computer data that were routed through the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> center should be functioning normally by the end of the week, <PERSON> Cose </PERSON> said. More than 125 coin-operated telephones were set up around the western suburbs, the company said. Many businesses that rely on telephone orders have been suffering from lagging sales, and one hospital started using pizza trucks to make birth announcements. Meanwhile, volunteer workers continued to staff mobile emergency reporting patrols in the six suburbs to relay calls for police, fire or medical services. <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> Village Manager <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruskey </PERSON> said 19 emergency vehicles would be on the street until the town was sure all local phones were operating. A <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION> company, <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, filed a lawsuit seeking class-action status and unspecified damages in <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Page </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for what it said was <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>'s failure to protect properly against the fire. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Janney </PERSON>, vice president and general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, said the company will give double credit to customers who have been without service. Bell has said it believes it is protected from legal damages under state law. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, said it might take months to determine the financial losses caused by the phone outage.

 Authorities said today that two men killed in a car bomb explosion were planning to park the automobile near the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but the explosives apparently went off prematurely. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman identified the men killed in the explosion Wednesday as <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Mousa </PERSON>, 23. Both were Kuwaitis. `` They were killed as a punishment for their intended crimes,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity under ministry rules. `` They wanted to plant the explosive somewhere in the area.'' He did not say what detonated the bomb on a main downtown avenue. The explosion, about 25 yards from the airline's office, destroyed the car and killled both men. No other casualties or damage were reported. Shops in the area were closed because Wednesday was the third day of the Moslem feast of Id el Fitr, which marks the end of the holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. There would have been few pedestrians in the area at the time of the blast, residents said. Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they believe that the driver wanted to park the Mazda-929 in front of the airline's headquarters.

 The man who built <ORGANIZATION> Sasson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jeans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> into a multimillion-dollar business before winding up in bankruptcy court has been charged with threatening the judge who is hearing the firm's bankruptcy reorganization case. `` I did not threaten anybody. I am astonished to see I have been accused of this,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Guez </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> during a hearing Wednesday in which prosecutors sought to have him detained without bail. <PERSON> Guez </PERSON> had been arrested and charged with threatening the life of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>. <PERSON> Guez </PERSON> claimed the charges were `` part of a conspiracy'' to block his attendance at an afternoon hearing on <PERSON> Sasson </PERSON>'s Chapter 11 reorganization plan. The magistrate ordered <PERSON> Guez </PERSON>, who was dressed in a rumpled gray suit and white shirt without a tie, held overnight. According to federal prosecutors, <PERSON> Guez </PERSON>, 43, threatened to kill <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> and the trustee he appointed to oversee <PERSON> Sasson </PERSON>'s reorganization `` if a result contrary to his interest were to be reached. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested <PERSON> Guez </PERSON> on Wednesday afternoon at the lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> building that houses bankruptcy court. The allegations of threats on <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> were based on information supplied by an informant described as a lawyer with `` a privileged professional relationship'' with <PERSON> Guez </PERSON>. The complaint further stated that `` due to the tone and demeanor'' of <PERSON> Guez </PERSON>, the informant believed he was `` fully capable of carrying out his threat.'' <PERSON> Sasson </PERSON> has been in bankruptcy proceedings since October 1986. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> approved the sale of the company's name for $ 8 million to <ORGANIZATION> Stanwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The Tunisian-born <PERSON> Guez </PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1976 with $ 74 and a new style of French cut jeans. Through clever advertising he made millions, also licensing the Sasson label for watches, lingerie and luggage. But the company, beset by to internal feuds, was swamped by lawsuits leading to the Chapter 11 reorganization.

 Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> have moved south and are within 45 miles of the border with <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported today.

 Investigators today blamed recent bombings in the northern Alto Adige region on neo-Nazi groups based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` The bombs were probably placed by German-speaking extremists inspired by neo-Nazi groups based in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> and the north <LOCATION> Tyrol </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> Compagnone </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> Bolzano </LOCATION>'s squad that handles politically linked crimes. He did not say what information led him to that conclusion. Alto Adige, also known as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrol </LOCATION>, borders <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and has many German-speaking residents. North Tyrol refers to an Austrian region along the border. In the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Bolzano </LOCATION> on Tuesday, bombs went off outside two buildings housing Italian-speaking families and outside the local offices of the Italian state-run television RAI and the Italian telephone company SIP. There were no injuries. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, the local state prosecutor, was quoted by <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> as saying the explosions `` may signal the beginning of a terrorist escalation in the region.

<TEXT>
 Japanese workers at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bases are protesting a policy that requires employees who deal with confidential matters to submit to lie detector tests. `` The plan neglects our basic human rights,'' said <PERSON> Misao </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamiyama </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 1,200 workers at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. The union Monday asked the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which hires Japanese workers for the bases, to urge the Americans to drop the polygraph requirement. `` In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, only criminals get that kind of treatment ... We are planning a full-scale nationwide protest against the decision'' if the agency does not respond by Friday, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> briefed the workers on the tests in April. <PERSON> Kamiyama </PERSON> said about 500 Japanese at were asked to sign an agreement to take a polygraph examination and were `` threatened to be transfered to other sections if they refuse to sign,'' he said. The accuracy of polygraph tests is widely disputed. An agency spokesman said it consented to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan but expressed concern about the `` human rights standpoint'' of polygraph tests. The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not elaborate. The agency acts as liaison between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Japanese government. Under the plan, only employees at <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plants would have to take the tests. Since September 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has been requiring the polygraph examination before it grants `` limited access authorization,'' to personnel, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman said. `` This is a measure taken worldwide and not aimed at Japanese alone,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. About 500 Japanese base workers are subject to the lie detector test, the spokesman said. Most work at ship repair facilities in <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sasebo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kamiyama </PERSON> said trasfers of employees who refused to take the tests could fuel anti-American sentiment among the Japanese. `` In <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, where people feel uneasy about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases occupying such a vast land, such an insensitive policy could easily cause a major protest, not only among base workers but also other people,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases occupy about 11 percent of the island of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>'s 867 square miles

 Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> said today he advises <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders not to be afraid to take risks for the sake of progress, and he cited recent price increases as an example. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> made the comment during a two-hour meeting with <PERSON> O </PERSON> <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> <PERSON> U </PERSON>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s Minister of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, who led a military delegation on a five-day visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The delegation returns to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> Friday. The 83-year-old senior leader went into semi-retirement last fall and has made rare public appearances. The nationally televised evening news showed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, looking fit and alert, greeting O with a hug and kisses on both cheeks. `` I often tell my colleagues to be brave and not be afraid of risks, because otherwise, no progress will be made,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>. He made the statement while talking about drastic price reforms that have raised the prices of four staple foods by as much as 60 percent. The price increases went into effect in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> four days ago, raising the prices of eggs, pork, vegetables and sugar by 28 percent to 60 percent. They created much grumbling among consumers already unhappy about skyrocketing prices. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s current price reform is a bold yet risky action, but the country's leadership is confident of doing a good job,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said. He said the price increases are necessary because food prices in the past were kept artificially low through government subsidies. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said reform of the price of raw materials would follow the rise in food prices. Resolving the price problem is imperative to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic progress and its attainment of the goal of reaching `` developed-country status'' by the middle of the next century, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as saying. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leadership knows every step the country takes involves risks and it could encounter difficulties,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said. `` The party and the masses have to understand this is a demanding task.''

<HEAD>Crew of Two Planned for First Soviet Shuttle Flight</HEAD>

 A Soviet space official said today two cosmonauts probably will man the nation's first shuttle flight. The Soviets earlier had indicated the inaugural flight of the space shuttle might be unmanned. No date has been announced. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> quoted <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatalov </PERSON>, head of the Soviet cosmonaut training program, as telling reporters visiting the space center in Baikonur that two cosmonauts would be aboard. `` The test flight will be carried out after all the systems of the Energia booster rocket and of the shuttle have been thoroughly checked,'' the broadcast quoted <PERSON> Shatalov </PERSON> as saying. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said the Soviet shuttle is `` similar to the American model, but has a number of design peculiarities.'' No other details were provided. Sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> familiar with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> space program say the shuttle has been tested at Baikonur on a 15,000-foot landing strip and that cosmonaut <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Volk </PERSON> is the program's chief pilot and likely to be part of the crew. Soviet officials have been saying since January that the first launch of a reuseable spacecraft was imminent and have varied in their reports about whether it would be manned or not. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaev </PERSON>, head of the Soviet space agency Glavkosmos, told a news conference in March that scientists were working around the clock to prepare for the first shuttle flight, which he said would be unmanned. `` We pursue the fundamental objective: whether man is alive or dead after the flight,'' <PERSON> Dunaev </PERSON> said, in pointed reference to the January 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle disaster in which seven astronauts were killed. The American shuttle program has been grounded since the Challenger tragedy. The first Soviet satellite launch for a paying customer was made on March 17, when an Indian satellite was lifted into orbit from the Baikonur spaceport in the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. Western sources have told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the Soviet shuttle will not have rocket engines mounted on it, as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle does. Instead, the engines are mounted on the <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION> booster rocket, and the reuseable craft is powered by jet engines which give it more maneuverability on landing.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has begun installing driver's - side air bags as standard equipment on three of its models and will add them this week to three more, becoming the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker to make air bags Federal safety regulations require increased use of passive restraints, such as air bags, which inflate in event of a collision, or automatic seat belts. Twenty-five percent of 1988 vehicles must have them, 40 percent in 1989 and 100 percent by 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it began installing driver's - side air bags on <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daytona </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> LeBaron coupe and LeBaron convertible models after Beginning Saturday, its large rear-wheel-drive sedans _ <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Fifth Avenue, Dodge Diplomat and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fury </ORGANIZATION> _ will have them. However, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> plans to stop building those three cars at year's end.

 Three military officers pleaded innocent today to charges of supporting an August 1987 coup attempt that left 53 people dead and hundreds wounded. Also today, the military reported that seven people were killed in communist guerrilla attacks. Army Maj. <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Doromal </PERSON>, Lt. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON> and Lt. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Catapang </PERSON> denied charges that they had incited <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> cadets to support the Aug. 28 coup bid against President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> meanwhile ordered a military tribunal to stop the arraignment of two other officers, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapunan </PERSON> and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Eslao </PERSON>. They have been charged with the same offense, but on Wednesday asked the court in a petition halt the arraignment and release them. The five officers were accused of voluntarily joining the mutiny led by former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> and denouncing the Aquino government in a letter read over a radio station in <LOCATION> Baguio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where the military academy is located. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> is still at large. In their petition, <PERSON> Kapunan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eslao </PERSON> accused chief of staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> and other officers of `` grave abuse of authority'' in filing the case against them. The court gave military authorities 10 days to answer the charge. A regional <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> commander said today that vice mayor <PERSON> Aquilino </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantiaga </PERSON> was ambushed Monday in the coastal town of <LOCATION> Albuera </LOCATION>, 360 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The top elective body in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> said soldiers entered a village and massacred about 100 peasants in retaliation for a rebel ambush of an army convoy. The military, in a communique issued late Wednesday, called the charges unfounded and said they were aimed at blocking efforts to capture the Maoist Shining Path rebels. In <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, lawmakers said the government would investigate. The alleged massacre reportedly occurred just hours before Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> during a four-nation South American tour. He did not travel to <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, which is 230 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The leftist-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Ayacucho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Provincial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said troops swarmed into <LOCATION> Cayara </LOCATION>, 50 miles south of this provincial capital, on Saturday and slaughtered the peasants. Cayara residents told council members soldiers `` indiscriminately'' killed 30 to 50 defenseless young men who were harvested corn in fields surrounding the town of 1,000 people, the council said in a statement Wednesday. Residents said troops then herded 50 more peasants into a chapel and killed them, the statement claimed. It said townspeople told the council they were unsure how many people were killed because the attackers poured gasoline on and burned some bodies and because many people had gone into hiding. It said the troops used bayonets to kill many of them. The council is headed by <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Fermin </PERSON> <PERSON> Azparrent </PERSON>, a member of the Marxist opposition party the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON> said the government of President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> would investigate. Leftist and human rights groups have frequently accused the military in the past few years of killing civilians in areas where rebel activity is intense and soldiers suspect villagers of sympathizing with the insurgents. The <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> military command said on Wednesday that 100 guerrillas of the Shining Path movement ambushed two army trucks around midnight on Friday near <LOCATION> Cayara </LOCATION>. It said four soldiers and six guerrillas were killed and 15 troops wounded in the fighting. Wednesday's communique, the first official description of the attack, said troop reinforcements pursued the guerrillas and the two sides clashed again on Saturday, causing `` unverified casualties among the subversives.'' The military communique said <PERSON> Cayara </PERSON> residents had fled and the town was empty when troops arrived on Saturday. It said four bodies were found in the chapel. <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>'s impoverished highlands were the birthplace and remain the stronghold of the Shining Path. The eight-year insurgency has cost more than 10,000 lives, mainly those of peasants caught up in the violence between guerrillas and government forces. Police in the provincial capital say the Shining Path has murdered hundreds of villagers in the province, more than 100 so far this year, who it accuses of supporting the army. The province had been under direct military control since late 1982. Residents of the province have linked the military with the deaths of nearly 150 peasants in three earlier purported massacres since <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> took office in July 1985. Charges by human rights groups that the military has waged a `` dirty war'' against peasants have eased, however, during <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s term

<HEAD>Youth Organization Asks For Explanation of Rumored Coup Plot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Slovenian youth organization says the military planned a coup in the republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> but that the government prevented it. The allegation and a demand for an explanation came in an open letter to <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> and its interior minister, <PERSON> Tomaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ertl </PERSON>. It was published by the magazine <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON>, official mouthpiece of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION>. In the letter, the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> alleged the coup was planned for earlier this year and included the arrests of nonconformist journalists, writers and officials. It said its report was based on widely spread rumors. The military was to quell street demonstrations and other unrest that were expected to follow the arrests, <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON> said in its current edition. The report said that according to rumors, the army had failed to notify the country's and <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s civilian Communist leadership of the coup plans. Slovenian security organizations notified <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolanc </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s member in the collective presidency and now <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s vice president, who prevented the plan, said the magazine. From <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> and Ertl `` we demand a clear and detailed answer to a simple question: How much truth is there in the above summarized rumors?'' said <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> Zavrl, an editor of the magazine, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> promised to reply. A number of articles published in the Slovenian press this year, particularly in <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON>, denounced the army as an undemocratic pro-Soviet institution intent on staging a military coup. In April, a parliamentary commission responsible for state security said the articles were part of an international conspiracy to weaken national defense and to overthrow the government. The army has criticized <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s leadership for not taking tough action against dissent in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. The dissent includes frequent attacks on Yugoslav domestic and foreign policies and such figures as the late <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON> published what it said was a speech by <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> at a closed session of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s Communist presidium on March 29 in which he said that the coup plan existed. The article quoting <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON>'s speech was immediately banned by the authorities under the pretext that it revealed a state secret, said <PERSON> Zavrl </PERSON>. Communists in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> have often been at odds with official <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> policy by offering unorthodox solutions to the country's deepening economic and social problems The proposals include introduction of a more market-oriented economy and closer ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is officially non-aligned.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said today that the government watchdog group <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> was wrongly accusing him of unethical behavior and that his actions were `` clearly legal and proper.'' Common Cause president <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> announced on Wednesday that his group, which monitors and suggests ways of enforcing ethical practices by public officials, was requesting an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee into whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated conflict-of-interest rules. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, for months has been the subject of published reports about his activities on behalf of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> associates and campaign contributors. According to the reports, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> receives 55 percent of the royalties, far above the normal 10 to 15 percent, for his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' The book, published by longtime campaign supporter <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, has earned <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> more than $ 54,000. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s firms reportedly received more than $ 250,000 for campaign services during 1985 and 1986 from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s re-election committee. <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> said the ethics committee needs to examine whether the speaker's campaign committees were at all involved in either publishing or selling the book, which he said could be a violation of House or other federal conflict-of-interest rules. The committee also needs to determine whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> improperly sought special treatment for constituents and party campaign contributors in connection with the regulatory activities of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, including blocking legislation, <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> said. `` Common Cause believes that it is in the best interests of the public, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and of Speaker <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee to examine and resolve these matters,'' <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> wrote in a letter to the ethics panel. `` We further believe that in conducting its inquiry, the committee should retain an outside counsel, as it has done on a number of occasions in the past,'' to `` ensure that the results of the inquiry are credible to and accepted by the public.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said today his discussions with the banking officials were part of a congressman's job. `` This action is clearly legal and proper,'' he said. `` Most members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intercede regularly on behalf of constituents with the various regulatory agencies of government,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the rules of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> clearly authorize members to receive royalty payments for their books, and he said his campaign committee `` did not pay any amount for publishing the book, nor did it purchase any copies of the book.'' The speaker today criticized <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> for not contacting him directly about the accusations. On Wednesday, the speaker's office released a statement accusing Common Cause of being `` the handmaiden of a partisan political initiative.'' <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> said his request was not associated with the actions of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s opponents. But Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., who has led the criticism, said Common Cause was giving ideological balance to the criticism <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said in a statement Wednesday he was working with lawyers `` to develop formal charges along the lines <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> suggests.'' The ethics committee, officially called the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION>, has been criticized by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and others for apparent reluctance to investigate the speaker's activities <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he had no comment on the letter

<TEXT>
 Fruits, spices and grains entombed with the ancient Egyptian boy king <PERSON> Tutankhamun </PERSON> for his journey to the afterlife have been rediscovered after 56 years in a musty storeroom, a newspaper reported today. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said an archeological student discovered the boxes of food remains at the Royal Botanical Gardens. The newspaper said the remains have not been disturbed since they were sent to the gardens in 1932 by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who discovered <PERSON> Tutankhamun </PERSON>'s tomb in the Valleys of the <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, in 1922. The remains were to have been cataloged by retired botanist <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boodle </PERSON>, but were apparently forgotten after his death in the 1930s. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, director of the gardens at <LOCATION> Kew </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was quoted as saying the remains recently were identified by <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutundjian </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vartavan </PERSON>, a 23-year-old French student working on a master of science degree in ancient Egyptian plants at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> The Times said the college's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeology </ORGANIZATION> is trying to determine what species of plants are represented in the hoard, which includes sections of funeral wreaths and more than five pounds of seeds, fruits and spices placed in <PERSON> Tutankhamun </PERSON>'s tomb after his death more than 3,300 years ago. The Times said the species indentified so far include emmer wheat for making bread on the journey, barley for brewing beer and a considerable quantity of watermelon seeds to chew on. Also found were coriander, fenugreek, black cumin, sesame seeds, two kinds of juniper berries and grapes. The Times quoted <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> botanist <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON> as saying the collection also includes more than 20 species of weeds. `` They will help to tell us how the crops were irrigated, how they were harvested and how they were stored,'' <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The newspaper said officials at <LOCATION> Kew </LOCATION> are willing to return the specimens to the Egyptian government, but would like to put some on display. The Independent newspaper said <PERSON> Tutundjian </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vartavan </PERSON> came across the Tutankhamun remains while studying ancient Egyptian plant remains. The Times and The Independent said the find represents only a fraction of the food buried in the tomb. The rest is still in 116 original wicker baskets and several pottery jars in the <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Dokki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will talk about ending the Vietnamese military occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said today. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will talk earnestly to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and try its best to resolve the occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> said. He said he was told of the apparent switch in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s position by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> during an 1 -LCB- - hour meeting Wednesday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> There was no immediate response from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> declined to say when and where the talks would be held.

He had accompanied Prime Minister <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsulanonda </PERSON>, who remained in the Soviet capital.

Soviet officials previously have said they had no direct role to play in the situation. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has occupied <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since 1978, when it drove the bloody <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from power.

 Youths from rival housing projects should be able to meet peacefully on the basketball court, say school officials, but police are n't so sure that street warfare wo n't spill over into the contest. The Board of Education this week unanimously approved a request to hold a basketball match June 5 between students from <LOCATION> Pitney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> and the nearby Shore Park complex, both on the city's west side. A school official said he believed there would be no replay of the violence that marred a tournament last year. <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON>, coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION>, where the game would be held, said the game would be the `` first attempt to try and ameliorate ... any animosity that still exists between these two areas.'' `` It will be a friendly rivalry rather than the combative rivalry that a turf war brings,'' he said. But <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> called the idea `` ridiculous'' and said he doubted the event would be permitted. `` We discourage any gathering of these two groups because they hate each other,'' he said. `` Both areas have a lot of weapons.

We need to have the debate, have the vote, and move on. `` I feel a particular responsibility in this instance'' because there is a Republican in the White House and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> conservatives are the chief critics of the treaty, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` The burden is on the Republicans to move this along,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, noting that the only proposed amendments have been spelled out by members of his party. `` Maybe we could even get lucky and finish this by next Tuesday or Wednesday,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` I hope we continue to expedite this process.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves Wednesday for his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and he has said he hopes he take a ratified treaty with him. After the vote late Wednesday, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` I think the vote we've just had is an indication of the strong support we have for this treaty. Let's get on with it.'' Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., agreed with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> `` Let's do our work. Let's not fool around, which I think we are doing to a large extent on the amendment that was just defeated. ... I do n't know what benefit there is in waiting until after the summit begins to ratify this treaty.'' `` There is no cause for further, untimely delay,'' said <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt., said `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want the president to have a ratified treaty in his briefcase when he meets'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed Dec. 8 by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, calls for the elimination of all missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> contended that because <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was signing as the general secretary of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, he represented a political party and not the Soviet state. `` This document now at the desk is not binding on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It is only an agreement between the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the head of a foreign political party,'' said <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, agreed with <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, noting that `` if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is removed from power someday, they could easily come back and say he was only the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and therefore the treaty is invalid.'' But Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., responded that `` there is no substance whatsoever to the claim that the treaty was not legally signed ... Treaty making is a matter of common sense and wise judgment.'' Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said there was no question that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was representing his nation when he signed the pact. `` It is clear that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and no one else in that delegation was the chief representative of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> rejected what he said he were insinuations that he was raising technical points simply for the sake of delay. `` What is occurring is not dilatory, but is instead and, in fact, deliberative,'' he told his colleagues. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> still faces an unresolved fight over the legal interpretation of treaties. That dispute arises from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s claim that he has the legal right to unilaterally change how a treaty is viewed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He has asserted that right in relation to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. Democrats who control the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have added an amendment to the INF pact which says no future president can reinterpret the pact without <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval. Republicans object to the addition. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said Wednesday that the interpretation amendment was a `` booby trap'' that `` creates confusion and confrontation. He called it `` a turf battle extraordinaire in which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is seeking primacy in the treaty-making process.'' But Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md., disagreed, arguing that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should protect its rights `` If we do not do this, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s role in treaty-making will be completely obliterated,'' he said.

 The commander of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> said today that the missile attack on the USS Stark a year ago led to improved safety techniques that helped save a sister vessel. Rear Adm. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Less said the survival of the missile frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> after it hit an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> mine last month was `` proof positive that others live, due to the sacrifice of the brave men on Stark.'' Thirty-seven sailors were killed when two errant Iraqi missiles hit the Stark on May 17, 1987. Less, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, spoke of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s improved shipboard safety measures at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy ceremony honoring the sailors. Ten crewmen on the <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> were injured when it collided with a newly laid mine in the central gulf April 14. Its skipper, Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON>, has said lessons learned from the Stark incident enabled his crew to keep their ship from sinking. Less said the sacrifice of the Stark's crew `` greatly assisted the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in being smarter, more combat-ready, especially here in this gulf, and elsewhere throughout the world.'' Among post-Stark safety measures now in effect are procedures under which Iraqi warplanes raiding Iranian oil tankers are warned away from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> both have attacked neutral tankers in the gulf as part of their 7 -LCB- - year-old war The Iraqi government said the Stark attack was a mistake, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accepted its apology.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> today after a 12-day South American tour in which he condemned drugs in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, preached reconciliation in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and reminded <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> of its Roman Catholic roots. The pontiff's plane arrived at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ciampino </LOCATION> airport shortly after 4 p.m. and he headed directly for the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. He ended his tour in the Paraguayan capital of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> on Wednesday with a plea for listeners to settle their differences and build a better nation. The day also marked his 68th birthday. `` The key to unity, reconciliation and brotherhood is in the Scriptures,'' the pontiff said at an airport farewell ceremony attended by authoritarian President Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 75, the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s longest-ruling head of state. `` By building a Christian nation and being faithful to your genuine roots, you can build a <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> of tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who early in the visit preached respect for human rights and civil liberties to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, in power since a 1954 coup. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, bidding the pope goodbye, said the visit had been a `` source of joy and hope'' for <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, which he described as `` a pluralistic and democratic society ... without terrorism ... and enjoying full freedom within a state of law.'' Most outside observers regard the nation of 3.8 million people as a dictatorship. The <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Patria </ORGANIZATION>, run by the governing <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, lashed out on Wednesday at the pope's Tuesday night meeting with a church-selected group of civic and cultural leaders which included opposition activists. The church had called the group <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Labeling the group a `` grab-bag of society's destroyers'' <ORGANIZATION> Patria </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial: `` There is no doubt about the opposition's ideologizing, politicizing and manipulating everything concerned with the meeting. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s trip, his 37th since becoming pope in 1978 and the ninth to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, took him from tiny <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, high in the Andes, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and landlocked, semi-tropical <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. The pontiff ended his trip at a giant youth rally where he was serenaded with `` Happy Birthday'' sung in his native Polish and in <LOCATION> Guarani </LOCATION>, the Indian language spoken along with Spanish by most Paraguayans. `` I feel young, especially when I'm with young people,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told the youngsters, estimated at more than 100,000. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> urged them `` to love God above all things, to be saints.'' The rally ended a gruelling 57-hour schedule that included visits to five Paraguayan cities and meetings with <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, opponents who accuse the president of political repression, church leaders, poor peasants and landless native Indians. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> flew on Wednesday to the southeastern <LOCATION> Parana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> port of Encarnacion for a prayer meeting and visited <PERSON> Caacupe </PERSON> for a Mass at the national Catholic shrine. Speaking at a copper-roofed basilica dedicated to the Virgin of Caacupe, the pontiff repeated an earlier call that special attention be given to the rights of <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s peasants and Indians. Difficulties and problems `` are not lacking in the life of the native as well as that of the peasants,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. `` Often they have been marginalized and forgotten.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> added, strongly supports these groups `` and their demands that their legitimate rights be respected.'' The pope told tens of thousands of faithful at a prayer service in <LOCATION> Encarnacion </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> suffers from a concept of life that puts `` profits and a thirst for power above the human person and his needs.'' The Paraguayan visit was perhaps the most politically sensitive on the trip. Just after the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> arrived, police arrested four people associated with opposition activity, including a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jesuit priest, but later released them without comment. In <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most secular nation, the pontiff told the populace to remember its <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> roots and spoke out in favor of union rights. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most impoverished nation and a leading cocaine source, heard the pontiff call for a campaign against drug traffficking and corruption. In <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, amid massive security and the arrest of thousands of suspected troublemakers, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> urged an end to the `` hate and violence'' that have claimed 10,000 lives over a decade of leftist terrorist activity.

 A man who served time for killing his heiress mother-in-law and her nurse in 1977 has apparently committed suicide, authorities said. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, 54, slit both wrists and bled to death on his living room floor late Tuesday or early Wednesday, according to <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Coroner <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Musgrove </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> was convicted in the slayings of <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Congdon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> and her night nurse, <PERSON> Velma </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietila </PERSON>, 67, in <PERSON> Congdon </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION> mansion on June 27, 1977. <PERSON> Musgrove </PERSON> said <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> left three suicide notes.

<TEXT>
 Editorial writers abroad have begun looking ahead to a race in November between Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Here is some of what they had to say:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ The Guardian of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -LRB- liberal -RRB-: `` Something that has not happened since 1964 may suddenly, unpredictably, be happening again Almost 24 years ago, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> won <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the Democrats. No Democratic candidate since has performed that trick. ... And yet, this morning, we not only find Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 10 clear percentage points on nationwide polls, the front-runner in every major area of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>: we also find him 17 points ahead in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` May polls, of course, may be broken reeds in November. ... But, at the very least, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ought now to be sitting up and taking urgent notice. Our leaders, and those they pay to advise them on diplomatic developments, have until very recently ... tended to assume that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a foregone conclusion. That was always a little wonky. Today it looks stupid. Try President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for size.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ The <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- independent -RRB-: `` The American presidency has more often than not been held by dull men, or by men who would have been thought dull were it not for the interesting events in which they were caught up That is perhaps the explanation of the ` bore factor' which is affecting not just <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but his most likely Democratic opponent, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. This year's campaign is taking place in times of peace and prosperity for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> unmatched in most presidential election years this century. It is difficult for candidates to sound exciting in such times. ... `` Whoever wins, an envious world will eventually make sure that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> becomes _ for a while at least _ less peaceful, and perhaps less prosperous. That is the fate of great countries which are also democracies in a world in which most countries are neither great nor democratic. Either candidate will soon become more exciting than he is at present because _ sadly _ the events will become so. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should be grateful for these two ` bores' while she can.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ZIMBABWE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> -LRB- government-controlled -RRB-: `` In comparing Democrats and Republicans the former are more accessible and easier to communicate with American interests are interwoven with the interests of others. At worst the Democrats make Third World countries at least feel they are considered when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> makes decisions. But Republicans act in ways that fly in the face of accepted diplomatic norms. `` Because of that primary consideration for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests, it is highly unlikely that anyone with political ideas such as <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s would ever reach the White House. ... `` Mr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had no political program when he came in and may not quite understand the differences between the Contras and <ORGANIZATION> Unita </ORGANIZATION> but he went through on the ` make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the greatest again' ticket `` Yet the Democrats are the lesser of the two evils. Developing countries would certainly be better off with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. If he appointed a black to the post of secretary of state this would be for the purpose of internal public relations and not for any consideration of black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Developing countries must accept the fact that developed countries are only what they are because we are how we are. Any change in our status will proportinately change theirs. It is this that is drilled into the resident of the White House to always remember. `` We too in developing countries must always remember that.''

<HEAD>Senators Introduce Legislation to Overhaul War Powers Act</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bipartisan group of senators, aserting that the War Powers Act does n't work, introduced a measure today overhauling the 15-year-old law. `` There's an old saying that if something is n't broke, do n't fix it,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` Well, the War Powers Act is broken and it should be fixed.'' The Vietnam-era law, enacted over the veto of President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, restricts the power of a president to send <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel to situations of `` imminent hostilities.'' The current law requires a report from the president when such troops are dispatched. Under some circumstances, those troops must be withdrawn after 60 days or 90 days, unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> specifically votes to authorize them to remain. The new proposal would allow the troops to remain for an unspecified length of time unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> votes to remove them. In addition, the proposal creates a group of 18 senior congressional leaders who would regularly meet with the president to discuss national security matters. In situations of hostilities, the group of congressional leaders could trigger the war powers law by introducing a resolution to either authorize the troops to remain or to order them withdrawn. Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said the regular consultations between the congressional leaders and a president `` will forge a stronger basis for bipartisan cooperation in national security matters. `` Meaningful and consistant consultation with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would also help prevent the president from implementing a controversial policy that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could not responsibly change,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. All four presidents since the enactment of the war powers law have contended that it is an unconstitutional restriction on their authority. `` The War Powers Act, as presently constituted, is unworkable,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a co-sponsor of the proposed `` Frankly, if I were president, I would thumb my nose at this legislation,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, speaking of the existing law. `` No president can indicate to a potential enemy'' plans such as the length of a proposed deployment of troops, he said. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he supports the change because the existing law `` has never worked very well.'' `` Every president resents a diminution of his power,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, explaining why the law has always been a focus of legislative-executive fights. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had not been consulted in advance about the proposed change in the law. `` I would hope the administration wo n't veto this,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. He said hearings will be held later by the Foreign Relations Committee. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said, `` It will be up to the administration to look at this and see if they can support it.'' Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that `` the present law does not seem to be working.'' The latest fight over the War Powers Act involves <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> policy of reflagging 11 Kuwaiti-owned tankers and protecting them with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has refused to invoke the law, even though there have been four separate clashes between the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has debated trying to invoke the law, but has been unable to agree on whether that should be done.

 A truck driver in an 18-wheel rig rammed more than two dozen vehicles during a 40-mile freeway rampage, then told police he only hit people who `` would n't get out of my way,'' authorities said.

The driver, identified as <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Haltom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, refused police orders to stop and was taken into custody Wednesday after his brakes locked on the Hollywood Freeway, officials said. The driver was arrested for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon _ his truck, said <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Maas </PERSON>. He was also arrested for investigation of possessing narcotics, evading arrest, reckless driving and possessing a concealed, loaded weapon, <PERSON> Maas </PERSON> said. Authorities said tests indicated he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, a dispatcher with <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, Texas-based <ORGANIZATION> Lisa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has worked with the firm for about two years. The tractor-trailer rig was bound for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with a load of ironing boards. `` We are on top of the situation and have notified our insurance people. We do n't know anything more right now,'' said <PERSON> Wendal </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, the company's safety director. As of today at least 24 accident reports had been made, although authorities believe others may have occurred, <PERSON> Maas </PERSON> said. About a dozen <ORGANIZATION> CHP </ORGANIZATION> officers, a police helicopter and a canine unit chased <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> through afternoon rush-hour traffic. `` His method was to run up behind a car going 15 to 25 mph, faster than the intended victim and then accelerate,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiedmer </PERSON>, who saw the driver ram five cars. `` Those people who would get out of my way, I would n't hit. But if they would n't get out of my way, I would hit them,'' <ORGANIZATION> CHP </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> as saying after he was arrested. No one involved in the crashes was hospitalized, said <ORGANIZATION> CHP </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>. `` We had three people complain of pain,'' she said. `` He's been one of our very best drivers and is a very nice person, I have no explanation for what happened,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. On the rear of the truck was a sign that read, `` How am I doing? If you see this vehicle operated in an unsafe manner, call 1 -LRB- 800 -RRB- 441-3847,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towing </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. An 800 operator said the number did not work in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area.

<TEXT>
 Syrian and Iranian efforts to end a two-week battle between rival Shiite Moslem militias remained deadlocked today as fighting raged on in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where foreign hostages are believed held. Police said one man was killed and 10 people were wounded as the pro-Syrian Amal militia, bottled up in <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION>, its last stronghold in the southern slums, traded machine gun fire with the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Today's casualties brought the overall toll to 244 killed and 772 wounded since the fighting began May 6 in the 16-square-mile district. The man killed was a bystander who was checking on his damaged apartment, police said. A police spokesman said the fighting has `` settled into exchanges of machine-gun fire,'' as <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, tightens its grip on 90 percent of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The spokesman, who by regulation can not be identified, said most of those wounded today were civilians hit by rooftop <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> snipers. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on Sunday massed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks and armored vehicles on the southern, western and northern edges of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and its officers said the army was prepared to move in to quell the fighting. However, there was fear that such a move might endanger foreign hostages believed held in the slums. The independent <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> said, meanwhile, that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was opposed to such a deployment and wants the Syrians to send in only a limited `` disengagement force'' to separate the combatants. <PERSON> An-Nahar </PERSON> said the Iranians also want guarantees that the Syrian force would not seek to disarm <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s third demand, <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> reported, is that `` the issue of releasing the hostages be separated from the objectives of the Syrian deployment,'' the paper added without further elaboration. Most of the 18 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed held by Hezbollah-affiliated zealots based in the southern slums. Acting Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> said on Wednesday that the hostage issue will be `` solved'' once the fighting ends. `` The case of kidnapping -LRB- foreigners -RRB- in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is part of the crisis which <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is passing through. I believe that if we could end the state of war currently prevailing, then definitely the other case would be solved too,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> today, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, said he would talk with Syrian officials in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> to try to help secure the release of the nine American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The nine include the longest-held foreign hostage, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent. He was seized March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, who leaves Friday for the Syrian capital, would not detail his plans. He said the trip was prompted by a concern for the safety of the hostages because of the fighting in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, Brig. Gen, <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON>'s efforts to arrange a peaceful settlement were not succeeding. The two met for 90 minutes on Wednesday, after which <PERSON> Kenann </PERSON> said: `` We are giving political efforts a chance to solve the problem and end the bleeding in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.'' The Iranian embassy said <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> would meet later today with <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> to `` pursue his efforts.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally in the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. However, it recently has been alarmed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s efforts to dispute its role in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by trying to dominate the nation's 1.2 million Shiites through <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has been embroiled in civil war since 1975.

<NOTE>EDs: Top 6 grafs new with Fitzwater reax to Bush comments on
administration drug policy; editing thruout, no pickup</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman said today there is `` no conflict'' resulting from Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s implied criticism of administration policy on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` I'm saying that he has his ideas on how he's going to want to do things, and that's fine,'' said <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The spokesman spoke one day after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides suggested a break with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the question of dismissing drug-trafficking indictments against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't mention <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s name as he touted his own drug enforcement policies on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and he side-stepped reporters' questions on the subject. But an aide told a reporter, `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> just would n't make a deal with a guy like <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' At his daily news briefing, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was questioned about the White House view of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s apparent move to distance himself from some of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policies. `` We expect the vice president to be speaking out on how he would do things differently and what his opinions are,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` As we go through this campaign, I would expect to see the vice president speaking out on a number of issues in terms of what he would do,'' he said. `` I expect a number of them will be different than existing policies and we will not criticize them in any way. If you want to drive a wedge between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the vice president, forget it.'' In his speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Drug dealers are domestic terrorists, killing kids and cops and they should be treated as such. I wo n't bargain with terrorists and I wo n't bargain with drug dealers either, whether they are on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or foreign soil.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't expand on those phrases and repeatedly refused to comment on the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> situation directly. But in background discussions, aides said that if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were to become president, he would n't do what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is doing _ offering to drop drug indictments if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will yield his power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The vice president has never directly criticized the administration's dealings with the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s latest pronouncement wrapped up a weeklong Western campaign swing that had been dogged by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration controversies. Those problems are sticking to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he conceded Tuesday, helping drive down his ratings versus <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The Republican standard-bearer used this trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to lay out some differences _ if not dramatic ones _ with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. For example, he called Monday for action on acid rain, where the administration has for the last seven years called only for more study. The <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> situation is a particularly sticky one for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for it hurts him on an issue _ drugs _ that aides say he wants to use against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the fall. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said the speech is the first of a series by the vice president on drugs. Asked why polls show <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is perceived as tougher on drugs, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said: `` The voters will get a chance to decide who will be tougher on drugs. ... You can count on the vice president spending more time on the problem,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> added. In words and actions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> worked Wednesday to emphasize his commitment to fight drug abuse and his different approach from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s. The vice president began the day with a private meeting with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and then visited a storefront, raided by police earlier this month, where the potent cocaine derivative crack was sold and used. Asked about the practical value of his visit to the onetime crack den, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bristled a bit. `` It's not show business,'' he said. `` Anybody who has practical experience, you learn more from them. You try to learn and understand and then take action ... It's been extraordinarily helpful.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> efforts to curb drug abuse, but said he would do things differently. For one, he said he would make his vice president more than just the head of a task force on drug interdiction. `` If I'm elected, I will put my vice president in charge of every aspect of federal drug policy,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced. `` I will ask the vice president to head a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet-level </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> of war to pull the effort together ... to make sure it's carried out.'' He repeated his call for the death penalty for drug kingpins. `` I'll demand stronger penalities for drug offenders. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> criticize our anti-drug effort _ I readily concede there's room for improvement _ but I want them to join me on these tougher penalities. This is n't Democrat or Republican,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Panel Would Require Better Information on Home Equity Loans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously today to require banks and credit unions to provide more timely and complete information on home equity loans, or second mortgages. Under the bill, passed by voice vote, lenders would have to disclose prior to making a loan the annual interest percentage rate, any fees associated with the loan, a series of warnings about the risks involved and a description of repayment options. Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the committee's consumer affairs subcommittee, said, `` This legislation will provide consumers with important information regarding home equity lines of `` It will enable those consumers to understand fully the conditions of this new form of consumer borrowing,'' said <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>. `` It will make clear to them that they risk the loss of their home in the event of default.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement handed out in the committee room after the bill was approved, said: `` In recent months we have worked with legislators to ensure that the bill preserves the product by providing for creditors' remedies in deteriorating loan situations. `` However, the disclosure and advertising provisions are impractical. They will result in an unnecessary overload of information for consumers, and they will severely limit the creditors' ability to design informative advertisements,'' the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> said. The biggest difference in the measure approved today and the one which came out of the Annunzio subcommittee in February was a provision barring lenders from unilaterally changing terms of the loans, except in some instances. `` Traditionally, in open-end accounts, a lender has reserved the right to change the terms of the loan,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, chief sponsor. `` However, this provision causes special problems in the home equity area. The high initial fees, the fact that the home is at risk, and the large lines of credit involved, make this unilateral right to change the terms of the loan undesirable in the home equity area.'' A home equity loan disclosure bill has passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as part of a bigger bank restructuring bill now being considered by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. A committee staffer said proponents wanted a separate bill to pass the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and be sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in case the bank restructuring measure is not approved.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> environmental organization said today it had agreed to help the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> investigate and demonstrate energy conservation in homes and commercial buildings as a method of slowing the `` greenhouse'' warming of the earth. The agreement between the academy and the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> also calls for research help in minimizing the use in appliances of the chlorofluorocarbon refrigeration fluids, which as gases help destroy the earth's protective ozone layer. Those gases contribute to the expected warming of the earth, but the major source of that warming will be carbon dioxide formed by the combustion of fossil fuels. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> together probably account for almost half the world's emissions of carbon dioxide, the council said. Among other things, the agreement calls for construction of a building technology demonstration center in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, visits to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources of information, demonstration of retrofitting energy-saving devices such as insulating windows to residential buildings in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and drafting model building codes. The agreement was signed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last Friday by the council's executive director, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, and academy official <PERSON> Yevgheniy </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikov </PERSON> The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is believed to be one of the world's most energy-inefficient economies because most energy use is not regulated through a market. `` Many families still use open windows to regulate the temperature in their centrally heated apartments, even in the dead of the Soviet winter,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said in its 1988 `` State of the World'' volume. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> energy efficiency improved 23 percent from 1973 to 1985 and Japanese efficiency improved 31 percent, Soviet efficiency did not improve at all, <PERSON> Worldwatch </PERSON> said. The institute, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> environmental policy research and advocacy organization, has estimated that the Soviet economy uses about 45 megajoules -LRB- 12.5 kilowatt hours or almost 43,000 BTUs -RRB- per dollar of gross national product, 60 percent more than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy in 1985 and more than three times the comparable figure for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Natural Resources Defense Council, founded in 1972, is a private group based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that does research and advocacy on behalf of environmental causes. It is perhaps best known for its frequently successful litigation against government agencies. One survey two years ago by the magazine `` Environmental Forum'' concluded that it was the most effective of all the environmental groups that lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It has engaged in joint research with Soviet scientists on questions of verification of arms control agreements.

 The White House said today that the drug-smuggling indictments against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were not brought to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for advance approval but that it views the charges as `` a correct course.'' Even so, the administration is ignoring <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appeals and appears intent on offering to drop the indictments in return for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation as defense chief. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials monitored the process as the indictment against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was being considered earlier this year. `` It was n't brought to the president for decision,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` There was no questioning of it by the administration. We still think it's a correct course.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` It does n't do any good to go back and start second-guessing it now. We're standing by it, we're on a course and that's it.'' Asked to reconcile his assertion that the administration was sticking by its course with the reported offer to drop the charges, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Indictments are very important to putting the pressure on him, -LRB- it's -RRB- all part of the process.'' The State Department's No. 3 official, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, said Wednesday that the objective is to find a way to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from politics and withdrawing the indictments `` may represent one means'' of accomplishing that goal. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said that approach `` may be a worthwhile way of proceeding'' because <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be beyond the reach of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors so long as he remains in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He noted that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition treaty with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> does not provide for the extradition of Panamanian nationals. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 86-10 to approve a non-binding resolution expressing opposition to dropping the indictments. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> made his remarks during a trans-Atlantic interview with foreign reporters sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. His statement broke what had been a prolonged news blackout by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials on the nature of the discussions with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The first indications that dropping the indictments was being discussed with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> came last week from <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials speaking privately. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Wednesday he is `` reasonably hopeful'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will succeed in removing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power. `` The negotiations are under way,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Our policy is that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go, and indeed that remains our commitment.'' Referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he understands the frustration of his former colleagues. `` The fact remains that the administration has a firm, fixed policy that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go and we are working very hard to see that that happens,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` We're working very hard to see that that happens. I am reasonably hopeful that we'll get that result, but we do n't have it yet.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that administration officials are now trying to depict the initial <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decision to seek <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s indictment as poorly thought out. The newspaper, which did not identify the administration sources, reported that they also said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did not submit the decision to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> for their approval. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did consult with officials of the State and Defense departments, and with the White House National Security Council staff before the indictments were returned, one official told the Times. White House spokeswoman <PERSON> Leslye </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsht </PERSON> said Wednesday night she had no comment on the report. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked Wednesday whether a deal with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been completed, said `` I do n't know.'' Asked whether the two sides were close to an agreement, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave the same response. The negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> are being carried out by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who has spent much of this month in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The plan reportedly calls for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down as commander of the Panamanian defense forces in August and to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for at least one year.

<TEXT>
 Wall Street's underlying dread of another stock crash has been aggravated by two significant events, an upward spike in interest rates and the first notable selling by big institutional investors in several weeks. Unresponsive to good news and obsessed with the bad, the stock market took another sharp spill Wednesday, depressing the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to its lowest point in more than three months. Broader market indexes also fell sharply. Prices weakened further this morning. The Dow average was down 24.86 points to 1,926.23 by 11 a.m. EDT on Wall Street, and losing stocks outnumbered gainers by nearly 5-to-1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The declines themselves were not particularly new or alarming, because prices have been bouncing up and down for a while in a post-crash market dominated largely by brokers buying and selling to each other. What concerned investment professionals this time was an influx of sell orders from large institutional investors such as pension funds and mutual funds, the flesh and bones of the stockholding public. The selling suggested that these crucial investors are growing exasperated. `` Today's the first day I've seen some real institutional liquidations,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, head trader at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said as the selling intensified late Wednesday `` You're getting some acknowledgement from institutional investors that there's a problem.'' Institutional selling partly was responsible for inflating the volume on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where 209.42 million shares were traded. It was the first time the volume exceeded 200 million shares in more than a month. To the technical strategists who attempt to plot the stock market's course based on mathematical formulas and past behavior, the price drop signaled some serious concern as well. The Dow industrials fell 35.32 points to 1,951.09 on Wednesday, the lowest since Feb. 9, when it closed at 1,914.46. At one point, the average fell through 1,950, which strategists have called an important `` support level.'' In addition, a drop in the Dow transportation average, which often precedes declines in the industrial average, suggested prices would keep falling. More disturbing to some strategists was the lack of support levels on their technical charts, based on the market's movements since it plunged 508 points on Black Monday, Oct. 19, to 1,738.74. Between that level and the Dow average's position now, there have been only two stable points, 1,930 and 1,860. Stock strategists who look at economics to predict the market's behavior said rising concern about inflation and interest rates was a key reason for Wednesday's big selloff They were particularly alarmed by the bond market, where prices tumbled and yields on the 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond flirted with 9.3 percent, the highest point since the crash. This has made bonds increasingly attractive as an alternative investment to stocks. `` When the bond market started falling apart, we saw quite substantial blocks of institutional selling in the stock market,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a trading strategist at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's certainly bearish for the stock market, because institutions get out of the stock market when they can get risk-control yields elsewhere _ the bond market,'' he said. `` Why take risks in a stock market that in the past three or four months has been volatile, with not much volume to support it? The flight to quality bonds and risk-controlled investments is going to be the thing to do.''

 Federal judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> gave false trial testimony about draft letters and telephone calls in an attempt to hide his involvement in a bribery scheme, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeachment panel was told today. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> summarized the evidence used by a special judicial panel in concluding that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who was acquitted of bribery conspiracy charges in 1983, had actually committed the crime and tried to conceal his part in the scheme. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> sat silently with his lawyers in the hearing room as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on criminal justice heard <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> outline the judicial panel's case for impeaching the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> judge. <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> gave `` knowingly false'' trial testimony about phone calls and draft letters purportedly made in behalf of an old friend, <PERSON> Hemphill </PERSON> <PERSON> Pride </PERSON>, who was seeking reinstatement as a lawyer after serving a prison sentence in connection with misappropriation of housing funds. But <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> said the judicial panel's investigation concluded that the letters cited by <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> were intended `` to conceal his participation in the bribery scheme through false evidence.'' He said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' testimony about the phone calls also was `` knowingly false'' and intended to mislead the jury. It was the second day of testimony by <PERSON> Doar </PERSON>, a former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general for civil rights in the mid-1960s and special counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in its move to impeach President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in the Watergate scandal a decade later. The deliberate, soft-spoken <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> was selected by a special, five-judge panel of the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to lead its exhaustive, 3 -LCB- - year investigation of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' judicial <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted in 1983 of conspiring to solicit a $ 150,000 bribe from two convicted racketeers. But the judicial panel said it had found `` clear and convincing evidence'' that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> conspired with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Borders to solicit the bribe in exchange for a promise of lenient sentences. The panel also accused <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of trying to conceal the `` sale of justice'' by lying under oath and fabricating evidence at his highly publicized trial in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> five years ago. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who was nominated to life tenure on the federal bench by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1979, has consistently denied any wrongdoing. `` They found me not guilty of crimes I never committed,'' he said Wednesday at the start of impeachment hearings by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on criminal justice. `` I am not guilty, but I am not free,'' said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, the first black federal judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. His voice rising, he declared: `` I ask you in the name of decency, in the name of justice, in the name of the American jury system ... I ask you in the name of the American way of life, I beg you, I beseech you, I implore you _ hell no, I tell you and I demand of you that you set me free!'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., the subcommittee chairman, expressed concern that the case against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> might be racially and politically motivated _ as <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> has charged in the past But Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the panel, said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' race played no part whatsoever in the impeachment inquiry. Following <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> to the witness table, <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> reviewed the massive evidence used by the appeals court judges in their 381-page report charging <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> with impeachable misconduct. The report was endorsed unanimously by the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the chief policymaking body of the federal judiciary, which told <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders that `` consideration of impeachment may be warranted.'' <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> and subcommittee members listened to a series of secretly taped conversations and telephone calls in late 1981 between Boders and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent posing as racketeer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>. Borders was convicted at a separate trial in 1982 on charges of arranging the alleged bribe payment to <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. If the subcommittee recommends impeachment and the full <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> concurs, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> must vote whether to impeach <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. If impeached, he would face a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial on the charges. A two-thirds <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority would be required to convict <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and remove him from office. Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., whose district includes <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, entered the hearing room late Wednesday, shook hands with <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and took a front-row seat to listen to <PERSON> Doar </PERSON>'s testimony for about a half-hour

 After holding up a place where they peddle petals, an armed robber put the pedal to the metal in his getaway vehicle: a 65-passenger school bus.

 A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said today there are indications the Soviets will turn over facilities and equipment worth up to $ 1 billion to the Afghan government after <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops depart <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, undersecretary of state for political affairs, told reporters `` there have been indications that we have picked up'' that the Soviets intend to leave behind equipment and installations, `` perhaps a half billion or billion dollars worth.'' `` That does n't strike me as a demonstration of tremendous restraint,'' <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said, reiterating a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy that calls for continued supply of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid to the Afghan resistance forces as long as the Soviets continue giving aid to the Afghan government. `` We will have practical ways of accomplishing that purpose,'' <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deliveries. When the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed an agreement setting the stage for the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> rejected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal that both superpowers stop aiding their clients in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said, however, they still hoped the Soviets would change their minds as the withdrawal proceeded. It began several days ago and the first brigade of forces reached Soviet territory on Wednesday. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>'s comments indicated those hopes may have been dashed, at least according to the current indications. He noted that there have been reports of fighting between Soviet forces and the U.S.-backed mujahadeen. Asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> expected the Soviets to ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to urge restraint on the part of the resistance, to facilitate the withdrawal, <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said, `` the position we've taken on that has been generally, a prompt timetable is one that is more likely to elicit cooperation from the mujahadeen He advised the Soviets to make `` some kind of local arrangements'' with resistance leaders, through direct talks, to secure protection for the withdrawing Soviet troops. He said he had heard rumors of such arrangements in some areas.

 Singer-musician <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON>, paralyzed in an auto crash six years ago, said Thursday he is competitive at the top level of the music industry thanks to a versatile computer. `` I have come to realize that music and technology suddenly got married,'' <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on the handicapped. <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> said his MIDI _ musical instrument digital interface _ permits him to compose, arrange, create sounds and `` play literally every instrument that would be included in a 100-piece orchestra.'' `` That allows me to compete at the highest level.

<HEAD>Job Outlook Bright for Most Graduates with Agricultural Degrees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of new college graduates with agricultural degrees is down again this year, but <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say their job outlook is the brightest in a decade. One official warned Wednesday that the graduates are declining in number and that this could spell problems in critical food and agricultural specialities in the future. `` The demand comes in part from recent advances in agricultural science and technology, and from the need of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agribusiness to improve its position in international marketing,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the good news of greater job demand and record-high starting salaries, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and college officials said the nation's supply of graduates in agriculture majors continues to decline This year, for example, <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduated about 500 agriculture majors, down 35 to 40 from 1987, and <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduated 225, down from 301 a year ago. But salaries are looking up. At <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, starting salaries of graduates with bachelor's degrees in agriculture are averaging just over $ 20,000 a year. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> estimates starting salaries near $ 19,000 for those with bachelor's degrees, $ 24,000 for those with master's, and $ 34,000 to start for holders of doctoral degrees. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, reported situation is bright for all food science graduates, who will attract starting offers averaging $ 22,000 to $ 36,000. At <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M, agriculture graduates will average $ 17,000 to $ 26,000 to start. <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> says its graduates with bachelor of science degrees will see salary offers running 4 percent to 6 percent above last year's average of $ 20,406. Campus recruitment also has perked up, with many businesses finding a shortage of new graduates to fill current openings. The hottest spots in the job picture, according to college officials, include food science, poultry production, agricultural education, agricultural chemistry and engineering, dairy science, agricultural journalism, entomology, landscape architecture and ornamental horticulture. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> panel forecasts a `` continuing national shortage'' of 4,000 agriculture and life sciences graduates annually through 1990. Some experts predict the shortage will continue beyond that date and that it will become more significant as good starting salaries and career opportunities draw off bachelor of science graduates who otherwise might obtain master's or doctoral degrees `` To a degree, the laws of supply and demand will no doubt enter into play here, so that more college students, seeing that the agricultural professions offer good career opportunities, will choose an agricultural major,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. But he added that if college-bound young people fail to see the opportunities in agriculture, then `` the nation may soon face a critical shortage of expertise in the food and agricultural sciences and professions.''

 Farmers will get a smaller share of what consumers spend on food this year, according to a new <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. The food marketing bill, or the difference between consumer expenditures and the farm value of domestically produced food, is expected to increase 6.6 percent in 1988, compared with a 4.7 percent gain last year. Food marketing includes the costs of transporting, processing, packaging and merchandising food after it leaves the farm. `` While food expenditures will rise 4.8 percent _ about the same as the pace last year _ the farm value of food is expected to decline 1 percent, because of bigger supplies and lower prices for livestock and poultry products,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. During the first quarter, consumer food costs rose 3.1 percent above a year earlier, with much of the increase due to higher prices for fruit, vegetables and fish. Prices for food served in restaurants and fast-food outlets `` rose a little faster than prices for food at home,'' the report said. For all of 1988, food prices are forecast to rise 2 percent to 4 percent from 1987 when they increased 4.1 percent. The report continued to forecast 1988 net cash income of farmers at $ 50 billion to $ 55 billion, down from last year's record of $ 57 billion. Rising production costs and lower federal payments to farmers are factors in this year's decline.

 The state observed an official day of mourning today as grief-stricken friends and families gathered to bid farewell to six victims of one of the nation's worst bus crashes. The Rev. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Craycroft </PERSON> told mourners at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christopher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> that there were `` no real satisfying answers'' for the deaths of his three teen-age parishioners and other victims of Saturday night's accident, which claimed 27 lives. `` The saying is trite but painfully true: They had their whole lives before them,'' the priest said at the funeral Mass for <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, 14; <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Voglund </PERSON>, 13; and <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheelock </PERSON>, 14. They were to be buried at the same Radcliff cemetery where 12-year-old <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Earnest </PERSON> was laid to rest today in a brief graveside ceremony. All four girls were students at <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. A fifth middle school pupil, 14-year-old <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustain </PERSON>, was to be buried later today in <LOCATION> Tyler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, 14, of nearby <LOCATION> Vine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, a ninth-grader at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, was to be buried today at the same Radcliff cemetery as the others, which abuts his high school. Flags across <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> flew at half-staff to honor the memory of the 24 children and three adults killed when their bus was struck head-on by a pickup truck heading in the wrong direction on Interstate 71. `` If it were possible to turn back the clock, we would,'' Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said Wednesday in declaring today's official day of mourning. `` Whatever consolation we can give will never make up for the loss of friends and loved ones.'' A memorial service for all 27 victims was planned for tonight at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Radcliff </LOCATION>. Most of the other funerals were scheduled for Friday. Although fatal bus crashes also occurred this week in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, a deputy administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said today that school buses are remarkably safe. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` This Morning,'' said that the Saturday crash `` was no accident. This was a crash and this was caused by a drunk driver.'' `` Out of 46,000 fatalities on our highways every year, less than 100 even involve school buses,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` It's the safest form of transportation. We've got 350,000 school buses on our highways, they transport 21 million kids to school every day and they've done an extraordinarly good job.'' The <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> crash involved a converted school bus carrying members of a church group from an amusement park near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. Most of the victims were military dependents or had ties to nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION>. The service at the high school's 2,400-seat football stadium will include hymns and a performance by the post military band, said <PERSON> Lelia </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddle </PERSON>, secretary to Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutcherson </PERSON>. `` Right now, <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION> is kind of our mainstay,'' she said. `` They are being very involved because there are a lot of military families in this.'' The fort has also sent chaplains and counselors to help families. On Wednesday, grief counselors from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> conducted a seminar in <LOCATION> Radcliff </LOCATION> for school counselors, military personnel and others dealing with victims' families Also, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said it located a witness to the crash, and someone who saw what is believed to be the pickup truck cross the grassy median and head north in the southbound lanes. The truck driver, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, still hospitalized in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> about 35 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Radcliff </LOCATION>, was charged with 27 counts of murder, one for each of those who died in the accident. Authorities said he was intoxicated at the time of the crash. Thirteen other people remained hospitalized Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, four people remained hospitalized Wednesday from a public transit bus accident that killed a teen-age passenger. Police were checking reports that the bus accelerated after striking a car. Tuesday's accident started when a motorist tried to make a left turn in front of the bus. The bus struck the car and then lurched out of control, striking a tree, a pole and a fence before grazing a building and another pole, said Patrolman <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Cielec </PERSON>.

 At least 15 children became sick with an intestinal bacteria, and health officials suspect tainted snow cones. The children, ages 15 months to 12 years, were infected with the bacteria shigella and have symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever, said Dr. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> health director. The illnesses began May 9, she said. After talking with the children, health officials figured the culprit could be snow cones from delivery trucks that circle <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> neighborhoods. But Health Department personnel have been unable to find the trucks. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said no snow cone vendors have obtained the necessary permit to sell the cones. `` These are usually kitchen operations, and they sell the ice and sell the syrup to other people who in turn peddle it around,'' she said.

<HEAD>Child Schoolyard Preachers Suspended Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARION, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 6-year-old schoolyard preacher and his sister were suspended for a fourth time today for violating school rules. `` Now is the day of Salvation,'' 6-year-old <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> shouted at a crowd of reporters, schoolchildren and TV cameras as 5-year-old Pepper stood beside him holding a Bible. `` Hell has enlarged herself and opened her mouth without measure.'' The two children, returning today from their third suspension, arrived at <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in a car driven by their mother, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>. They stood at a teachers' entrance and waited for a cue from their 10-year-old brother, <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, who was outside the school gate. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> was suspended for 10 days last Friday for refusing to stop proselytizing and go to class. `` For God so loved the world ...,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> called from the gate, setting off a stream of preaching from his younger brother. `` Fools make a mock at sin,'' <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> shouted at Principal <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON>, who asked him to come inside the school. The boy stood his ground as <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> repeated his request several times. The children are not being suspended for their preaching, <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> said, but rather for remaining outside the school building when school rules require them to be inside. He said if the children would agree to come to school Friday and discontinue preaching, the suspension would be dropped. <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> complained that the children were being encouraged by publicity. `` If the news media was not here and if the offers for talk shows were not present, I believe in my mind they'd be back in school,'' he said. Pepper does not preach because she does n't want to, the children's father, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, has said. School officials call the preaching a disruption, while parents have complained that the fire-and-brimstone tone of the sermons is frightening other children. But the children's parents, who moved to <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> 17 months ago from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, call the suspensions an attack on their constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for proposing another in-depth look at the nation's drug problem, saying `` We do n't need another study. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement that he would n't bargain with drug dealers prompted a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman to say `` he has his ideas on how he's going ... to do things and that's fine. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a final appearance in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> before heading off to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, both states part of the June 7 primary season finale. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s will be the biggest primary of the season, offering 314 Democratic delegates, with 109 at stake in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke with community leaders in a neighborhood marred by drug use and violence. Asked about President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s announcement Wednesday of a new bipartisan study on drugs, he said, `` I do n't think we need another study.'' `` There is no Democratic or Republican or independent way to fight this,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrapped up a seven-day <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> campaign swing on Wednesday and made an anti-drug message his central theme. Campaigning in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he said that as president, he would n't `` bargain with drug dealers ... whether they are on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or foreign soil.'' Although he repeatedly refused to state his views directly on the administration's attempts to cut a deal with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment on drug charges, his aides said on background that the message was, `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> just would n't make a deal with a guy like <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' At the White House today, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was drawn into a debate with reporters over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s edging away from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy. `` I'm saying that he has his ideas on how he's going to want to do things, and that's fine,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` If you want to drive a wedge between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the vice president, forget it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' only remaining rival, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, suggested that racist comments by `` irresponsible public leaders'' helped create the climate for an alleged assassination plot against him. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was asked about this week's arrest of a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> couple accused of plotting to kill him. <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, were also charged with threatening an informant and possessing an automatic rifle. Papers filed in federal court indicated <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told an informer he was a member of The Order and other white supremacist groups, and that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should be killed. But lawyers for the couple said each denied belonging to a white supremacist group, and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said no evidence had been found that the pair belonged to The Order. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> initially downplayed word of the arrests, saying, `` I can not just focus on the two people arrested in St. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>.'' But later he told reporters: `` The climate for this kind of antagonism and violence, of course, has been set by many irresponsible public leaders -LRB- whose -RRB- attacks based on race have set a divisive and dangerous climate, such as the one ... in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in April, for example.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was apparently referring to comments by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> during the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary campaign last month. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, among other things, that Jews would be `` crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met privately Wednesday with nearly three dozen rabbis and Jewish leaders in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, in what he described as a `` step toward healing the wounds.'' Many Jews were offended by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1984 reference to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown'' and his association with <PERSON> Muslim </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> A dozen demonstrators outside the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> hotel where the session was being held chanted `` Lose, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, lose'' and `` Jew hater.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> again today. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the vice president stopped in at a storefront, raided by police earlier this month, where the potent cocaine derivative crack had been sold and used. Later, he visited the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and said he would convene a Cabinet-level `` council of war'' against illegal drugs. `` Together we can coordinate an attack on the drug trade that will be nothing less than a modern D-day,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The delegate race is over on the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> side _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mathematically clinched the nomination last month in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary. On the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> side, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has dramatically widened his delegate lead in recent weeks. By the latest <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> count, he has 1,643 to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 974. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign has written to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, complaining that under the delegate-selection process `` the vote of the people is distorted.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has long maintained that the support of so-called `` super delegates'' _ party and elective officials who have a vote at the convention _ should be roughly in line with the popular vote. But under party rules, the super delegates are not bound to follow primary results in their states. The letter to <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, signed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign chief <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s delegate to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, urged the party chairman to consider the `` moral and political questions'' raised by the rules. A copy of the letter, dated Tuesday, was sent to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, however, said he did not believe <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would mount a challenge to delegates at the Democratic convention. `` I do n't think we are going to have a fight with Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, who added a primary win in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> to his column this week, was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on Wednesday, where he met with local Democratic leaders, then mingled with patrons and served up beers at a restaurant in the waterfront city of <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Senate Proposal Would Modify Vietnam-Era Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The War Powers Act, a Vietnam-era law that has been the focus of a long-running fight between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, would be overhauled by a proposal introduced Thursday in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our goal is to make the statute more workable,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a sponsor of the reform Commenting about the existing act, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said, `` Frankly, if I were president, I would thumb my nose at this legislation. The War Powers Act has never really worked.'' The law was enacted in 1973, over the veto of President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who argued that it was an unconstitutional restriction on his authority. That is the same position taken by all three subsequent presidents. The law requires a report from the president when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are sent to situations of `` imminent hostilities.'' Under some circumstances, those troops must be withdrawn after 60 days or 90 days, unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> specifically votes to authorize them to remain. The new proposal would let the troops remain for an unspecified length of time unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> votes to remove them. It also creates a group of 18 senior congressional leaders who would regularly meet with the president to discuss national security matters. `` Presidents have not consulted adequately with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> prior to making decisions to involve the nation in a situation where hostilities are certain, imminent or probable,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, arguing that the new 18-member group would change that. The congressional leadership group could trigger the war powers law by introducing a resolution to either authorize the troops to remain or to order them withdrawn. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes the change is a good idea because the current law `` has never worked very well.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said he does n't know whether President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will back the change. `` It will be up to the administration to look at this and see if they can support it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, explaining that administration approval was not sought by the group of legislators who drafted the plan. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said, `` I would hope the administration wo n't veto this.'' He said action is likely later this year by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said that `` the War Powers Act is a good example of the limited ability of human beings to predict future events.'' `` It was written for the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, and has been difficult to apply to current situation of small, brief military clashes or terrorist situations. The most recent dispute over the War Powers Act involves <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> policy of reflagging 11 Kuwaiti-owned tankers and protecting them with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels have also been authorized to aid neutral merchant vesels which seek help. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has refused to invoke the law, even though there have been four separate clashes between the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has debated trying to invoke the law, but has been unable to agree on whether that should be done. Last year, 115 legislators went to federal court and filed suit, seeking an order directing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to invoke the law. But the suit was thrown out of court and the legislators are now appealing that ruling. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the law was `` well intentioned, but it has not worked. We have spent countless hours proposing, filibustering, and debating measures to invoke a law _ rather than assessing the wisdom of the policy that prompted the deployment of forces.'' Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` there's an old saying that if something is n't broke, do n't fix Well, the War Powers Act is broken and it should be fixed.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said the law `` encourages confrontation rather than consultation between the presidents and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. When forces are introduced, the debate in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is frequently on procedure rather than policy.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said many of the problems in the current law arise because `` every president resents a diminuation in his power.'' The law was approved in November 1973 despite the veto by <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 284-135 to override <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s veto while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote was 75-18. Backers of the law argued that it was needed because <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> policies were usurping the congressional right to declare war Since the law was enacted, presidents have formally submitted reports on a dozen occasions, although they have rarely cited the section of the law which triggers the 60-day time period for a congressional vote.

<HEAD>State Officials Strip License from Dentist Who Never Went to

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cura </PERSON> was, by many accounts, a gentle dentist. But he gave up his license three weeks ago, when officials learned he never went to dental school. <PERSON> Cura </PERSON>, 46, was trained in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> as a dental technician and easily passed <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s dental exam seven years ago, his lawyer, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Braxton </PERSON>, said. He treated more than 3,500 patients. `` He learned a lot of techniques in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Braxton </PERSON> said. `` He just watched, observed and started reading a lot of books.'' Doctors praised him as highly competent, and patients said he was generous and had a knack for putting them at ease and getting rid of pain. State licensing officials alleged that <PERSON> Cura </PERSON> forged transcripts indicating he had attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Havana </ORGANIZATION> 1958-63 and had received a doctor's degree in dental surgery. They said <PERSON> Cura </PERSON> actually was a high school student in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> from 1958-60. `` We were absolutely thunderstruck and flabbergasted,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Altamonte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> dentist who chairs the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dentistry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cura </PERSON> told state officials he plans to go dental school, but the board last month rejected his request for a license suspension until he graduated. State officials said Wednesday no decision has been made on criminal charges. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reguation </ORGANIZATION>, said he wished <PERSON> Cura </PERSON> would go to dental school because he did a good job. <PERSON> Cura </PERSON>'s undoing was person who wrote anonymously to the department, saying that on a visit to <PERSON> Cura </PERSON>'s office, he noticed no degrees on the walls and began to investigate. `` I am asking you for all the innocent people that put their lives in his hands on a daily basis and trust him wth surgery without even imagining that he has never had university studies and does not know what he is doing,'' the letter said. <PERSON> Cura </PERSON> could n't be reached, but <PERSON> Braxton </PERSON> said he was contrite. `` I'd say remorseful is a very good word,'' the lawyer said. `` He comitted a wrong, there's no question about it.''

 One of the world's most successful filmmakers and a legendary film company release a $ 55 million cinematic gamble on Friday with the opening of the medieval fantasy `` Willow.'' Both <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, whose `` Star Wars'' and `` Indiana Jones'' movies have grossed $ 1 billion, and <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>, which once was <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s greatest studio, need a hit The movie is directed by <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, who won acclaim with `` Splash'' and `` Cocoon.'' <ORGANIZATION> Lucasfilm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> has produced two expensive flops, `` Labyrinth'' and `` Howard the Duck.'' MGM, meanwhile, is struggling to regain momentum after several reorganizations. As a further complication, financier <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, who owns 82.4 percent of the parent <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> @ <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, is seeking a buyer for the company. A `` Willow'' hit would enhance the price. Despite some early negative reviews for the movie, which goes into 1,000 theaters nationwide Friday, <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> can be proud of their achievement. `` Willow'' is movie storytelling in the grand tradition. No, it is n't a landmark film such as the `` Star Wars'' trilogy _ the kind of achievement that happens once a decade. Much of `` Willow'' may seem familiar to audiences exposed to special effects movies of recent years or to animated classics from <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>. But `` Willow'' stands on its own merits as high adventure executed with superior imagination. Theater owner and reviewer screenings drew mixed responses. Daily Variety called the film `` a medieval mishmash'' but predicted `` kids will probably love it.'' Time magazine said: `` For now, -LRB- <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' -RRB- wonder wand is broken.'' Newsweek's headline was: `` The Raider of Lost Art.'' Facing blockbuster competition from `` Rambo III'' and `` Crocodile Dundee II'' on May 25, <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> prudently released `` Willow'' five days earlier. `` Willow'' centers on the efforts of a brave dwarf to save a baby from the clutches of an evil queen who fears the child will destroy her power. The hero, <PERSON> Willow </PERSON>, finds allies in an over-the-hill knight and a pair of mischievous `` brownies'' _ creatures 9 inches tall. There are no major stars in the film, which features <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilmer </PERSON> -LRB- `` Top Gun'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalley </PERSON> -LRB- `` Dance With a Stranger'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> -LRB- `` Upstairs, Downstairs'' -RRB- and 19-year-old <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> as <PERSON> Willow </PERSON>. The 3-foot-4 <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was discovered by <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> a few years ago and cast as an Ewok in `` Return of the Jedi.'' The producers count on a box-office success to help their massive merchandising campaign. More than 30 companies have been licensed to manufacture such items as `` Willow'' underwear, bed sheets, lunch boxes, meal promotion at <ORGANIZATION> Wendy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, coloring sets, toy action figures, computer and board games, magic tricks, records, tapes and compact discs. `` Willow'' resulted from a friendship between <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, who met 15 years ago when <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> directed `` American Grafitti,'' with <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> as one of the principal actors. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was just out of <ORGANIZATION> USC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, directing his first major film under the sponsorship of his friend, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> had been an actor from the age of 5, working mostly in TV series such as `` The Courtship of <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s Father,'' `` The <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> Show'' and `` Happy Days.'' They met again a few years ago. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> recalled their conversation in a recent interview: <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>: `` I'd like to do a fantasy.'' Howard: `` That's something I'd like to do.'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>: `` I've always wanted to do a story that centered on a little person.'' Howard: `` That's something I've always wanted to do, too. I've always been intrigued by the idea of taking a little person or the relationship of two little people and developing it so that 15 or 20 minutes into the picture you'd forget completely that the person was small. `` Willow'' was the result, with <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> creating the story, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolman </PERSON> writing the script and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> directing. Among the director's many chores was preserving believability in the happenings of another world. `` Fantasy works best when everyone involved in a project _ writer, producer, director and certainly the actors _ believe what they're doing and try to be as honest as possible,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` The actors really had to trust that it was OK to look at a talking animal and play a scene just as if that creature was an important character in your life. Gee, they all really committed to it. That's the only way you can make a movie like this one.'' Shooting locations for `` Willow'' ranged from the glacial mountains of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> to the craggy cliffs of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, with interiors at the <ORGANIZATION> Elstree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The cost of `` Willow'' has been reported from $ 35 million to $ 40 million, with $ 20 million for prints and advertising. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> declined to confirm the amount. `` This is an escapist movie, and I do n't want people thinking what it cost when a lot of soldiers charge down a mountain. When there's an amazing special effect, I do n't want them whipping out their pocket calculators and saying, ` By my estimate ...' `` I want them to say, ` Oh, wow! What's going to happen next?'''

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Bill Requiring Full Disclosure on Home Equity
Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday unanimously approved legislation requiring lenders to make full disclosure on home equity loans. The bill also is designed to put an end to the use of unfair contract provisions and misleading advertisements. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, said the measure `` contains the kind of disclosures that will enable a consumer to make a reasoned judgment with the full understanding of what lies down the road.'' The legislation, he said, assures that the consumer will not be surprised by unilateral changes in terms after the contract is in force. `` The legislation is a major protection against consumers being duped by misleading claims and falling into financial traps that could lead to loss of a home,'' <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> said. The bill requires banks and credit unions to disclose important information about the terms and conditions of the loan, such as the various repayment options, with the application and before fees are required. Current law allows lenders to withhold disclosures until the consumer is about to sign on the dotted line. Lenders also would be required to tell the consumer about all fees which may charged in connection with the loan and whether or not the terms disclosred are guaranteed to remain in effect for a specific period of time. The full committee amended the measure that came out of the consumer affairs subcommittee on Feb. 24 by making more stringent a provision prohibiting lenders from unilaterally changing the terms of the contract after it has been signed, except in narrow circumstances. The bill also limits lenders from calling in the loan before the due date, except in narrow circumstances, and requires lenders offering variable interest rate programs to use an index which is outside their control and is publicly available The consumer also is protected from misleading statements or half-truths in advertisements. If an ad tells of a super-low, short-term rate, it will also have to display, in equal prominence, what the normal rate would be. All ads will have disclose the hidden cost such as fees and points. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON>, representing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Lenders have insisted on one-sided contracts which allow them to change the terms at any time after the borrower has signed on the dotted line. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has corrected this inequity by prohibiting the lender from altering the terms after the contract has been signed by both parties.'' <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Meier </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` These loans can be land mines for some consumers. The House bill will give consumers the information they need to keep in a financial safety zone.'' Home equity loans _ a line of credit available to borrowers who provide their homes as collateral _ have grown quite popular in recent years, especially since the federal tax law that went into effect last year still makes the interest on them tax deductible in most cases. Consumer groups report that home equity lending doubled between 1986 and 1987 from $ 40 billion to $ 80 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has passed a less stringent measure as part of a bigger bank restructuring bill which is now before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. A committee aide said proponents wanted a separate bill in case the restructing bill gets bogged down. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the trade group had worked with legislators `` to ensure that the bill preserves the product by providing for creditors' remedies in deteriorating loan situations. `` However, the disclosure and advertising provisions are impractical,'' said the statement. `` They will result in an unnecessary overload of information for consumers, and they will severely limit the creditors' ability to design informative advertisements.''

<HEAD>Bush Must Define Himself Without Undermining Reagan</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a painfully slow ballet, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is delicately stepping away from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Each step is carefully choreographed as the cautious <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president tries to define what he would do as president _ without undermining or angering the president. The Republican nominee-to-be can not win without convincing Americans he is his own man. But he can not break with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> dramatically, for that would shatter <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hold on the conservative foundation of his bid for the White House. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does want to be identified with low unemployment, continuing prosperity and a declining trade deficit _ all current conditions the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration brags about. But he is falling in the polls against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in part because he has failed thus far to paint for the voters a vivid picture of what he would do as president. As New Jersey Gov. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said Thursday, `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is a very popular man, but nobody wants a clone.'' The White House appeared to ease the way for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` He has his ideas on how he's going to want to do things, and that's fine.'' A weeklong trip through the West demonstrated graphically the easy and the hard choices <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must make in the next six months to try to put together a winning coalition in the fall. In the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hit hard on protecting the environment, proclaiming that the government must do more. He did n't directly criticize the environmental record of the administration, but he did break cleanly with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on one issue Monday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would act to stop the sources of acid rain, while the administration just wants to study the problem more. This was an easy one for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for the environment is close to a motherhood issue. No one is against clean air and clean water, even though there are disagreements on how to achieve those goals. And acid rain is not a burning issue for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, nor is it one that is central to the basic <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> constituencies. The hard choices for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> come in packages like the administration's dealings with Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for involvement in drug-running, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is thinking of dropping the indictments if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will give up power. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first reaction was to say that talking about sensitive matters is a mistake. Of course, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was talking _ albeit carefully _ about the negotiations. Next the vice president said he wanted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, leaving the impression perhaps, that a deal dropping the charges was all right. Then, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried yet another formulation with yet a different emphasis. He said Friday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, he wanted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` brought to justice.'' That meant he was against dropping the indictment, right? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would n't say and neither would aides. It was a precisely vague phrase, for bringing someone into court is only one meaning of `` justice.'' This careful wording did n't draw the attention <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted and thus did n't deal with the problem. At every stop, reporters shouted questions to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> heir-apparent on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would smile and just say nothing. Wednesday brought yet another effort. `` Drug dealers are domestic terrorists, killing kids and cops and they should be treated as such,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. `` I wo n't bargain with terrorists and I wo n't bargain with drug dealers either, whether they are on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or foreign soil. He did n't say <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. And aides were quick to say he was not talking about the current situation, only what he would do in the future. Now there was no doubt that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to leave the impression that he simply would not cut a plea-bargaining deal with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. To say it clearly would have been critical of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a step into the middle of a mess <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would like to avoid as much as possible. So <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to say it without saying it. But the problem is a simple one _ it does not answer the basic question: What does <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> think of the proposed deal? So the questions will continue, as long as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is on the front pages. Likewise with the scandals swirling around Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has refused to comment and so he faces questioning almost every day on whether or not he thinks <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should resign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides will talk privately about the need for the vice president to step away from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself is the one arguing the time is not yet ripe for clear and definitive moves. The problem for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as an aide once said, is that he is the Velcro candidate _ everything sticks to him. To win in the fall, that must change for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Fishing Contest Cruel to Animals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMM, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court has fined two organizers of a fishing contest about $ 700 each for cruelty to animals, ruling that fish feel pain when hooked and pulled from the water. The April 18 decision grew out of a suit filed by an animal rights group against a local angling club that staged a fishing contest two years ago. The object of the contest was to see which fisherman could catch the most pounds of fish in two days. After the fish were pulled in and weighed, they were returned to the water. Civil court Judge <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkmann </PERSON> based his decision on testimony of experts called in to determine whether or not fish feel pain when hooked, and if they suffered during the time they were out of the water. Four wildlife experts testified that an increased heart rate and labored breathing of the fish after they were pulled from the water indicated that they feel pain. <PERSON> Brinkmann </PERSON> ruled that fishing was permissible if fish were quickly killed, and if they were caught for useful purposes. But he added that simply catching the fish to weigh and determine which angler was more skilled subjected the creatures to unusually cruel treatment. `` Fishing contests serve no further purpose than to determine who has won,'' <PERSON> Brinkmann </PERSON> ruled.

 Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded Thursday to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ` s call for a bipartisan task force on drugs by criticizing administration cutbacks on money for drug education and enforcement. `` I have no problem with another study,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor told a news conference. But he then added, `` I do n't think we need another study.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that in 1985 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed `` a sweeping drug education prevention act'' and then four months later cut 50 percent from the funding that had been agreed upon. `` There are modest sums that have been appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for state and local law enforcement agencies to fight this war against drugs. The president is the one who zeroed them out,'' he said. Apparently unwilling to flatly reject <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s call for a bipartisan effort, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` This is a bipartisan issue. There is no question about that. There is no Republican or Democratic or Independent way to fight it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned half a day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Thursday. They are the two biggest states holding primaries on June 7, the day <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hopes to bring his delegate total over the 2,081 needed to lock up the Democratic presidential nomination. He denied he was already looking at potential running mates. `` There was not a word of truth in that article,'' he said of a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> story that said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides were looking closely at Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of New Jersesy for the second spot on the ticket. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has said he is n't interested. `` I have n't even thought about it,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. After the last Democratic primaries on June 7, he said, `` there will be plenty of time to be thinking about running mates.'' He added that no member of his staff was authorized to discuss the selection process. He said he would make his choice `` thoughtfully and with a certain amount of reflection.''

<HEAD>Party Delegates To Debate Kadar Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> delegates gather Friday to consider changes in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s divided leadership, including the possible replacement of party leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, the party's general secretary since the Soviets crushed a revolt in 1956, has been increasingly blamed for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s deepening economic crisis and for resisting political reforms `` <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> has come to personify the mistakes that have been made in the past,'' said a prominent party official, who spoke on condition he not be identified further. `` No real change can occur as long as he remains on top,'' the official said, adding that a growing number of party members wants to see him step down. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders are under mounting pressure from both inside and outside the party to adopt political reforms as a first step in revitalizing the nation's stagnating economy. Last week, the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said personnel changes would be high on the conference agenda, fueling speculation <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> would be asked to step aside. However, Western diplomatic sources say there is still no clear indication that <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> intends to relinquish control soon. `` The situation is very fluid and the outcome -LRB- of the conference -RRB- is almost impossible to predict,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat, who requested anonymity. Any changes in the party leadership would likely be announced after a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting scheduled for Sunday. While <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> pioneered reforms that made the country relatively prosperous in the late 1960s and 1970s, a series of recent economic setbacks and austerity measures imposed to curb them have angered many Hungarians. Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, a leading contender to succeed <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, has said that the political future of the party leader may be up for debate during the conference, the first since 1957. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> has said in recent interviews that he would step down if asked. In addition to personnel issues, some 900 delegates are to debate a package of economic refoms and proposals for modest political changes drafted by <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>. Reformists in the party say the political reforms _ which include provisions for secret ballots, limited terms of office for party officials and multicandidate elections _ do not go far enough. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, an outspoken <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member and a leading proponent of reforms, has called for changes in the constitution that would provide for referendums and guarantee the independence of a growing number of political interest groups. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> sponsored <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, has also urged that the leading role of the Communist Party be reviewed. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> announced last week that the delegates would discuss the `` party's tasks and the development of the political system.'' A commentary published in the latest edition of <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ifjusag </ORGANIZATION>, the official newspaper of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, also called for changes, saying that `` internal instransigence within the party has come to hamper roads to reform.'' The economic weekly <PERSON> Figyeloe </PERSON> said in an editorial Thursday that the conference `` will be a turning point in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s national destiny.'' `` Economic reforms can not be separated from the political sphere,'' the editorial said. A gross foreign debt of more than $ 17 billion and rising inflation led <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s leaders this year to impose Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s first personal and value added taxes. Many Hungarians, whose standard of living has been hit hard by the measures, are calling for more of a voice in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic and political affairs.

 Historic <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s Southern charm will take on the air of a European fairy tale Friday when the <ORGANIZATION> Spoleto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> opens for its 17-day run. In its annual rite of spring, the city is transformed into a carnival of the performing arts, with music, dancing and drama everywhere. Streets are adorned with colorful banners and street corners become impromptu stages for mimes and musicians. The fairy-tale motif also will make its way to stages around the city during this year's 12th edition of the festival founded by composer <PERSON> Gian </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Menotti </PERSON> and patterned after its namesake festival in <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION>'88 _ the most ambitious <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> to date _ will open its run with the traditional round of speeches on the steps of City Hall. There'll be a brass fanfare and a samba band from `` The Warrior Ant'' _ a work by director <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruer </PERSON> and composer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Telson </PERSON> featuring more than 50 dancers, musicians and actors, which will have its world premiere during <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION>. Later Friday, the festival's major opera, <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON>'s `` Rusalka,'' goes on the boards at the <ORGANIZATION> Gaillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION>. The work, based on a Czechoslovakian fairy tale and rarely produced in this country, is filled with sprites, gnomes and witches. The <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> version is replete with special effects and will be sung in <LOCATION> Czech </LOCATION>. However, slides with the English translation will be projected over the stage for festivalgoers. Echoing the fairy-tale theme is `` Miracolo d'Amore'' -LRB- Miracle of Love -RRB-, a dance-theater piece by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> choreographer <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>. The work is based on Italian fairy tales and may prove somewhat controversial in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> because it features some nudity. However, it's not the first time there's been nudity on stage at the festival. And, from 12th century <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, comes the musical drama `` <PERSON> Herod </PERSON> and the Innocents,'' performed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Ensemble For Early Music. Other highlights include <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Henrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Graun </PERSON>'s 1755 opera `` Montezuma'' about the Spanish destruction of the Aztec civilization in the 1500s and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debut of the <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. The popular Circus Flora featuring <LOCATION> Flora </LOCATION> the elephant, which played to packed houses at <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> two years ago, is back for an encore this season. Festival ticket sales have been brisk, said General Manager <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Redden </PERSON>, who added organizers expect to surpass last year's record box office All in all, there will be 112 performances featuring 550 performers before the festival closes with a concert and fireworks display at nearby <LOCATION> Middleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plantation </LOCATION> on June 5. There'll also be dozens of additional performances for Piccolo Spoleto -LRB- Little <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> -RRB-, the companion arts festival staged by the city of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The judge who declared a mistrial in a conspiracy case against political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> has scheduled a new trial for October and challenged a defense request to question <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> claims tried to ruin him. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> has set the trial for Oct. 3, he will first have to rule on defense contentions that retrying <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and his followers would violate their constitutional protection against being tried twice on the same charges. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> last week ordered defense lawyers to submit written arguments on the double jeopardy issue by July 15 and given Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> until Aug. 1 to respond. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> is expected to rule before a Sept. 8 status hearing. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> declared the mistrial last month following complaints from several jurors, who had been told when the trial began in December that it would last about six months but later were told it might last up to a year. The judge was careful to note he blamed the mistrial both on lengthy hearings needed because of alleged government withholding of documents from defense lawyers and on `` agressive behavior'' by defense lawyers, a comment widely interpreted as an indication <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> would reject arguments that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and the others can not be retried because the mistrial was the prosecution's fault. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, six aides and five <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> political groups were charged with conspiring to obstruct a 1986 federal grand jury investigation of allegations that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign raised more than $ 1 million through credit card fraud and another $ 1 million or more through loan fraud. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, who is making his fourth run for the presidency, contends the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> infiltrated his organizations because of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration anger at his refusal to support efforts to arm the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> contends the infiltration and fabrication of evidence of fraud was directed by <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel who ran a Contra resupply network from the White House at a time when such aid was prohibited by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Defense lawyers have sought to question North from the outset of the case and stepped up the effort three months ago after obtaining a declassified memo written to North in which another key player in the Iran-Contra affair, retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, mentioned an associate's efforts to gather `` info against <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> last week ordered defense lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON>, who is handling the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> request, to refine his lengthy arguments on the request in a memo outlining what testimony defense lawyers believe <PERSON> North </PERSON> could give that would be relevant to the case. <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> has opposed the request and said that he likely would have to grant North immunity if <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> ordered him to testify because <PERSON> North </PERSON> is under indictment for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal.

 A Jewish group asked a French bank Thursday for financial records to trace millions of dollars earmarked for Holocaust survivors that allegedly were embezzled by the group's former leader. Jewish officials said it was still not certain how much money late Central Jewish Council leader <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> allegedly took nor where the funds went. <ORGANIZATION> Hesse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> radio, without citing sources, said that <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> may have embezzled up to $ 24 million, a much higher figure than previously reported. Some of the money appears to have gone to a fashion store <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> owned, the radio said. The radio station also said `` higher-level officials'' moved to block a <ORGANIZATION> Karlsruhe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> audit of <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON>'s records in 1980. But the tax office's director, <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, flatly denied the report. `` No audit of his -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nachmann </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- accounts was ever ordered, and could therefore not have been blocked,'' <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, who took over the council's leadership after <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON>'s death in January, was to meet with an aide to Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> Friday to discuss the incident. <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> said he and the <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> assistant, <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>, would seek to determine whether government officials should have better monitored the flow of money paid by West German for Holocaust survivors. <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, in an interview, said the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Karlsruhe </ORGANIZATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alsacienne </ORGANIZATION> for full financial records of <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON>'s transactions. The French bank handled some of <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON>'s accounts and an account belonging to the Jewish Council, according to <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> said earlier this week that <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> appeared to have embezzled about $ 6 million since 1980. The <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> family's attorney, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Paepcke </PERSON>, said he believes <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> apparently took the money to help bolster his failing Karlsruhe-based textile business, but added that he had been unable to trace the funds. The attorney filed for bankruptcy for <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON>'s heirs and his business on March 30. The proceedings opened Thursday, <PERSON> Paepcke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> from 1965 until his death at age 62 in January, was in charge of disbursing the government funds to Holocaust survivors around the world. About $ 236 million was allocated by the West German government in 1980 for Holocaust survivors who had not previously made reparations claims. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Karlsruhe </ORGANIZATION> prosecutors said they would seek to determine whether other people may have been involved in the embezzling case. <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON>'s family fled <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1938. He returned in 1945 and began working toward re-establishing Jewish communities in the country. About 530,000 Jews lived in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> when the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> took power in 1933. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has about 30,000 Jewish residents today.

 Jury selection began today in former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s criminal trial on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. About 100 prospective jurors filed into the <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> room and then were sworn in the first step in choosing a jury for the ousted governor and his brother, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>. The Mechams did not attend today's court session. The former governor's attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> probably would attend next week, after the field is narrowed and questioning of prospective jurors begins. On Wednesday, a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice refused a defense request to delay the trial until the high court considers a defense motion to return the charges to the state grand jury. However, the justice agreed that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will hear arguments on that issue June 1. The state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected a defense claim Monday that the Mechams were denied `` substantial procedural rights'' in the grand jury process. The former governor said he could not predict whether he will fare any better in court than he did at his state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> removed the 64-year-old Republican on April 4, a year into his first term. `` I have n't broken any laws,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I looked at the laws. My attorney looked at the laws. We've had experts look at the laws. We have n't broken any of them.'' The prospective jurors were given a questionnaire worked out by the prosecution, defense and trial Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and designed to ferret out obvious bias for or against the former governor. `` Please do not withhold any information in order to be seated on this jury,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> told the prospective jurors. The 99 questions included whether the prospective jurors know anyone involved in the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> case and whether they signed or circulated petitions for or against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> while he was governor. Others asked about favorite television shows and whether prospective jurors have bumper stickers on their cars. The field is to be narrowed by the attorneys and judge with the remaining prospective jurors to be called back for questioning either Monday or Tuesday. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> faces six felony counts on three charges _ perjury, filing false documents and fraud _ accusing him of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar counts. Prosecutors said the Mechams failed to report the loan from <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> on personal or campaign financial statements until after a newspaper reported the contribution. The former governor could face up to 22 years in prison if he is convicted on all six counts. If the attorneys are unable to choose an impartial jury from the initial pool of 100, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> has said he probably will seek either to dismiss the charges or to move the trial to another location. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said other motions may be filed before trial testimony begins, probably after Memorial Day. Both sides have said they expect testimony to take two to three weeks. In papers filed Wednesday with the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, defense attorneys said the Mechams were entitled to `` an adequately informed and properly instructed grand jury.'' `` Instead the attorney general's office, in its inordinate thirst for an indictment, and perhaps the celebrity that prosecuting a controversial governor can bring, repeatedly tested the very limits of judicial tolerance to which they might go in the manipulation of this grand jury,'' the defense said. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s attorneys contend that prosecutors were not justified in pursuing a grand jury indictment after an earlier grand jury was disbanded. Also Wednesday, the defense asked <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> to reconsider a claim that the Mechams were victims of selective prosecution. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> has rejected several other defense motions, including a proposed change of venue and a motion by <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> for separate trials. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was convicted in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of trying to thwart a death threat investigation and of misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning the money to his auto dealership He also was impeached on charges of concealing the $ 350,000 loan, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided not to consider that charge for fear of prejudicing <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s criminal trial.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received an open invitation from the White House Thursday to express policy differences without fearing criticism `` in any way'' from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hit administration cutbacks in money for drug education. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Democratic challenger, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, campaigned on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, but spent most of the day in private meetings. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has the Republican presidential nomination locked up, also spent most of the day working privately. But the political repercussions continued from his declaration on Wednesday that he would not negotiate with drug dealers _ an implied disagreement with administration talks with <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the Panamanian general facing drug charges in this country. The vice president's comment dominated the daily press briefing at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said no offense was taken by the president. `` As we go through the campaign, I would expect to see the vice president speaking out on a number of issues,'' he said. `` I expect a number of them will be different than existing policies and ... we will not, we will not criticize them ... in any way.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> defended the administration's approach to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, which White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has likened to `` plea bargaining. But the spokesman also gave these words of advice to White House reporters: `` If you want to drive a wedge between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the vice president, forget it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received his free-expression pass from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as public opinion polls showed him losing ground to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the all-but-certain Democratic nominee, a decline widely believed linked in part to controversies involving <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and embattled Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The vice president, who stressed his loyalty to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during the early, competitive weeks of the primary campaign, has been receiving unsolicited advice from <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> allies that he needs to establish his own identity with the voters. `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is a very popular man but nobody wants a clone,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, interviewed while visiting <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> `` He must separate himself from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent part of the day campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The two states are among four that hold primary elections on June 7, the last day of the Democratic primary season. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is heavily favored to defeat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in both those primaries, and aides say he will have enough delegates to assure his nomination by the time the results of those elections are counted. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor responded mildly to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s call for a bipartisan drug study commission. `` I have no problem with another study,'' he said, although he also added, `` I do n't think we need another study.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also criticized the administration as he spoke to community leaders in a <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, neighborhood known for drug problems. He said that in 1985, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed `` a sweeping drug education prevention act'' and then four months later cut the funding in half. `` There are modest sums that have been appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for state and local law enforcement agencies to fight this war against drugs. The president is the one who zeroed them out,'' he said.

 A pastor charged with raping two teen-agers required members of his church to turn over their savings accounts to him and furnish tax records to prove they were giving enough to the church. Law enforcement sources also said Wednesday that newlywed members of the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Streitferdt </PERSON>'s True Church of God were required to honeymoon at a church-owned resort in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and to register babies at the church's school. In order to get to heaven, he told his congregants, they had to be buried at the church-owned cemetery in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, according to the sources, who spoke on condition their names not be used. <PERSON> Streitferdt </PERSON> took complete personal charge of the savings accounts of many of his members and offered them other banking services, the sources said. He is free on $ 25,000 bail following his arraignment Monday on two counts each of first-degree rape and first-degree sodomy involving two sisters, age 14 and 16. A hearing was scheduled for Friday. A <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> minister who spoke Wednesday on condition of anonymity said some members of <PERSON> Streitferdt </PERSON>'s church said that the pastor required them to show him their W-2 forms to prove they were giving part of their incomes to the church. The minister said members of the church, located in a poor <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> neighborhood, called him fearing they would be charged with tax violations, following news reports of questionable financial activities by <PERSON> Streitferdt </PERSON>. Law enforcement sources said tax and financial records of the church and <PERSON> Streitferdt </PERSON> will be subpoenaed. The sources said a two-year investigation showed the pastor registered possessions in the name of a church or religious group. Among the possessions is a $ 1.4 million waterfront estate on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where the pastor, who is white, lives with his wife, who is black. It also includes several <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> automobiles, property in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, a honeymoon resort in <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Rose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Linden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` Everything is owned by the church,'' confirmed <PERSON> Streitferdt </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzweig </PERSON>, who added, `` It's a legitimate church. He called <PERSON> Streitferdt </PERSON> `` an honorable, deeply religious man who tries his best to help people.'' The law enforcement sources said <PERSON> Streitferdt </PERSON> had churches in other cities, including <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, and in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. To finance purchase of the properties, including the lavish <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> church, <PERSON> Streitferdt </PERSON> required an annual 10 percent tithe from his 700 members, except every third year when he required 30 percent. <PERSON> Streitferdt </PERSON> required that children born to congregants be registered, for a fee, with the church's school at the age of 6 months, sources said. Tuition is $ 600 at the school, which is not regulated by the state because it does not go through the 12th grade or offer diplomas. The <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> church, dedicated in 1975, was locked Wednesday. A church employee said <PERSON> Streitferdt </PERSON> was not in the building but would conduct services Sunday morning.

 Two missiles fell accidentally from a Soviet military jet and exploded on a private farm Thursday, damaging buildings and knocking out power but causing no injuries, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. The accident occurred near the southwestern town of <LOCATION> Przemkow </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Legnica </LOCATION> province, the report said. It gave no details on how the accident occurred. The province is home base for the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> It is 200 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and about 50 miles from the East German border. A resident reached by telephone said test flights are common in the area. One year ago Thursday, a rocket accidentally dropped by a Soviet fighter exploded in a barnyard in <LOCATION> Wilkocin </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Przemkow </LOCATION>, killing one man and injuring two people. The <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> report said the latest accident left two craters in a private farm field, cracks and splits in some buildings and unspecified damage to `` roof structures.'' Also damaged was a 300-yard section of high-power lines, interrupting electricity and shutting down the water pumping system for Przemkow, a town of about 5,000 people. Police in <LOCATION> Przemkow </LOCATION> declined comment. But the resident said the missiles fell several hundred yards from the nearest homes, setting off loud explosions that knocked out windows. `` Luckily the missiles fell outside any residential area ... because it would have been an awful thing,'' the man said. He said one missile could be seen passing over the town into the fields. `` It made a great big crater.''

 Sea World trainers have returned to the water to train with killer whales under stricter safety guidelines, but no performances with humans and the giant mammals together are scheduled. `` I would say that the biggest change is in the raised experience level of the trainers,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarpuzzi </PERSON>, the marine park's new director of training. `` From now on, trainers have to have a minimum of four years of experience before they can even get in the water.'' <PERSON> Scarpuzzi </PERSON> would not specify when the trainers would go back into the pool for performances. But he said Wednesday it probably woudl be soon. The trainers were ordered out of the water following a series of accidents last year, including one in November in which a trainer with two years of experience was critically hurt when a whale landed on him during a show.

 Four foreigners and two white Zimbabweans detained as alleged South African spies appeared in court Thursday, and the government said it needed more time to investigate the case.

Prosecutor <PERSON> Tadius </PERSON> <PERSON> Karwi </PERSON> told magistrate <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutezo </PERSON> the state expected it would be ready to fix a trial date at the hearing. The six _ two Britons, a Canadian, an Irishman and two Zimbabweans _ face charges under <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s official secrets act which carry a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment on conviction. They were detained under emergency powers regulations in September after <PERSON> Ivor </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>, 55, a Zimbabwean, was allegedly found at <LOCATION> Beitbridge </LOCATION> border post adjoining <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with information on Zimbabwe-based officials of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves to Tighten Control of PCB Handlers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation designed to close a loophole in the handling of highly toxic chemicals known as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, was approved Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The bill, endorsed by a voice vote, would require the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to write regulations controlling so-called <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> brokers, the middlemen who contract to transport the chemicals to disposal sites. `` There is no federal manifesting requirement to adequately track PCBs from owner to final disposal,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., the bill's principal sponsor `` Literally, anybody with a truck can get into the <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> brokerage business.'' The manufacture of PCBs, most often used as insulators in electrical equipment, has been banned since the late 1970s. The nation faces a growing rate of <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> disposal in the coming years as this equipment wears out. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said the broker loophole has resulted in PCB dump-and-run cases across the nation. One broker who was paid millions of dollars to handle disposal of 13 -LCB- million pounds of the chemicals left them in <LOCATION> Holden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and went bankrupt, leaving behind a site cleanup bill of more than $ 30 million, he said. The legislation would require <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to set up a system to keep track of PCBs once they leave the original owner and to require brokers to demonstrate they have the financial capability of assuring safe disposal. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the bill has the support of the environmental and business communities and of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, which is drafting the type of regulations that would be required by the legislation. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, said lawmakers feel <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> should have a congressional directive to regulate <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> brokers in case the president's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> opposes such action. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> have tangled during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over the issue of whether the environmental agency should issue regulations that have n't been specifically mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, the biggest foreign drug dealer ever brought to trial in this country, was found guilty today of running a smuggling operation that shipped tons of cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The verdict against the reputed leader of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s violent <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel came just after 11 a.m. following seven days of deliberation. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, and co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, were convicted of conspiring to smuggle 3.3 tons of cocaine, by way of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, from 1978 to 1980. Prosecutors and government witnesses had described <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> as a one-time <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> street hood who put together a vast cocaine-smuggling empire after he was deported to his homeland. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> called him the <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of drug trafficking, pioneering mass shipments of cocaine by air from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At a news conference this afternoon, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> called the verdict `` a victory for the good guys.'' Asked whether <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> would spend the rest of his life in jail, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said: `` I certainly hope so. ... That is certainly going to be my recommendation.'' <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was found guilty on all counts: one count of conspiracy, two of importation of cocaine, seven of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and one of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. He looked down, then stared straight ahead as the court clerk read the verdicts. Two jurors cried, with one sobbing and burying her face in her hands, as the seven-month trial came to an end. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was convicted on a single conspiracy count and faces up to 15 years in prison and $ 25,000 in fines. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> now faces life plus 150 years in prison and up to $ 350,000 in fines. Following the verdict on the charges, the jury had to consider whether <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> should be forced to forfeit all his Bahamian property, including large parts of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, several homes, an airstrip and possibly a number of planes, to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The jury returned to deliberations after a brief hearing, and attorneys both sides refused immediate comment. `` If it's any good, it's worth waiting for,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> quipped when asked for reaction to the verdict. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, commenting to reporters outside <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> today, cited a `` fine job'' by the prosecutor and investigating agents and said the case was `` an excellent example of international cooperation ... against a major drug trafficker.'' Authorities said the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>, named for a city in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, was believed to be responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Prosecutors called <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> the biggest foreign drug smuggler ever brought to trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Jurors' names have not been revealed for security reasons, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> had the foreman sign the verdict form only with his number. When <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was first brought to the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> federal courthouse, a small army of police armed with shotguns and automatic weapons surrounded the building. Security eased during the trial, but each day up to 10 federal marshals were in the courtroom. During the trial, witnesses told of <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s flamboyant personality, which included admiration for both <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and former Beatle <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>. Witnesses said <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, after initially smuggling the drug himself and paying `` mules'' to fly between <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, earned a stake that allowed him to fly his own shipments. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> allegedly paid off <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> to look the other way while his smuggling operation took over the small island of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, a short hop from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, himself reportedly a target of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand jury investigation based in part on trial testimony, has called the charges a `` fairy tale.'' The principal prosecution witness was <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, an ex-marine pilot running his own marijuana smuggling operation from the island. He teamed up with <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, but eventually fell out with <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s co-defendant <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, he said. After he was arrested in early 1981, he began cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who is under federal protection and has been given a new identity, testified about hauling 1,600 kilograms of cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> o <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, and flying tons of cocaine from the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island to airstrips in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The trial included a brief appearance by former <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>, who testified about being chased away from <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in 1978 when he tried to anchor there. `` I was the most naive yachtsman in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>,'' he said. Defense attorneys <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON> hammered away at the credibility of <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and other prosecution witnesses. They accused them of making deals to avoid punishment for their own crimes, and said <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was a legitimate businessman being victimized by drug investigators. In a surprise move, they presented no defense witnesses after the prosecution rested, sending the trial immediately to the jury. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was captured by the Colombian army on Feb. 4, 1987, after a firefight outside a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> mansion. He was immediately flown to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in a swift extradition move that caused controversy in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. A day before bringing in the verdict, the jury had reviewed a videotape made by <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in 1985 when he was a fugitive in the jungles of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` This is about political action and cocaine has become, and marijuana has become, a revolutionary weapon in the struggle against North American imperialism. Stimulants from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are the Achilles' heel of imperialism,'' <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> of threatening to kill federal judges if he were extradited. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s attorneys denied that, but the violent history of the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> made authorities cautious. Hundreds of Colombian officials have been murdered by drug lords connected to the cartel, including Justice Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara-Bonilla </PERSON>. The cartel also had a hand in the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> slaying of <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> `` Barry'' Seal, a top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug informant, according to the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is also named in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment for his role in the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>. But that indictment was not included in his extradition papers, and under the U.S.-Colombia treaty in effect at the time, he apparently can not be tried on the charges. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> also is reportedly the object of a sealed indictment in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Carol Burnett Donates Charwoman Costume to Smithsonian</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The orderly atmosphere at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> was broken by a shattering `` Tarzan'' yell on Thursday School children and elderly vacationers looked around expecting to see a group of noisy teens or someone dressed up like <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON>' jungle hero. What they found was comedienne <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> emerging from a news conference where she had just donated the charwoman costume she made famous on her television program to the museum's History of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> collection. `` I feel very proud,'' she said at the ceremony. `` This is a ten, a definite ten.'' A native of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, Miss <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> developed the Tarzan yell as a child and it has become one of her professional trademarks. `` I wish some of my folks were here,'' she said, `` especialy, my grandmother who raised me. This would be a kick for her.'' The costume consists of a plaid wool skirt, yellow checkered apron, flower print blouse, a red bandana, a ragged brown sweater, a mopcap, white gloves, sweat socks and high-top army boots. The charwoman character was created for Miss <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>'s 1963 television special, `` <ORGANIZATION> Carol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Company,'' in which the ragged cleaning lady performed a modified strip-tease in her work clothes. Miss <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> developed the skit after she heard a radio disc jockey allude to the fact that some American housewives were fond of practicing a strip-tease to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s `` The Stripper'' while doing their chores. `` It thought maybe I should do a charwoman cleaning up in a burlesque house after everyone is gone and then imagines she's <PERSON> Gypsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>,'' Miss <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said `` All I really took off was the sweater and one long glove _ I decided there was enough violence on TV.'' The character, which the actress said never had a name or fully developed persona, became as signature figure on her comdey-variety TV series which ran from 1967 to 1978. Reminded that the gowns of the first ladies were also in the Smithsonian, Miss <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said, `` Maybe we'll call her First Charwoman.''

<TEXT>
 People infected by the AIDS virus may be more likely to go on to develop the deadly disease if they also are infected by a related virus that can cause a particularly fatal form of leukemia, a study says. `` These laboratory results suggest that doubly infected individuals have a worse prognosis for developing AIDS'' than those who are infected only by the AIDS virus, said molecular virologist <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> S.Y. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, who published his study in Friday's issue of the journal Science. `` The chances of any individual being infected by both viruses are very slim, but among selected populations, such as intravenous drug abusers, the chances are quite high,'' said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Except among IV drug abusers, the leukemia virus is quite rare in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It is fairly common in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said. So the study suggests that people in those areas may be more likely to develop full-fledged AIDS if they are exposed to the AIDS virus. But more study of people infected by both viruses must be done to confirm the suspicion raised by laboratory studies, said Dr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, chief of AIDS epidemiology at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> is already undertaking such research in the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which usually remains dormant in infected people for years before it may be activated to cause full-fledged AIDS, which cripples the disease-fighting immune system. Previous studies suggested almost any infection may help trigger the dormant AIDS virus into an active killer. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> and his colleagues performed experiments in laboratory culture dishes showing that AIDS-infected white blood cells called T cells produce large amounts of active AIDS virus if the cells also are exposed to the human T-cell leukemia virus type I, or HTLV-I. People infected by HTLV-I have a 1 percent lifetime chance of developing a blood cancer called adult T-cell leukemia, which often kills quickly. It is an important cause of leukemia in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. HTLV-I also is linked to a potentially fatal, degenerative nerve disease that causes spasticity and paralysis of the legs. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> recommended that all donated blood be tested for HTLV-I as soon as scientists develop a practical test. A <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> study found about one out of every 4,286 units of donated blood carries HTLV-I. The risk of AIDS virus in blood has been reduced to about one in 40,000 units because donors are tested for signs of AIDS infection. A study performed by <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> when he worked for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> showed HTLV-I is spreading among intravenous drug abusers, with infection rates of 12 percent among <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> addicts, 33 percent among <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> addicts overall, and 49 percent among black addicts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Intravenous drug addicts also are high risk for infection by the AIDS virus, which also is spread in blood on shared needles and by sexual contact. Infection by HTLV-I apparently activates the AIDS virus by stimulating AIDS-infected white blood cells to divide, according to the study <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> performed with molecular virologists <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cann </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugo </PERSON>. While the study in Science deals only with HTLV-I, unpublished laboratory results suggest full-fledged AIDS also may be triggered in AIDS-infected people who also are infected by HTLV-II, an extremely rare virus that can cause another type of leukemia. The AIDS virus is distantly related to the leukemia viruses. Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> expert on HTLV-I, agreed with <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> that the problem of dual infection by the AIDS and leukemia viruses is mainly a problem for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug addicts and for people in areas such as the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A student rediscovered a forgotten hoard of grain, dried fruit, spices and insects from the 3,300-year-old tomb of the Egyptian King Tutankhamun, archaeologists said Thursday. `` It obviously is extremely important archaelogically because it's a very large amount of material,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeology </ORGANIZATION>. `` Very little work has been done on material of this period in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and I understand that some of the species which have been identified are, in fact, the earliest occurrences,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said at a news conference. Most of the discovery consists of the food placed in Tutankhamun's tomb to sustain him on his journey to the afterlife. Scientists said the material is well preserved and could provide best evidence to date of the diet and lifestyle of the Egyptians at the time of <PERSON> Tutankhamun </PERSON>'s death in 1323 B.C. For more than 50 years, the hoard has lain undisturbed in 30 cardboard boxes in a musty storeroom at the Royal Botanical Gardens. The specimens were sent in 1932 by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, the British archaeologist who discovered <PERSON> Tutankhamun </PERSON>'s treasure-laden tomb in the Valleys of the <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, in 1922. They were to have been cataloged by the botanist <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boodle </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Boodle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> both died in the 1930s before the work could be completed, and the specimens were stored in boxes labeled `` From Ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.'' In February of this year, the material was turned over to a French graduate student at the archaelogical institute, 23-year-old <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutundjian </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vartavan </PERSON>, for research leading to a master's degree in archaeobotany, the institute's speciality. He recognized notations on the boxes as those of <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, providing the first clue that they might be from Tutankhamun's tomb Scientific analysis confirmed his theory and eventually fragments were matched with photographs taken by <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` It all fit in. It was beyond coincidence,'' said archaeobotanist <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillmann </PERSON>, who supervised the student's work. <PERSON> Tutundjian </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vartavan </PERSON> did not attend the news conference. Professor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, director of the archaeology institute's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION>, said the announcement was delayed until it had completed scientific analysis `` We were anxious to announce it as soon as possible, lest it should leak out, but we felt we had to keep it under wraps as long as possible, so that we could get as much work accomplished as we could,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. He acknowledged that one reason for the secrecy was concern that the Egyptian government might demand possession before the institute had completed its analysis. Last week, the institute informed the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> about the discovery and offered to return the material. As of Thursday, the institute had received no reply, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. The hoard includes fragments of funeral wreaths and more than five pounds of seeds, fruits and spices placed in Tutankhamun's tomb, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said Among identified species are emmer wheat for making bread on the journey, barley for brewing beer, a large quantity of watermelon seeds to chew on, coriander, fenugreek, black cumin, sesame seeds, two kinds of juniper berries, grapes and a datelike fruit known as a jujube. The grains, fruits and seeds were intended as raw materials that figurines known as shawabtis found in the tomb would cultivate into food needed by the `` ka'' _ one of the king's souls _ in the afterlife, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a specialist in insects, said the remains of thousands of beetles also had been identified. The foods were to sustain the boy king through eternity, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said, `` but the insects got through first and had a pretty good crack at them.'' The find represents only a fraction of the food buried in the tomb. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the remainder is in 110 to 120 original wicker baskets and several pottery jars in the <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Dokki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> scientists who bounced radio waves off cloud-shrouded <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> detected huge blobs that may be lava flows and rings that may be volcanic crater rims, both very bright and possibly rich in fool's gold, a new study says. The study provides more evidence that <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' volcanoes erupted within the last few million years and possibly within recent centuries, said researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Their findings appear in Friday's issue of the journal Science, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Pioneer Venus orbiter, a spacecraft that still circles the second planet from the sun. <ORGANIZATION> JPL </ORGANIZATION> radar scientists <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurgens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> and geologist <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> transmitted radio waves from <PERSON> Goldstone </PERSON> to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' equatorial region. Half the waves bounced back to three 210-foot-diameter, dish-shaped antennas at the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> facility. The fuzzy radar pictures revealed bright, or highly reflective, rings of material on the surface, as well as bright blobs. The largest blob, measuring 350 miles long and 180 miles wide, apparently is a large lava flow and has a large mound, possibly a volcano, at its west end, <PERSON> Jurgens </PERSON> said. The largest ring is roughly 60 miles across and appears to be the rim of a crater caused by a meteorite impact. But other rings about 18 miles across may be rims of large volcanic craters called calderas, he said. The researchers speculate the blobs and rings are so highly reflective to radar because the lava flows and crater rims are rich in iron pyrite or other metallic minerals blasted to the surface of the planet by volcanic eruptions or meteorite impacts. Iron pyrite is known as fool's gold because it looks like gold. Because fool's gold or other metallic minerals should decompose and lose their reflectivity over time, the discovery `` certainly is evidence of relatively recent volcanism,'' since old craters lack bright rings, <PERSON> Jurgens </PERSON> said. It is n't possible to say whether `` recent'' means within the last few million years or last few centuries because researchers do n't know how quickly rocks break down on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Jurgens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, who is project scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mapper </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, set for launch next April. Radar readings from Pioneer suggested volcanoes existed on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. Previous radar pictures made from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and by Soviet spacecraft in 1983 revealed lava flows, volcanic craters and craters from meteorite impacts. But researchers do n't know if volcanoes still are active on the planet, which is covered by thick, acid-laden carbon dioxide clouds that prevent direct observation by telescopes. In 1984, scientists announced that <PERSON> Pioneer </PERSON> detected lightning bolts and a 50-fold increase in sulfur dioxide concentrations in <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' atmosphere after 1978. Because lightning and sulfur dioxide can be caused by eruptions, the discoveries suggested a gargantuan volcano may have erupted shortly before 1978. Other studies also found highly reflective features on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' mountains, but scientists debated whether the brightness was from volcanic metallic minerals or simply artificial brightness created by rough landscape The blobs and rings found by the <ORGANIZATION> JPL </ORGANIZATION> study are the first highly reflective features discovered on <LOCATION> Venusian </LOCATION> lowlands, and thus support the theory that the brightness is caused by metallic minerals, <PERSON> Jurgens </PERSON> said. `` It's a good working hypothesis to say these -LRB- blobs -RRB- are young lava flows,'' but the radar images are n't good enough to determine which rings are volcanic craters and which are impact craters, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Masursky </PERSON>, a planetary geologist with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` We'll settle this argument with <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>,'' which is scheduled to reach <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> in August 1990 and map most of the planet using radar, he said. `` Some of the big volcanoes on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> may still be active, which would be ... interesting,'' <PERSON> Masursky </PERSON> said. `` The only other places we have ongoing volcanism are the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s moon -RRB- Io.''

 A high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official on Thursday criticized plans by retreating Soviet forces to leave up to $ 1 billion in equipment and facilities for the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, and reaffirmed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intention to continue backing the Afghan rebels. `` There have been indications that we have picked up that the intention of the Soviets to turn over equipment and facilities will be on a fairly large scale,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, undersecretary of state for political affairs. `` We've heard estimates ranging from a half a billion to $ 1 billion worth of equipment and, or, installations and facilities,'' he added. `` That does n't strike me as a demonstration of tremendous restraint.'' He was referring to statements by Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, the Soviet commander in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, that the value of Soviet bases and equipment left behind after the withdrawal would be 600 million rubles, the equivalent of $ 1 billion. During negotiations that led to the Soviet agreement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to withdraw its estimated 115,000 Red Army troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials proposed a mutual phase-out of superpower military assistance to the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and U.S.-supported mujahadeen. The Soviets rejected the offer, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> kept its promise on the table, saying it would match Soviet restraint with `` symmetrical'' reductions in aid to the mujahadeen. Otherwise, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support to the rebels would continue. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said on Thursday, `` I would recall, simply, what we said at the time we signed the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement: that we retain the right to support our friends. We will exercise the right in the event the Soviets continue to supply equipment to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. And we'll have practical ways of accomplishing that purpose. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> made the comments to reporters while outlining various regional issues President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are likely to discuss at their <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, May 29-June 2. He declined to predict whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would ask <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to help ease the Soviet withdrawal by advising the mujahadeen to refrain from harassing <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces. As the first Soviet unit crossed into its homeland on Wednesday, there were reports that guerrilla attacks were continuing. `` The position we've taken on that has been generally that a prompt timetable would be one which is more likely to elicit cooperation from the mujahadeen.'' <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said. Beyond that, the best way to protect withdrawing forces from attack is to make `` local arrangements'' with guerrilla groups, he said. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the Afghan accord was criticized as betrayal of the resistance and an invitation to chaos and civil war. With the superpowers continuing the arms flow, `` What's to prevent a continuing series of civil wars?'' Rep. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, D-Mass., said at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asian and <LOCATION> Pacfic </LOCATION> affairs `` My fear is we are going to see a continung inferno in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that in time will lead to some kind of Soviet presence unacceptable to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, also said he was concerned about the `` apparent contradiction'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> vowing to halt `` interference'' in Afghan affairs while at the same time reserving the right to aid the rival factions. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, R-Ind., declared his `` disgust'' that `` our <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> with its appeasement policy has settled for half a loaf ... There is no substitute for victory and they -LRB- Afghan resistance -RRB- were well on their way to victory. We stopped them short of it.'' With the removal of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as the No. 1 issue on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s list of regional confrontations with the Soviets, more attention is likely to be given at the summit to conflicts in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said he was optimistic about the prospects for progress in resolving conflicts in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, in part because of what he termed `` quite successful'' talks recently among officials from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeking a formula under which all Cuban troops _ estimated at up to 45,000 _ would be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would turn over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to an independent government. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is hopeful that the Soviets will use their influence with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, but he expressed concern that a reported increase in the number of Cubans in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> might set back the process. To lay the groundwork for discussion of the issues at the summit, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> on Thursday winding up talks with a Soviet deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> reiterated administration views that the regional issue most ripe for settlement is the restoration of a neutral <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, which is controlled by an estimated 120,000 Vietnamese troops. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which is beset by major economic problems, has stated its intention to withdraw its forces in the early 1990s. `` The principal things we would like to see from the Soviets here are that they press <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to accelerate the timetable for their withdrawal,'' the official said. He also said the Soviets should talk directly with <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who represents the anti-Vietnamese factions.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on Thursday renewed his call for the resignation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and said that if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> does n't quit, `` the president ought to do it for him <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has launched a counterattack against his critics and has told conservatives that he wo n't quit in the absence of evidence of wrongdoing. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s comments, said, `` I think Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> ought to resign.'' `` The perception is that there's a great loss of morale'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> because of the ongoing investigations of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. Later, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said again that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should go and added, `` if he does n't do it, the president ought to do it for him.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> was commenting a day after <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> met with conservative senators to say again that he would n't quit. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee report issued earlier this month accused <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> of violating a White House policy by helping the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has been conducting a criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and other matters. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is expected to issue a report within several weeks which will raise ethical quetions about the behavior of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, according to sources familiar with the investigation. According to <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and any occupants of high political office should be willing to resign if their actions put their offices `` under a cloud.'' A president should tell his top appointees that `` if your actions are such to put the office under a cloud, you'll have to leave,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said.

 The Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, which resumed power production last week after more than 2 -LCB- years, shut down Thursday because a problem developed on the non-nuclear side of the plant, officials said. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sequoyah </ORGANIZATION> site director, said the Unit 2 reactor automatically shut down after a level control valve caused a problem in the feed water system. A <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> investigative team was looking into the cause of the valve problem. <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON> said all emergency systems functioned properly and the plant shut down safely.

 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> says he is unfazed that a morality clause at <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> prevents him from speaking there. `` I do n't get too upset about anything,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` It was just a group of young Republicans who wanted me to speak. If they have a policy, they have a policy, and I wo n't speak.'' The policy says that to appear at <ORGANIZATION> BYU </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, a speaker `` must not, in his or her personal life -LRB- as reflected in the news media and common understanding of the public -RRB-, have committed acts of immorality, dishonesty or other conduct that would make it inappropriate for the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> to feature him or her as a speaker.

 State-sponsored death squads and terrorist groups are blocking economic development in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, speakers at an international conference said Thursday. `` People like agricultural extension workers will not go out into rural areas organizing people into agricultural programs if by doing so they are branded as communists and are liable to be harassed, attacked and even murdered,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Linden </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> said the independent charity sponsored the two-day conference on the `` growing phenomenon'' of development projects shut down by death squads and vigilante groups. He said such shutdowns, which had occurred in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, had created anxieties in many development agencies including the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, a member of the country's ruling <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> said South African-backed death squads were `` destroying <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s potential for independent, self-sustaining economic development. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebelo </PERSON> blamed South African-sponsored attacks for severe food shortages. A Haitian priest said `` repression and terror'' by state-sponsored death squads remain the reality in his nation, the Western hemisphere's poorest country. The Rev. <PERSON> Freud </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, who is general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and Peace, said there is no possibility for development if people continue to be terrorized by the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, which started operating with backing from former President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> 30 years ago. In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, there is a growing perception that active church members, anti-nuclear activists and proponents of agrarian reform are communists or radicals, said a Philippine human rights advocate. Dr. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Serena </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diokno </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> to Disband Vigilantes, said these people and farmers have little chance for judicial recourse if they are harmed because vigilante groups enjoy government sanction. Mrs. <PERSON> Diokno </PERSON> said `` massive poverty and inequality, which cause and nurture insurgency, must be attacked from the roots.'' Author and university lecturer <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON> said that in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, economic development has been hindered not only by state-sponsored terrorism but by the continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in the region. <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> said virtually every speaker provided evidence that national security forces are sponsoring vigilante groups and death squads `` in one way or another.'' Some speakers, such as <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, said one solution to these paramilitary forces is for governments to be held accountable to world opinion. Others called for threatened groups to form their own self-defense units. But <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> said: `` Obviously the solution is going to be along the lines of strengthening poor communities with education, with community organanization and with the type of development projects that will ... give them the courage and the mutual trust and the solidarity among themselves to withstand some of these assualts.''

 Israeli officials in the occupied territories have jailed one out of every 200 Arab men over the age of 18 for six months without trial, a legislator said Thursday. In addition to the 1,900 jailed under emergency regulations requiring no trial or specific charges, another 8,100 Palestinians are in prison awaiting trial or serving sentences for specific actions, left-wing legislator <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said. `` The scale of the arrests shows the political echelon has lost all control over the situation,'' <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, alleged. Army and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials refused comment, saying only they were checking <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>'s figures. Chief military prosecutor Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Strachnov </PERSON> said last week that 5,000 Palestinians were jailed since the start of the Arab uprising on Dec. 8. Of those, 1,700 were being held without trial, he said. But former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that close to 2,000 Palestinians were being held without trial. <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>, a law professor, also criticized authorities for abolishing a legal safeguard that required administrative detainees to appear before a judge within four days of their arrest. The requirement was scrapped when the number of administrative detainees skyrocketed during the uprising, and <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> demanded reinstatement. Israeli officials have said the mass arrests have helped calm the violence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Also Thursday, the American-born director of the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> information service, said she visited a village of 6,000 near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> that was raided by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops for three straight days this week. <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Abukhater </PERSON>, originally of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said she saw five <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> homes with broken furniture and windows in the village of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laqya </LOCATION>, and the owners told her Israeli troops were responsible for the damage. She said six villagers were arrested in the raids and that local residents said many people were beaten. Mrs. <PERSON> Abukhater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Beit </PERSON> <PERSON> Laqya </PERSON> apparently was targeted because it is a so-called `` liberated'' village, meaning Arab residents have blocked off roads to outsiders and fly the Palestinian flag, outlawed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Two other `` liberated'' villages near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> were raided Wednesday, and one Palestinian was killed and 10 wounded, hospital officials said. About 300 Arabs were detained. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said that before the Arab uprising began, only about 70 Palestinians were held without trial under emergency regulations at any one time. He said the present detainees were denied special privileges, including access to radio, television and newspapers, that they are supposed to enjoy since their detention is viewed as a preventive measure instead of punishment. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said he also conducted a random study of 3,300 Arabs held for six months without trial and determined the average age of the detainee was 25. Fifteen percent of the detainees were between the ages of 16 and 21, while 58 percent were between 21 and 30 years old. In other developments: _ The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s military government permitted the reunification of 40 Palestinian families as a goodwill gesture. The military government applies stringent standards in issuing residency permits, for example often only granting temporary tourist visas to the foreign-born spouses of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents. As result, hundreds of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> families are separated. _ In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, a district court judge rejected a motion to release from custody four staff members of the ultra left-wing newspaper <PERSON> Derech </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanitzotz </PERSON>. The four were jailed for unspecified security offenses. Providing the first details on the case, the court said Thursday the prosecution presented evidence the defendants were members of a hostile organization, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 The method a smoker chooses to try to kick the habit is less important than a doctor's firm advice and the long-term support of others, a new survey says. `` There is no single intervention method clearly more effective for all people than the other methods,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON>, a Mayo Clinic heart specialist and co-author of the survey. He and his colleagues on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preventive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reviewed 39 studies of ways to stop smoking. Those techniques ranged from `` one-shot'' strategies such as sensory deprivation and injections, to combinations of techniques such as physician counseling, nicotine gum and behavorial therapy. `` Success was not associated with novel or unusual interventions,'' the team reported in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was the product of personalized smoking-cessation advice and assistance, repeated in different forms by several sources over the longest feasible period.'' Most effective were approaches in which physicians and counselors worked with smokers, and the smokers also attended stop-smoking groups and perhaps used booklets, videotapes and homework, <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> said. Nicotine gum was also helpful, though not everyone can use it, he said. After a six-month period, such programs achieved a success rate 37 percent above that for individuals trying to quit on their own, he said. Least effective, and often costly as well, were one-time techniques such as sensory deprivation treatments, he said. A related report in the Chicago-based medical journal said a blood-pressure drug called clonidine has been shown effective in reducing the craving to smoke. Seventy-one heavy smokers who had tried unsuccessfully to quit were recruited for the study. Thirty-three took clonidine and 38 took a tablet containing no medication. Neither group knew what it was taking. All subjects also underwent behavioral therapy. Six months after discontinuing medication, 27 percent of the clonidine subjects reported they were still not smoking compared with 5 percent of those who took the placebo, the researchers said. Clonidine, also marketed as Catapres, inhibits some of the action of the nervous system and has previously been shown to reduce opiate and alcohol withdrawal symptoms, the study said. Its success in helping people quit smoking is similar to that reported with nicotine gum, but clonidine may eventually prove superior because it does n't perpetuate nicotine dependence, the study suggested. But the researchers said larger studies over longer periods are needed before it becomes a standard treatment. One surprising finding, according to Dr. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was that 61 percent of the subjects had suffered from major depression at some time in their past. People who have made several attempts to stop smoking and failed often believe they have a `` moral weakness,'' the study said. But its findings suggest `` that for many smokers who try to stop and can not, the problem is not a moral one but rather an associated vulnerability between affective -LRB- mood -RRB- disorder and nicotine.''

 <PERSON> Wilberforce </PERSON>, a black and white tomcat who was a companion to four British prime ministers after straying into Downing Street in 1973, died in his sleep Thursday at the age of 15. The feline, often seen lounging on the front doorstep of the prime minister's official residence at No. 10 Downing St., developed a reputation for being `` the best mouser in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Wilberforce </PERSON> was found during the tenure of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, and served as a mouse-catcher and pet for successive administrations. `` He received lots of mail, people wanting to know how he was, wish him luck,'' and the Downing Street staff answered for him, a staff spokesman said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> talked to <LOCATION> Wilberforce </LOCATION> when she encountered him in the corridors of power, and she gave him a special farewell present when he retired to a private home at an undisclosed location in <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, more than a year ago. One of his last meals at Downing Street was a tasty tin of the best Soviet pilchards _ a kind of herring _ picked out specially by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> supermarket during a tour of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was saddened by the news of <ORGANIZATION> Wilberforce </ORGANIZATION>'s death, which was given to her at the end of a morning Cabinet meeting, her press office said. <PERSON> Wilberforce </PERSON> will be buried near his home, the office said.

<HEAD>Say Cheese: Museum Will Open With Pork Barrel Funding</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The new exhibit deals with a product that comes from cows, but to many lawmakers it's just plain pork: The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> of Cheese opened Thursday. Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Larraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> was scheduled to preside over the ribbon cutting for perhaps the state's most notorious pork-barrel project. The museum was developed with the help of money tucked into the state budget at <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON>'s request. The $ 425,000 museum received $ 175,000 over the past three years from the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s pork barrel, with the rest of the cost coming mainly from local sources in this central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> community The museum is housed in the former Weeks and Merry Cheese Factory, which shipped cheese to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> a century ago. The building was moved from nearby <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> here, a re-creation of a mid-19th century Erie Canal community. Cheese-making tools and equipment, including curd knives, cheese forms and a cheese press, were collected from barns and old cheese factories across the state. While almost everyone else calls it pork barrel spending, legislators and Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> refer to the allocations such as the ones to the museum as `` member items'' or `` legislative initiatives.'' The items, proposed by individual legislators, are reviewed by the state budget division but in general do n't get the kind of scrutiny that major spending items do. <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON>, who admits that `` the Cheese Museum sounded kind of funny the first time I heard it, too,'' said the project makes `` good economic sense'' for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, which lost more than 50 percent of its manufacturing jobs in the last decade. `` The people of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> have experienced three years of being the brunt of everybody's joke and recurring stories about pork barrel spending,'' said <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON>, a Syracuse Democrat. `` The cheese musem is something of which they are enormously proud,'' she said. She added that she hopes the publicity `` can be turned into an advertising plus for the tourist industry being developed by <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.'' Meanwhile, `` cheese museum'' continues to be synonymous with `` pork barrel'' and the brunt of jokes in the state capital, <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. Even <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> got a few guffaws Wednesday when asked why he was n't attending the ceremony `` I gave -LRB- scheduling aide <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Belinsky </PERSON> some beef when I found out I was going to be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> instead of the cheese museum,'' said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who will be watching his chief of staff, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Crotty </PERSON>, receive an award from a citizens' group. `` It was a close call, the cheese museum or <PERSON> Crotty </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Thursday rejected indirect White House criticism of his refusal to accept a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan and blamed <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders for blocking peace talks. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> did not directly criticize the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for issuing a statement that also praised his political rival, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who supports the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan. But leaders of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc accused the White House of interfering in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s domestic affairs, and warned such actions would backfire in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s November election. `` This will just strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> because we do n't want to be a banana republic,'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Magen </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the domestic <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The White House statement, issued after a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday between <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, praised <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> for `` the courage and wisdom to say yes when real opportunities arise.'' In an oblique reference to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, the statement criticized `` those leaders who are negative, consistently reject new ideas and fail to exploit realistic opportunities to bring about negotiations, make progress impossible. In the end, they will have to answer to their own people for the suffering that will inevitably result.'' Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> have governed in a fragile coalition since 1984, but the alliance has all but disintegrated because of the dispute over the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> backs the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan which calls for an international conference to launch direct talks between the parties to the conflict. The plan also provides for talks on a final settlement to begin by the end of 1988. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> objects to the international conference and to setting a timetable for negotiations. Responding to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> statement Thursday, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he did not believe it was directed at him. `` I think that if there are elements in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> who reject peace, who avoid peace talks, it's the Arab leaders,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted as saying by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also said he hoped the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue its policy of not interfering in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leaders, meanwhile, criticized <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, saying he should be recalled to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and had no authority to speak for the Israeli government. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio that `` we should always ask what's good for the state, not what's good for the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. I think this was a trip with important possibilities during which we explained <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s position in a positive way.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was scheduled to return to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Friday after a two-week trip that included stops in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> for meeting Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> demands that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> establish diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> before getting involved in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> cut the ties after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> an intensive dialogue with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s interest.

 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, removed from office last month by impeachment conviction, went on trial Thursday on criminal charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. About 100 prospective jurors were sworn in during the brief opening session at <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> did not attend. `` I have n't broken any laws,'' he said Wednesday. `` I looked at the laws. My attorney looked at the laws. We've had experts look at the laws. We have n't broken any of them.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother and 1986 campaign treasurer, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, are charged with perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents for failing to report a $ 350,000 campaign loan from a developer. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 64, could face up to 22 years in prison if convicted of all six felony counts. His brother could be sentenced to up to 9 -LCB- years if convicted of the three counts he faces. The former governor's attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> probably will attend court sessions next week, after the pool of prospective jurors is narrowed and questioning of individuals begins. Thursday, those in the jury pool were given a questionnaire worked out by the prosecution, defense and trial Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and designed to identify anyone biased for or against the former governor. `` Please do not withhold any information in order to be seated on this jury,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> told the prospective jurors. Thursday's session lasted about 15 minutes, and the prospective jurors left as they completed the questionnaires. There were few spectators besides reporters. The 99 questions included whether the panelists know anyone involved in the case; whether they signed or circulated petitions for or against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> while he was governor; whether they belong to the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>; whether they have bumper stickers on their cars. Also, they were asked whether they knew anyone on a long list of people associated with <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> or his criminal case. After the initial screening, the remaining prospective jurors are to be called back for questioning Tuesday or later next week. On Wednesday, a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice refused a defense request to delay the trial until the high court considers a defense motion to return the charges to the grand jury. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is to hear arguments on that issue June 1. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has refused to predict whether he will fare better in court than at his impeachment trial. The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> removed the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor April 4, 15 months into his first term by convicting him of two impeachment counts. Prosecutors said the Mechams failed to report the $ 350,000 loan from <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> on personal or campaign financial statements until after a newspaper reported the contribution in October 1987. The defense filed two new motions released Thursday, one to dismiss the charges based on a claim that the campaign and personal finance reporting laws are unconstitutionally `` vague, ambiguous, imprecise and overbroad.'' The other asks that the charges be remanded to the grand jury for a new finding of whether probable cause exists. That motion argued that grand jury materials were improperly turned over to the prosecutors in <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial. The defense contended it was denied access to grand jury transcripts, but the impeachment prosecutors were given documents by the attorney general's office. However, officials have said those documents were not transcripts of grand jury testimony. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> did not immediately schedule arguments on the motions. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON>, co-prosecutor in the criminal trial, said some of the defense requests were `` laser-beam mentality motions.'' The remark referred to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s claim earlier this year that Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s office was using laser beams to eavesdrop on conversations in the governor's office <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> denied doing so. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was convicted in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of trying to thwart a death threat investigation and of misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning the money to his auto dealership He also was impeached on charges of concealing the $ 350,000 loan, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided not to consider that charge for fear of prejudicing <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s criminal trial.

<HEAD>Baseball Players Prompt Suggestion that Right-handers Live Longer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A study of lifespans of baseball players leads two doctors to suggest that right-handed people may live slightly longer than left-handers. In a letter published Thursday in the science magazine Nature, they said they studied The Baseball Encyclopedia and found that right-handers averaged a lifespan of 64.64 years, compared with 63.97 years for left-handers. The letter was signed by <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpern </PERSON> of the psychology department of <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Coren </PERSON> of the psychology department of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. They said their study covered 1,472 right-handers and 236 left-handers, and excluded players who batted with one hand and threw with the other. No discrepancies appeared until after age 33. After that, about 2 percent more right-handers than left-handers survive at each following five-year period, the researchers said. They said the study gave no information about the possible cause of the apparent discrepancy, but suggested three possibilities: that left-handers may suffer stresses in the womb or around the time of birth that affect their longevity; that genetic effects or hormones may have hampered their immune system, or that `` left-handers may have more accidents in an environment designed for a right-handed majority.'' They concluded: `` These factors may act singly or in concert to account for the fact that left-handers seem to have a shorter lifespan.''

<TEXT>
 Senators renewed the government's pledge Thursday to stand behind deposits in the nation's savings and loan institutions, after a congressional agency reported the doubling of red ink in the federal S & amp; L insurance fund. `` There is absolutely no doubt the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stands behind our deposit insurance program,'' <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., said at a hearing by his panel <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, director of the accounting and financial management division of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said the liabilities of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> exceeded its assets by $ 13.7 billion at the end of 1987, up from $ 6.3 billion a year earlier. Further, he said, the money available to the insurance fund _ $ 28 billion over the next 10 years _ `` probably will not be adequate'' to restore the industry's health by closing or merging 505 institutions listed as insolvent. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> estimated it would cost $ 30 billion to $ 35 billion to clean up the S & amp; L mess, which is primarily centered in Southwestern states hard hit by depressed real estate and oil markets. That estimate does not include an additional 435 `` barely solvent'' institutions, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates 3,120 federally insured institutions, says the cost will be $ 21.8 billion, but <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said that projection was based on some `` extremely optimistic'' assumptions. Private analysts, who testified after <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, put the price tag as high as $ 64 billion and growing. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> called that sum, equivalent to 2.5 percent of the national debt, enormous. However, Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the committee, said the $ 64 billion estimate offered by <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, analyst, was ridiculous. `` I do n't want to minimize the problem. ... But let's not panic the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and create a self-fulfilling prophecy,'' <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> said. `` I want to keep this in perspective. ... Not one single federally insured depositor, up to the $ 100,000 limit, has lost one dime.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report comes only nine months after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized the sale of $ 10.8 billion in bonds over three years to bring in money to the insurance fund. The bonds are being paid off through a special assessment on savings institutions. Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., considered the likely successor to <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> when the committee chairman retires next January, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be ready to act again soon after the next president takes office He accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of papering over the problem, adding, `` It's clear we have a big problem here. ... I think it's getting worse, not better.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, speaking with reporters outside the hearing room, said it is too early to tell if <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> will need more money. For now, he said, the bank board has $ 4 billion in cash on hand and enough additional money coming in over the next two years. `` We do n't think we can responsibly shut down thrifts at a faster pace,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. However, most of the private analysts appearing before the committee urged swift action to stem mounting losses. Because the insurance fund needs to conserve cash, it has been keeping hundreds of money-losing institutions open, hoping to persuade private investors or healthy S & amp; Ls to take them over with federal assistance.

 Bomb experts searched the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday after a 10-day standoff between militant Sikhs and Indian security forces, and <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> gunmen reportedly killed 25 people to avenge the siege of the holy shrine. As the search for hidden explosives began, a committee of <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> elders that manages the 400-year-old temple began trying to work out ways to reopen the temple to worshipers. Police Chief K.P.S. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said workers found four bodies inside the shrine Thursday, one day after the last of the militant Sikhs emerged and surrendered to Indian authorities. `` We are still searching for dead men and arms. It may be by the weekend we can say it is all clear,'' <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said. A curfew was in effect in the temple's immediate vicinity. Residents were kept out of an area extending for 300 yards outside the walls of the sprawling complex. The temple is the center for <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> extremists who have waged a guerrilla war since 1982 for an independent Sikh homeland in the rich farming state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Sikhs are a religious minority in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> but a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Forty-five men and one woman walked out of the temple Wednesday during a cease-fire by the 2,800 policemen, commandoes and paramilitary troops posted outside. Twelve of the men, described by authorities as `` hard-core terrorists,'' were charged with murder and possession of arms. At least 46 people, mostly militant Sikhs, died in the siege, according to official statements. Four other militants committed suicide. Despite the government's success in ending the siege, its authority is still challenged by continuing Sikh attacks elsewhere in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said Sikh gunmen shot and killed 25 people across <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> in seven separate overnight attacks, raising the death toll since the start of the year to 1,088. At least 40 people were killed Tuesday and Wednesday, including 30 migrant Hindu laborers shot to death as they slept at a camp near the state capital, <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. A note found near the laborers' bodies said the killings were to avenge the siege of the Golden Temple The temple siege _ the strongest government anti-terrorist action since a 1984 army raid on the shrine _ began May 9 after Sikh extremists inside fired at police commanders on an inspection tour outside the temple. Five officers were injured. Eight hundred pilgrims and temple workers were evacuated from the temple May 10, and 146 people, including some Sikh extremists, surrendered during a cease-fire Sunday. During the surrender Wednesday, the last of the militants emerged from the temple in small groups and were taken for questioning by police.

 <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> grew up thinking he was lazy. His IQ was 156 but he could n't read, he had trouble writing and his teachers always made fun of him. He became the class clown. He obtained his high school diploma at a private school without doing any work. He forged his transcript to get into the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> but flunked out after four semesters. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> still calls himself a clown, but he's not in class anymore. On Thursday, he and two other students became the first graduates of <ORGANIZATION> Landmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's only college for dyslexics. `` This place changed my life,'' said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, a 26-year-old from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, with a beard, a quick smile and black curly hair that falls to his shoulders. `` It gave me an opportunity to get an education, to understand myself, to accomplish goals for myself. `` If I did n't come here, I do n't know where I'd be _ probably working a manual labor job somewhere,'' he said. Dyslexia is a language disability commonly known for the reversal of letters. Dyslexics also have trouble organizing their thoughts, writing them down, remembering names, taking notes and learning languages. It affects 10 percent of the population. There is no known cure for the disability, which has numbered <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> among its sufferers. Since 1971, more than 2,000 young dyslexics have attended the <ORGANIZATION> Landmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in Prides Crossing, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The affiliated college opened in September 1985, in red and white brick buildings formerly occupied by the bankrupt <ORGANIZATION> Windham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The first year, 77 students enrolled in the pre-college and college programs, the latter leading to an associate's degree in general studies. The student population has doubled. Landmark's budget is strong, it is a candidate for accreditation, and its five-year plan includes more dormitory space, a better library and a scholarship fund. `` I think things are going very well,'' President <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> said in an interview in his office Wednesday. `` We've been successful in doing what we set out to do, which is prepare students for success in non-specialized colleges.'' Landmark students have been accepted at more than 100 colleges and universities. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> said although Landmark's curricula is not very different from any other general studies college, teaching is very individualized, with a student-faculty ratio of 3-1. Students are expected to learn the same subject matter as students at other schools, but they are given more time to read texts and take exams. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> found out about Landmark through an education consultant. The other graduates, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, read articles about the program. <PERSON> Gott </PERSON>, a lanky, athletic man from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, found out he had dyslexia in high school. He thought he could cut it at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olaf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, but he quit at the end of the year. He said they had the facilities to help him but he was too embarrassed to ask. Landmark helped him stick it out in school. `` I guess the biggest thing for me is increasing my self-confidence,'' said <PERSON> Gott </PERSON>, 26, who was honored this year with two achievement awards. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, a Canadian, also praised the school for raising his self-esteem. A former computer programmer, he plans to become an astronomer. `` I probably would have gone to some community college, some low-level school, got a bachelor's degree and taken a job with computers. And that would be it,'' said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 22, who as a child often dreamed of the stars while visiting a <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> planetarium. `` Instead of setting myself up for failure, now I know what I can do.'' The cost at <ORGANIZATION> Landmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> is a prohibitive $ 20,500 a year for tuition, room and board, with limited financial aid from the institution _ a fact that upsets the graduates. `` I hate seeing this school just be here for people whose parents can afford it,'' said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, the son of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> businessman, who said he'd like to start a scholarship fund.

<HEAD>House Approves Spending $1.4 Billion on Legislative Branch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 1.4 billion legislative branch spending bill Thursday after voting a policy of zero tolerance of drug use among its employees but refusing to extend to them any civil rights protections. The bill, passed 277-104, would increase spending by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and its agencies by 1.6 percent above current levels, including a 16.5 percent hike for its leadership staffs. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected several amendments aimed at freezing or cutting costs, accepting only a symbolic $ 5 million reduction in its estimated postage costs. For the third straight day, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved an amendment requiring that no federal funds go to a workplace where drugs are used, sold or made. The provision, offered by Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa., was approved 286-98, despite complaints that it was an election-year gimmick that would n't solve the problem The amendment gives `` the impression that we've done something about drugs, but ... we wo n't have done a whit,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., who called it a `` garbage'' amendment Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., was forced to withdraw her amendment requiring <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to obey the civil rights law it imposed on the rest of the nation 24 years ago The amendment banning discrimination based on race, sex, religion, age, national origin or physical handicap was deemed out of order on the spending bill. The House bill, by tradition, does not include the allowance for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where the bill was sent. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> estimated the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> portion would add $ 413 million to the total.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday it is possible a U.S.-Soviet long-range missile treaty can be reached before he leaves office because <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might not want to wait for a new administration. While acknowledging that `` none of us really think'' such a strategic missile deal could be completed at the coming summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he did not think <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> necessarily wants to take his time. In a wide-ranging interview with foreign broadcasters, the president also maintained again that the clandestine sales of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not amount to an arms-for-hostages deal and said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should resume diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if it wants to take part in an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Asked whether he was worried about the impact on the May 29-June 2 summit of recent reports of astrological influences on White House affairs, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied: `` Well, I hope that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has heard some of the things that I have been saying about those charges, because no decision was ever made by me on the basis of astrology.'' In the question-and-answer session in the Oval Office, the president said he thought <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> should be encouraged in the reforms he is pushing in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I think it is evident that he is running into opposition, that there are those who want to cling to more of the Stalinist policies,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` If there's any way that outside nations could be helpful in this, they should,'' he said, `` because many of the reforms that he has undertaken are aimed at the things that we have always criticized in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And if there is a way to be helpful in that, certainly, to at least acknowledge our approval of what he is doing, that we should do that.'' Previewing the summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he hopes more progress can be made in the area of human rights, and that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> still has not lived up to promises made in the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords on that subject. Asked whether he thought <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might take his time on the strategic arms reduction talks in view of the few months remaining in his own administration, the president said he did n't know if the Soviet leader was ready to `` gamble that much.'' He said `` we're working as hard as we can, and it's a far more complex treaty than the INF -LRB- Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -RRB- treaty signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last December. `` We'll continue to work there at the summit if it is not completed -LRB- beforehand -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` And none of us really think that it will be. ... But I think that it is possible that we could have that, yes, while this administration is still here.'' If that does not happen, he added, `` I would hope that whoever is there and whoever is here in this office would recognize ... that a nuclear war can not be won and should not be fought.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators are working on a treaty that could slash the superpowers' arsenals of long-range missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent. The president said he thought the atmosphere for arms control had improved in recent years, in part because of the nuclear reactor accident at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. `` Possibly, in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, it was their tragic experience with <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, and to see that how an area was made unlivable for the people that had lived all their lives there,'' he said. `` And when you stop and think, that that explosion was less than the power of one single warhead.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also defended anew his decision to permit the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to elements in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during parts of 1985 and 1986, even though <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was on the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s list of terrorist nations. Those sales, and the subsequent diversion of proceeds to Nicaraguan Contra rebels, mushroomed into a major embarrassment for his administration. In the interview, the president complained that `` I've labored under a misapprehension here _ well, worldwide, I guess _ about the so-called Iran-Contra affair.'' `` We argued right in this room -LRB- Oval Office -RRB- about it,'' he said. `` Some people said, well, would that appear to be trading arms for hostages? Well, no, because we're were n't giving them ... to the kidnapers. We were doing nothing to make an advantage to them.'' `` And I've likened it to, if I had a child that was kidnaped, I do n't think that you should pay ransom,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` But if I found there was another individual that could get that child back for me in return for my doing something for him, that would be all right ... And the truth was, we got two hostages back.''

<HEAD>Scientists Debate How Dinosaurs Died, But Reach No Conclusions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> BALTIMORE </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- - Scientists presented new studies Thursday about what may have killed the dinosaurs some 60 million years ago, but leading advocates of two competing theories said neither side gained ground from the data. `` This debate is going to rage on for 50 years,'' sighed <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Orth </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at the meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The debate centers on a geologic event that occurred at what is called the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. This rock formation, laid down about 66 million years ago, marks some event that culminated in a major extinction of plants and animals. Among the creatures wiped out during, or perhaps just before, this era were the dinosaurs. In 1980, a group of scientiests at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, led by <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, proposed that the extinctions were caused by the impact on Earth of a massive meteorite. The impact, they suggested, vaporized the space boulder and threw vast amounts of fine material into the atmosphere. This material shaded the sun and caused plants to die, disrupting the food chain and wiping out hundreds of species. A competing theory proposes that the extinctions were caused by volcanic eruptions that darkened the sun. The action caused a major change in the Earth's weather, created a vast amount of acid rain and diminished the ozone layer of the atmosphere. Scientists favoring the volcano theory have proposed that the killer volcano was in what is now <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and formed a lava deposit called the Deccan, a formation that covers thousands of miles to a depth of hundreds of feet. In a paper presented to the geophysical union, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Courtillot </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said that samples of the Deccan show that it was laid down at about the time of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. This supports the contention, <PERSON> Courtillot </PERSON> said, that the volcano occurred at the time of the major extinctions. `` This is an important finding for the vulcanism side of the debate,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Officer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>. `` There are five studies now that show the Deccan formed during the time of the extinctions 64 to 69 million years ago.'' But proponents of the impact theory said the volcano studies do not explain the presence at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary of an element called iridium. This element is rare in ordinary formations, but is found in abundance at the CT boundary. Iridium also is found in abundance in meteorites. <PERSON> Courtillot </PERSON> admitted Thursday that iridium is not found in the <PERSON> Deccan </PERSON> <PERSON> Orth </PERSON>, however, said he has found an abundance of iridium at formations he studied all over the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>. In areas such as the <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the Cretaceous-Tertiary deposits have lain almost undisturbed for 66 million years. Samples show a clear, clean and significant level of iridium precisely where the <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> theory said it should be, he said. `` That iridium is not native,'' <PERSON> Orth </PERSON> said. `` It had to fall in from somewhere.'' And the most likely source is from comets or meteorites that fell to Earth 66 million years ago, he said. <PERSON> Orth </PERSON> said he first favored the volcano theory of extinction, but feels the growing body of evidence `` now favors the impact theory.'' But both sides, he said, still have fundamental flaws that can not be resolved yet. `` More study is needed,'' said <PERSON> Orth </PERSON>, `` but it's something that will be argued for many, many years.''

 Shells crashed near the Syrian-held airport highway Thursday as rival Shiite Moslem militias battled with artillery and machine guns for a 14th day despite efforts by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to end the fighting. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s chief mediator, acting Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON>, toned down his earlier public opposition to <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> military intevention to snuff out the fighting for control of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s slums. The thud of shell explosions reverberated across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the pro-Syrian Amal militia, who have been battling since May 6, accused each other of starting the duel. Shelling broke out at midafternoon and raged after nightfall. Police reported earlier that one man was killed and 10 people were wounded in daylong machine-gun clashes between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, Arabic for hope. Authorities said they had no new reports of casualties. The Syrian command said no Syrian troops or positions along the 5-mile highway that abuts the shantytowns were hit in the shelling. Thursday's casualties brought the overall toll to 244 dead and 772 injured since fighting flared in the slums, where Hezbollah-affiliated groups are believed to hold most of the 18 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said he will return to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on Friday on a mission to secure the release of the nine American hostages. He declined to go into details of his <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> trip. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said his return to the region was prompted by concern for the safety of the hostages as the fighting between Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> escalated. He also apparently is seeking <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s assurances that it will not conduct raids into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and thereby endanger the hostages. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has blamed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> for helping Palestinian guerrillas attack northern Israeli settlements. The independent <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily paper An-Nahar said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was opposing a Syrian military deployment throughout the 16-square-mile slums to quell the fighting. More than 80 percent of the estimated 250,000 residents have fled. But <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> told reporters after meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Shiite, on Thursday evening that `` if the entry of the Syrian forces to the suburbs guarantees security, we will not object.'' He said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> opposed Syrian deployment because there was some opposition in the suburbs to such a move. There was no explanation for <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON>'s change of heart. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s principal Arab ally. But the government of President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> is alarmed by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s efforts through <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> to dominate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest single sect. Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, announced a sweeping purge of the militia's military command because of its poor performance against the outnumbered <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. The communique did not say whether new commanders had been named. A police spokesman said before the shelling that the fighting had `` settled into mere exchanges of machine-gun fire'' between the Amal fighters entrenched in the district of <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> on the northern edge of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunmen in control of 90 percent of the slums. He said most of the casualties were civilians injured in Shiyah by sniper fire.

<HEAD>Writers, Producers Agree To Meet With Federal Mediator</HEAD>

 Scriptwriters and producers will meet with a federal mediator next week in an attempt to resume talks in the 11-week-old writers strike that has crippled the entertainment industry, both sides said Thursday. `` The chief negotiatiors have been exploring a possible solution to the impasse and feel a meeting at this time is in order,'' said a joint statement from the writers and producers. Both sides refused further comment. Monday's meeting would be the third such mediated session between the two sides. The last was a 20-minute meeting April 18; talks March 14 also failed to bring results. The 9,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> struck the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> on March 7 over issues of creative control and residual payments for reruns and works distributed in foreign countries. Federal mediator <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> scheduled the meeting for Monday afternoon at the alliance's Sherman Oaks headquarters. The talks come at a time when negotiating committees for the guild are believed to be on the verge of signing at least 20 contracts with independent production companies desperate to resume work. Another 60 companies are in negotiations with the guild. While the producers face the possibility of some companies resuming work while others remain idle, the writers on Wednesday sent letters to <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>, and several soap opera and other production companies seeking the names of replacement scriptwriters. The <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> letters appear to be the guild's first acknowledgement that substantial numbers of replacement writers are being hired to foil their strike. `` Your Company apparently has employed one or more persons to perform WGA-covered writing services since the strike began. The <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> is entitled under federal labor law to the name and address of each of these persons,'' says the letter signed by <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>. `` We are asking for this information for the purpose of policing our contract,'' said guild spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. The letters were sent to <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, Tri-Star, <ORGANIZATION> Viacom </ORGANIZATION>, W.F. Productions, `` Supercarrier'' producer <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> and Fox Square for `` The Late Show.'' The letter also went to <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>, which produces `` MacGyver,'' `` Star Trek _ The Next Generation,'' `` Entertainment Tonight'' and `` Naked Gun''; <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barbara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> for the soap opera `` <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>''; <ORGANIZATION> Corday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> for `` Days of Our Lives''; <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dramatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for `` The Bold and Beautiful'' and `` The Young and Restless''; Universal Pay TV Programming for `` Still The Beaver,'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, reputedly a leader of a violent Colombian drug cartel responsible for most of the cocaine imported to this country, was convicted Thursday of smuggling more than three tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The verdict capped a seven-month trial on a federal indictment charging him with taking over the island of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> to smuggle cocaine into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> from 1978 to 1980. `` This is truly a major victory in the war on drugs,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, the lead prosecutor. Authorities say <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, is a key figure in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cartel </LOCATION>, responsible for up to 80 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cocaine imports, and <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said the case threatens the cartel's operations. `` I would say they are looking over their shoulders,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said. `` I think their days are numbered.'' But <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>, said the conviction, `` sadly, means nothing at all.'' He accused the government of creating hysteria, even convincing jurors their security was threatened. He promised an appeal. <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> called the operation the world's largest drug trafficking ring. By comparison, authorities say the French Connection drug ring smuggled in about 70 pounds of heroin from 1968 to 1971. `` This conviction sends a message to the kingpins of the cartel _ you are not able to bribe, intimdate or muder your way out of custody in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> said. `` It has been a tradition in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, but not in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, Attorney General <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Serpa </PERSON> <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON> said, `` Everyone in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> was hoping for a guilty verdict.'' He declined further comment, saying only, `` I understand that he was tried in accordance with all the formalities of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. law.'' The verdict was hailed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who called it `` an excellent example of international cooperation ... against a major drug trafficker.'' <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> could face up to 150 years in prison and $ 350,000 in fines for his convictions on all 11 counts, ranging from possession of cocaine to running a continuing criminal enterprise. His co-defendant, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was convicted of one conspiracy count and faces a maximum 15-year sentence. Asked if <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> will spend the rest of his life behind bars, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said, `` I certainly hope so. That is going to be my recommendation.'' When the verdicts were read, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> looked down briefly, then stared straight ahead. Two female jurors cried, one sobbing into her hands, as their seven days of deliberations ended. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s aunt in the audience also cried and slumped down on the bench. Following the verdicts, the jury had to consider government motions seeking the forfeiture of millions of dollars of <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s property in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, including land, homes, an airstrip and planes The seven-month trial included 22 weeks of testimony from 115 government witnesses, along with mounds of documents. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year following a firefight and his arrest by the Colombian army at a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> mansion. During the trial <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> called <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> the <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of drug trafficking, the man who turned cocaine smuggling into a modern, high-tech operation, using airdrops and speed boats. Prosecutors and government witnesses described <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> as a one-time <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> street hood who put together a vast cocaine-smuggling empire after he was deported to his homeland, becoming a key figure in the Colombia-based <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. The cartel has been blamed for a wave of violence across <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, including the assassination of a former justice minister and the slaying of top <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> informant <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> `` Barry'' Seal in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. Up to 10 armed marshals were visible in court during <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial. Witnesses talked of his flamboyant personality, which included admiration for <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and slain former Beatle <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>. They said <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, after initially smuggling the drug himself and paying `` mules'' to fly between <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, earned a stake that allowed him to fly his own shipments. He allegedly paid off Bahamian Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> to look the other way while his smuggling operation took over the small island of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, a short hop from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, himself reportedly a target of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand jury investigation based in part on trial testimony, has called the allegations a `` fairy tale.'' The principal prosecution witness was <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, an ex-marine pilot running his own marijuana smuggling operation from the island. He teamed up with <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, but eventually fell out with <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s co-defendant, he said. After his arrest in 1981, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> began cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who is under federal protection and has been given a new identity, testified about hauling 1,600 kilograms of cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, and flying tons of cocaine from the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island to airstrips in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Defense attorneys <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON> hammered away at the credibility of <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and other prosecution witnesses. They accused them of making deals to avoid punishment for their own crimes, and said <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was a legitimate businessman victimized by drug investigators. The prosecution testimony was a `` litany of lies,'' <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said. In a surprise move, they presented no witnesses after the prosecution rested, sending the trial immediately to the jury. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is also under indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for his role in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. But that indictment was not included in his extradition papers, and under the U.S.-Colombia treaty in effect at the time, he apparently can not be tried on the charges. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> also is reportedly the object of a sealed indictment in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 So-called `` type A'' hepatitis, a liver disease traditionally linked to poor hygiene, is showing up more and more in outbreaks among drug abusers, federal health researchers said Thursday. Outbreaks of Hepatitis A among drug abusers have occurred in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and a variety of other locations across the country in the past two years, the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s upstate <LOCATION> Cortland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, for example, 58 percent of the hepatitis A cases last year occurred among `` known or suspected drug abusers,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Between 1982 and 1986, the percentage of hepatitis A patients admitting previous use of injectible drugs rose from 4 percent to 19 percent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s Viral Hepatitis Surveillance Program. Those statistics are not complete, since the program does not cover all cases, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researchers stressed. `` How widespread this is, we ca n't really tell,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> hepatitis specialist. `` Where there's a greater percentage of drug users, there might be a greater problem.'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> noted that health officials reporting hepatitis cases to the Atlanta-based federal agency do not routinely report patients' risk factors Hepatitis B, a blood-borne disease, has for some time been known to plague intravenous drug abusers, who can pass the disease through sharing of contaminated needles. `` But it's only newly recognized that they are a risk group for hepatitis A,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. Hepatitis A is often transmitted in cases of poor hygiene, through fecal contamination. About 25,000 cases each of hepatitis A and B were reported to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> last year. Hepatitis is a serious inflammation of the liver, causing fever and aches, which can, in rare cases, be fatal. Two explanations have been proposed for the new link between hepatitis A and drug abuse, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The illness may be spread through use of drugs contaminated with the virus. Or the virus might be spread in direct person-to-person contact, perhaps in needle sharing, sexual contact or poor personal hygiene. `` Investigations of the various outbreaks ... have not revealed clear modes of transmission,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. `` It is possible that each outbreak has multiple modes of transmission.'' In upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, in addition to the <LOCATION> Cortland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> outbreak, 87 cases of hepatitis A were reported in <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> from December 1986 to May 1987; 24 patients were injectible drug abusers, and eight more were sexual or household contacts of the drug users, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. In northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, in the wake of a food-borne hepatitis A outbreak, 33 other patients not connected to that outbreak were questioned; 24 of the 33 patients were abusers of injectible drugs. Other drug-linked outbreaks have occurred in recent years in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>`Killer Bees' Found On Ship Arriving In Florida</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL KACZOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten thousand super-agressive `` killer bees'' almost got a free ride into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> aboard a ship, state agriculture officials said Thursday. The killer bee colony, complete with queen bee, that was destroyed earlier this month aboard a freighter at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> was the third and by far the largest swarm of the deadly Africanized bees that have been found on ships arriving in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> within the last two years, officials said. There was chance that the swarm could have helped establish the killer bee problem in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but the odds were against that happening because the bees would probably have bred with their gentler cousins, officials said. The nasty little bugs, descended from South African bees that escaped from a researcher in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in 1956, attack much more agressively when riled than do ordinary honeybees. They have been blamed for several deaths of humans and livestock in the areas in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where they have taken over, and are also a threat to the commercial beekeeping industry. Some researchers fear they could spread across the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> border into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as early as the end of this year. About 10,000 bees were clustered aboard the containerized freighter <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, carrying fruit and vegetables from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, when it docked May 6 near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, said state Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>. The inspector who destroyed the swarm, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastianelli </PERSON>, was stung more than 100 times. But it takes about 2,000 stings to kill an average adult, said <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutts </PERSON>, the state's chief apiary -LRB- beehive -RRB- inspector. If they had gotten ashore, <PERSON> Bastianelli </PERSON> said, the bees could have set up a hive and begun expanding because they included a queen, the only member of a colony that can reproduce. But <PERSON> Cutts </PERSON> said a single colony is not much of a threat in itself because bees do not inbreed. A single colony would breed with European honey bees and the Africanized strain would be reduced with each generation until eventually it would be bred out of existence, he said. `` There's always a chance'' of the bees becoming established, said <PERSON> Cutts </PERSON>. `` Just what that chance is, we do n't know.'' Since 1986, signs have been posted at ports urging crews and dock workers to report swarms and its now common knowledge among seaman that authorities want to know about bee activity on ships. Also, bee-nesting lures have be placed at major ports to attract bees before they can move inland, officials said. `` They'll go to a bee box before they go anywhere else, hopefully,'' <PERSON> Bustianelli </PERSON> said. `` Once we find out there are bees there we can get them, although we might have to fight them a while.'' In late 1986, a colony of killer bees was discovered and destroyed aboard a ship docked in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Another was removed by a hobbyist beekeeper in April 1987 from a freighter in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and later destroyed by agriculture officials. The Port Everglades swarm was considerably larger than the others, <PERSON> Cutts </PERSON> said, but it was still about a fifth the size of a normal, established colony. The bees also were infested with Varroa mite, a honeybee pest detected in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> two years ago and since found in 13 other states including <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cutts </PERSON> said. Like the killer bee, the mite is considered a potential major threat to the beekeeping industry. The mite feeds on the body fluid of bees and pupae, eventually causing high bee mortality and weakening of colonies. The discovery of mites in the <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> swarm has increased suspicion the mite infestation that began two years ago was caused by an Africanized colony which became established without detection, <PERSON> Cutts </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Armenian Activist Reports Mass Gathering in Yerevan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 200,000 people gathered peacefully in a square in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> Thursday in the second large demonstration in the Armenian capital this week, an Armenian activist said. Several assemblies were held this week in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to address ethnic unrest in the republics. Armenians want the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> area of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to become part of their republic. Activist <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that some people in the crowd Thursday carried banners demanding annexation of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region. However, it was not clear who called Thursday's demonstration, or what its purpose was, he said. There were rumors it had been organized by officials, and people may have been attracted by curiosity, he said. But nothing happened in the two hours after people began to gather at 6 p.m. -LRB- 9 a.m. EDT -RRB- in a square near the city opera house, he said. `` People were standing around; there were n't any microphones,'' <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said. Police surrounded the square but did not interfere, he said. The majority of the people in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> are <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenians </ORGANIZATION>, and Armenians say they are repressed by Azeris, who are Moslems. <PERSON> Papoyan </PERSON> said there was a `` constant danger of an explosion'' of rage in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Armenians had been forced out of the city of <LOCATION> Shusha </LOCATION> in the region by other residents, and soldiers were surounding <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, he said. Other calls to officials and activists in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> did not go through. Armenians began protesting in mid-February for the annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. At the end of the month ethnic rioting broke out in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. Thirty-two people, six Azeris and 26 Armenians, were killed. The Soviet government rejected the demand to change jurisdiction over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, opting instead for an expensive program of social and economic development of the area. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissidents said about 150,000 people gathered in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Tuesday in a meeting called by the <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> committee leading the effort to annex the section of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. They said the figure of 15,000 people reported earlier by other <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissidents was wrong. The rally was called a day after the first defendant in the <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> riots was convicted of murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said protesters are demanding that trials of those accused in the rioting be open and broadcast on television. The official <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> radio said young people, intellectuals and workers attended `` crowded'' meetings Monday and Wednesday in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. They called on the government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to protect the interests of Azeris living in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, said the radio, reporting from <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The broadcasts, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, did not say how many people were involved. It said `` incidents'' took place in some residential areas of the <LOCATION> Ararat </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on May 11 that had worried some Azeris. It did not elaborate. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said there had been reports of clashes between Azeris and Armenians in the region, but that he did not have details. <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> radio said members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet met with some of those attending the meetings and urged restraint. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryabokon </PERSON>, an editor of the dissident journal Express-Khronika, said in a telephone interview that tens of thousands of people gathered in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> on Monday and Tuesday to demand that courts not give the death sentence to any of those charged in the <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> riots.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> made damaging admissions to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the Iran-Contra affair that could be used as evidence against them in court, prosecutors said Thursday. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s statement that he approved <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s plan to funnel profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels and admissions by him and <PERSON> North </PERSON> that they destroyed documents during a 1986 investigation were among numerous excerpts of congressional testimony that prosecutors said were admissible in court. Even though they testified on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> under limited grants of immunity from prosecution, former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealer <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> made statements that can be used against them when the Iran-Contra case goes to trial in federal court, the prosecution said. `` Volunteered testimony by defendants in their congressional testimony is not immunized and may be directly introduced at trial against them,'' independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in briefs filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The three defendants are accused along with retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who gave congressional testimony without an immunity grant, of conspiring to defraud the government by diverting profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. The indictment includes charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON> destroyed documents during the November 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation of the Iran-Contra affair that uncovered the diversion of arms-sale profits. It also accuses <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and North of lying to congressional committees by denying involvement in private Contra resupply efforts. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> offered to `` forego the use of congressional testimony'' to smooth the way for a quick trial as a way of satisfying defense complaints that the prosecution illegally relied on immunized statements of the defendants. However, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> cited hundreds of statements by <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> that were either voluntary or not responsive to the specific question posed by the committees and therefore not covered by the immunity grants. In a joint filing, defense lawyers called `` simply absurd'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s claim that the three defendants waived their privilege against self-incrimination during the congressional hearing. `` Each defendant claimed his privilege at the very outset and never relinquished it,'' the defense said. `` The court should flatly reject the IC's -LRB- independent counsel's -RRB- attempt to circumvent the immunity statute.'' The defense also urged the judge to dismiss the indictment on the ground that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> took insufficient steps to isolate his staff from the defendants' immunized testimony, which `` has seeped into every corner of this case.'' The statements that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> maintains are not covered by the immunity grants included <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s assertion that the diversion proposed by <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` was clearly a new aspect that I had not thought about before. To make a long story short, in the end I thought it was a very good idea ... and I personally approved it.'' `` In my view,'' <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> continued, `` it was a matter of implementation of the president's policy with regard to support for the Contras.'' <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> also admitted that he `` made a very deliberate decision not to ask the president so that I could insulate him from the decision and provide some future deniability for the president if it ever leaked out.'' The excerpts also include <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s statements that he shredded <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> documents while <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials were in the next room during the November 1986 inquiry, prosecutors said in the briefs. `` I remember shredding documents while they were in there reading documents,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> told the committee. `` Do you remember _ shredding them in their presence?'' asked <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>, counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel. `` I mean, they were sitting in my office and the shredder was right outside and I walked out and shredded documents,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> contended he could also use <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s statements that he intended to withhold information from the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and his belief that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was evasive and withheld information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I testified that I have withheld information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and with regard to Cabinet officers, I did n't withhold anything from them that they did n't want withheld from them,'' <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> told the panel. Of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> testified, `` I expected him to be evasive.'' <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> said he was sure <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s answers `` were very carefully crafted, nuanced. The total impact, I'm sure, was one of withholding information from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, meanwhile, also asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to set a trial date, arguing that defense claims that the prosecution illegally relied on compelled congressional testimony were meritless. He argued that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> should set a trial date and reserve judgment on the immunity issues until later. `` A demand for any further pre-trial hearings -LRB- by the defense -RRB- would constitute a transparent attempt at delay,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> argued.

 Conservative Republicans, spurning appeals from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders, urged colleagues on Thursday to ignore the fast approaching U.S.-Soviet summit and debate the medium-range arms reduction treaty for weeks. But Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said: `` It's our president who will be in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next week and he'd like to have this treaty. I say that as Republican leader on behalf of a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president. `` We have a special responsibility to President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty calls for the elimination of all ground-launched missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles. Shortly before <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> appealed to senators to bring any amendments they may have to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for action, Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., told his colleagues: `` We should not be playing beat the clock in our debate over the treaty. `` We can not feel rushed by the artificial deadline of next week's summit,'' <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> said. `` It should be beside the point to meet a deadline.'' Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, said: `` Let us examine this treaty carefully and let the public relations deadline in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> be damned.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is set to open May 29. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, noting that no amendments had been offered to the text of the treaty at that point, asked unanimous consent to move to the resolution of Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, the leading opponent of the treaty, objected, saying amendments were being prepared by as many as four senators. About an hour later, Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, introduced an amendment that would prevent the treaty from going into effect until the president certifies the Soviets are in compliance with all other arms control treaties. He asked for separate roll call votes on all five sections of the amendment, probably on Friday morning. `` The Soviets cheated in the past and I think we can expect they are going to cheat in the future and I think each senator ought to go on record whether he wants to condone cheating or not,'' <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> said. But Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, noted that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> testified that the treaty `` stands on its own merits and should not be linked to other arms control treaties or other issues.'' `` It would be like cutting off our nose to spite our face,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., said that linking the INF treaty to other issues `` is not in the best interest of our country. `` The INF treaty is not a favor to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` To make implementation depend on compliance with other treaties is nonsensical.'' `` To deny ourselves a national security option does not make good sense,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. `` This treaty stands on its own merits.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> conceded the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> eventually will ratify the treaty, but he urged rejection of `` the drumbeat from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and our leadership which demands our swift consent to the INF treaty.'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, raised the possibility a filibuster may have begun and said, `` I think if we were to vote tonight it would be a surprise if there were 10 no's. I think the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deserves an opportunity for this body _ before he meets in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ to say yes or no.'' Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., told him: `` I do n't think now is the time to start harping that we have to do this by a certain deadline. Wallop added: `` For us to be hurried to suit the climate of a summit is just a wrong urging at this moment.'' Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., a treaty supporter, said: `` This treaty should not be asked to bear the burden of amendments which are nothing more than thinly veiled attempts to delay its ratifications. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said hardcore arms control opponents have described the treaty unfairly. `` For some, the treaty apparently would result in apocalyptic military consequences,'' he said. `` That means we have had a steady stream of misleading, false testimony from the very military leaders we depend upon, and I do n't think that's true.'' `` We do this treaty a disservice if we treat it as something more or less than what it is, a single step back from the nuclear precipice,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` I think it is time to focus on what is in front of us instead of trying to bring in all of the non-related, non-germane elements. Although debate was sporadic, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>, D-Miss., the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s most senior member, endorsed the pact, calling it a `` small first step in the long and difficult process'' of `` reducing the likelihood of a nuclear holocaust. But <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> denounced it, saying, `` The INF treaty is a fraud, a dangerous fraud.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 91-6 Wednesday to reject the first conservative attack on the treaty. That was a point of order raised by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, who claimed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was n't authorized to sign the pact and it was therefore invalid. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told reporters on Thursday: `` The first vote would indicate the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did not think it was a serious point. I did not think it was.''

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Limits On Children's TV Advertising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee approved legislation Thursday that would require television stations to limit advertising during children's programs. The measure, approved 22-2 by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on telecommunications, is a bipartisan compromise stripped of earlier proposals to prohibit programs built around toy manufacturers' products. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation on children's TV would bar these so-called `` program-length commercials.'' The bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee would limit TV stations to no more than 10 1 @ 2 minutes of commercials per hour during children's shows on weekends and 12 minutes per hour during these programs on weekdays. It also would require the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to consider, when deciding whether to renew a station's license, whether the station complied with the advertising limits and served the educational needs of children in its overall programming. The full committee was scheduled to consider the measure next week. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> said it would not oppose the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure and predicted that no stations would have difficulty meeting the limits in the legislation.

The bill's sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said the measure makes it easier for whistleblowers to win a reprisal case and guarantees them the right to a hearing The bill `` sends a strong message to federal employees that they will not be punished for disclosing government fraud, waste and abuse,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. Thursday's approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> clears the way for consideration of the bill by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> lost up to 15,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a government official said Thursday as the first contingent of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops was arriving home from the war with Moslem guerrillas. <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosental </PERSON>, a political observer for the official Novosti press agency, told reporters that a Western estimate of 12,000 to 15,000 Soviet deaths in the army's 8 -LCB- years in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was approximately correct. It was the first time a Soviet official gave any estimate of Soviet losses in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Soviet officials have refused to specify the death toll or even the number of Soviet troops deployed there. In other developments Thursday, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s acting foreign minister implied his country will continue to help arm the anti-communist guerrillas, and <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> complained to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitors that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was sending arms to the Afghan guerrillas. The Soviet withdrawal began Sunday, in accordance with a U.N.-mediated peace accord signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The first 1,300 Soviets to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> crossed the border into <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reported that the returning soldiers sent a message to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urging him `` to use <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s prestige and your personal authority on behalf of this humane goal _ that of bringing war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to an end and to ensure that no more bombs fall, no more people die and no more children become invalids.'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said Thursday that high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Foreign ministry officials would meet with reporters next week to discuss <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rosental </PERSON> was asked at a news conference how many Soviet soldiers had died in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He reviewed various Western media assessments, including a report by Agence France-Presse that 12,000 to 15,000 Soviets had been killed. `` I think the figures cited by Agence France-Presse are more or less correct, but you can obtain more correct figures from our military men,'' <PERSON> Rosental </PERSON> said. A Soviet-inspired revolution in April 1978 brought a Marxist leadership to power in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Kremlin dispatched troops and tanks in December 1979 to help the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government fight guerrillas. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report released in December estimated the number of deaths and injuries among Soviets serving in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since 1979 to be `` at least 33,000 to 38,000,'' with at least a third of them fatalities. In addition, many soldiers died from diseases, the report said. If the death figures mentioned by <PERSON> Rosental </PERSON> are correct, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> suffered far fewer losses in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did during the Vietnam War, when about 50,000 Americans were killed or mortally wounded. <PERSON> Rosental </PERSON> rejected a reporter's suggestion that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> was abandoning an allied government still beleaguered by a nationwide insurgency. `` To withdraw troops does not mean to leave the country in the lurch,'' he said. `` We leave many cultural and economic facilities there.'' The head of the Soviet contingent in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> last week that more than $ 1 billion in bases and equipment were to be left behind for the Afghan government's use. Soviet soldiers have contended the Afghan army, estimated at 40,000 soldiers, can protect the government. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s acting foreign minister, <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, returned Thursday from a visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The official Pakistani news agency, APP, quoted him as saying that although `` the purpose of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> mission to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was of goodwill,'' his country would abide by the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord and the policy of `` symmetry.'' Under that policy, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will continue to supply the guerrillas and Afghan government forces, respectively, until one of the sides stops. `` I have been quoted as saying that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will stop all assistance to the mujahedeen -LRB- rebels -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said, according to APP. `` This is incorrect ... We will fulfill all obligations that we have taken upon -LRB- ourselves -RRB- in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord and after -LRB- the Soviet pullout -RRB- becomes operative on May 15, 1988.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is bound by the accord to stop serving as conduit for military supplies to the rebels, which mainly come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> officially denies it has ever helped ship the arms.

 A man who served three years in prison for killing one sister's boyfriend has been booked on a murder charge for fatally shooting another sister's boyfriend, authorities said Thursday. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON>, 31, said he shot <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> early Wednesday `` because he was going to fight everyone in the house.'' He said he had similar fears for his family's safety on Thanksgiving Day 1982 when he killed a man with an ax. <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> was held on a murder charge Thursday at the Pike County Jail. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> was set at $ 15,000. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 25, was dead on arrival at the hospital, killed with one 12-gauge shotgun blast to the left back, <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. The sheriff, who is no relation to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, said the dead man got into an argument with <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> sustained several knife wounds to his arm and leg. Shots were fired from a .22 caliber rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun,'' the sheriff said. <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> said his 24-year-old sister <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> had dated on and off for two years. The shooting occurred, he said, after <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> beat his sister, tried `` to take over the house'' and cut another family member so badly that he required more than 100 stitches. `` I got a gun and shot him. I wanted to stop him,'' <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> told The <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Advertiser </PERSON> in an interview published Thursday. <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> was paroled on June 2, 1986, after serving one-third of his manslaughter sentence for killing <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> said he hit Bean with an ax because <PERSON> Bean </PERSON> was beating his 35-year-old sister, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. A parole violation warrant against <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> is expected to be issued soon because he was on parole from the 10-year manslaughter sentence.

 A protege of former President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> embezzled $ 1.1 million in state money and used it to buy furs, foreign cars and crystal chandeliers for himself and his family, a newspaper said. The article about the late Interior Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchelkov </PERSON> struck another blow at the legacy of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who ruled the country for 18 years before he died in 1982. The piece by writer and juriest <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaksberg </PERSON> appeared Wednesday in the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION>. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has branded <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s rule as stagnant and corrupt. The newspaper article charged that <PERSON> Shchelkov </PERSON> was one of the most corrupt people surrounding <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s son-in-law, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, was appointed <PERSON> Shchelkov </PERSON>'s first deputy He is now under arrest and facing trial on corruption charges. Soon after taking power, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> fired <PERSON> Shchelkov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shchelkov </PERSON> died in December 1984 at age 73 and was buried without ceremony in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> cemetery. He is thought to have committed suicide because of an investigation of his affairs. <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shchelkov </PERSON> bought nine Mercedes cars for the ministry but then gave vehicles to his son, daughter and himself. Foreign cars were registered to other family members as well, the paper said. He used $ 80,000 in state money to buy 62 crystal chandeliers for himself, his friends and relatives, and had several apartments in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> neighborhoods, the paper said. <PERSON> Shchelkov </PERSON>'s personal staff included an architect, photographer, biographer, cook and other personnel, it said. He spent $ 67,000 on furs in his last three years as minister and almost $ 12,000 on perfume, the paper said. <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> said the total loss to the state from <PERSON> Shchelkov </PERSON>'s theft was $ 1.1 million, but an investigation recovered about $ 780,000 of that.

It said cause of the derailment was being investigated. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> identified three of those killed as career soldiers, indicating the other seven were draftees serving a mandatory two years in the military. The agency said none of the 16 victims being treated at military and civilian hospitals appeared to be critically hurt.

 A bomb explosion at an apartment building occupied mainly by native Melanesians injured four people Thursday in this <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory, police said. No one claimed responsiblity for the attack in suburban Montravel, outside the capital of <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>. The explosion occurred shortly before a government-appointed delegation from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> was to arrive to study the situation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. The bomb, placed on the second floor of the apartment building before dawn, caused considerable damage. Melanesians, also known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of the territory's 142,000 people. Most favor independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The rest of the inhabitants of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> are European settlers, Asians and Polynesians who, for the most part, wish to remain French. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has governed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, a former French penal colony, since 1853. On May 2, a bomb wrecked a car belonging to a European man working for the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the main separatist group. A group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> against Independence claimed responsibility. The Liberation Front condemned Thursday's bombing and said `` the more the Kanak people suffer, the more our determination will be reinforced.'' The French mission sent here was appointed by Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> and includes three high-ranking public servants and three religious leaders. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, 1,000 miles east of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, has been the scene of sporadic violence since November 1984. In April and May, Melanesian separatists raided a police station on <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> island </LOCATION>, killing four gendarmes and abducting two dozen others. On May 5, French security forces freed the hostages in a rescue operation that killed 19 Melanesian militants. Twenty-nine separatists were arrested in the incident and will be tried in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. On Thursday, police arrested <PERSON> Chanel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapoeri </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, one of the Loyalty Islands northeast of the main island. They said he was suspected of having led the attack at the police station.

 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, a non-governmental group monitoring violations of human rights, opened a 3-day meeting in this <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> capital Thursday, its first in a communist country. The executive director of the Vienna-based Federation, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagler </PERSON>, said earlier this week the gathering hoped to `` build bridges between <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> officials and local human right activists.'' The meeting was held in a local hotel without much publicity. `` We never asked for permission to meet here. The Yugoslavs are not exactly welcoming us with open arms, but they are tolerating us,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Matas </PERSON>, a Canadian lawyer from <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. A six-hour discussion was held on the human rights situation in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Among those attending the meeting were members of an unofficial human rights forum set up in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> last year to operate along with the Federation. The Yugoslavs sketched cases of what they considered human rights violations in this country _ which is communist but outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> bloc _ to about 20 to 30 fellow members of the Federation. Representatives came from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and other countries, <PERSON> Matas </PERSON> said.

He said nations in the region must find political solutions to their difficulties and the problems must be tackled from within. `` Instead of sending weapons, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should send implements for development,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said. `` But no matter how much we shout to them not to send arms, they will keep sending them as long as the other side -LRB- communist countries -RRB- keeps sending them.'' `` The problems in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are geopolitical,'' he said. `` In some countries the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intervenes and in others the socialist bloc and through them, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The archbishop is in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> attending a conference on peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He said the Roman Catholic Church has always supported `` non-intervention and the self-determination of our peoples.''

But he admitted that talks between the Salvadoran government and the guerrillas have been a `` dialogue of the deaf.'' `` The Church thinks <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> II -LRB- the agreement -RRB- is an opportunity we should not let go by,'' he said. The 65-year-old church leader criticized repression by <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> governments of political opponents, saying, `` We ca n't exclude dissidents just because of their ideas. He noted that `` death squads'' are still active in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, but less so than in the past.

<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on Thursday denied he violated ethics rules and said a watchdog group's call for an official investigation was based on `` unsubstantiated allegations.'' But a right-wing opponent of the speaker said pressure for a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> probe was increasing. Common Cause, a non-profit group which promotes tougher campaign and ethics laws, called Wednesday for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee to hire an independent counsel to examine two possible breaches of conflict-of-interest rules by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> which have been the subject of newspaper reports. In one case, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has received far above the normal percentage of royalties for a book he wrote. The publisher was a campaign supporter who received more than $ 250,000 in business from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s re-election committee in the 1985-1986 period Common Cause President <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> said the ethics committee needed to examine whether the speaker's campaign committees were at all involved in publishing or selling the book, which he said could be a violation of House or other federal conflict-of-interest rules. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on Thursday denied there was a campaign link. `` My campaign committee did not pay any amount for publishing the book, nor did it purchase any copies of the book,'' he said. He said the House rules `` clearly authorize members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to receive royalty payments of this kind.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also denied anything improper in a second issue raised by Common Cause, his efforts to help constituents, including some campaign contributors, in their dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` Nothing in the House rules prohibits a member from acting as an ombudsman for the citizens he represents _ in fact it is considered to be an important part of our job as representatives of the people,'' he said. Conservative opponents of the speaker, led by Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., have been spotlighting reports of his personal dealings But they have not formally asked the ethics committee for an investigation. If a member makes such a request, the ethics committee is required to respond. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said Thursday his plans to submit such a complaint had been delayed by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawyers examining the case, but he hoped to have it ready early next month. `` If you are going to take on the second most powerful elected official in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, you have got to have arguments that are ironclad,'' he said. The Common Cause request, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said, means the ethics committee will face an `` overwhelming burden to at least initiate an investigation'' when he makes his own request.

 A senior government minister announced Thursday that Indian troops battling Tamil rebels in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> will withdraw from the island nation. `` The government is very keen to see the Indian peacekeeping troops leave,'' the land and river development minister, <PERSON> Gamini </PERSON> <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are definitely going.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has more than 50,000 troops in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to enforce an accord designed to end the five-year war by militant Tamils fighting for a separate homeland. <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON> said the Indian troops would leave in a phased pullout, but that the date for the initial withdrawal had yet to be discussed. Official sources in the capital, <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said the matter was likely to be discussed this month when <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s defense minister, <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Pant </PERSON>, visits <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> said Pant will visit the capital May 30. Pant is also likely to discuss peace proposals with Tamil militants, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, this island nation's northern neighbor, has a large Tamil population of its own and mediated the peace accord signed last July. The accord grants some autonomy to Tamils in exchange for a surrender of weapons, but it has been rejected by the main Tamil guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>. Indian officials have been holding talks with Tamil rebel leaders to try to persuade them to accept the accord, but Tamil rebels say it does n't go far enough in giving them autonomy. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million population, They claim they are discriminated against by the majority <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>. Many Sinhalese also have rejected the peace accord on grounds it makes too many concessions to the Tamils. Sinhalese extremists have threatened to kill politicians and others who support it. A senior police official said Thursday that Sinhalese extremists killed a candidate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the central <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION> district. The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the victim as <PERSON> Jayaratna </PERSON> <PERSON> Heenbanda </PERSON>, who was going to run in provincial council elections. A 19-year-old student, <PERSON> Aruna </PERSON> <PERSON> Saman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON>, also was killed when gunmen shot at another governing party candidate, <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayakody </PERSON>, at <LOCATION> Horona </LOCATION> town, just south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Nine black police officers have quit the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> police union to protest its staunch support of a white officer fired for making racist and sexist slurs. Mayor <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>'s firing last week of Officer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, who admitted making the remarks, was criticized by the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, who said the firing was a violation of due process. The association's support of Glass in turn caused nine black officers to withdraw from the union in protest. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stull </PERSON>, an attorney for the police union, urged the mayor to reinstate Glass, but the mayor was awaiting the return next week of Public Safety Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, mayoral spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said Thursday. Then-acting police chief Col. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> reprimanded Glass last month after Glass told police investigators he made sexually and racially derogatory comments about Officer <PERSON> Vicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. The mayor's policy, however, calls for a punishment of at least 15 days suspension or possibly dismissal for such violations, said <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>. The mayor fired Glass last Friday. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said there has been no decision on whether <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> should be disciplined for not following the policy. Both <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> and Police Chief <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> McLane </PERSON> were out of town Thursday and unavailable for comment. One of the nine officers who quit the union said his decision was prompted not only by the association's backing of Glass but union president <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>'s criticism last month of a stinging manuscript on race relations by <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Maj. <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, who is black. Excerpts of the manuscript were published in The <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and sparked a flood of complaint calls to the sheriff's office. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION> is not in my best interest,'' said detective <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 32, a 10-year officer and union member for the past two years who said he supported Glass' firing. <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> met with 20 black officers for three hours Wednesday. He said the group discussed forming a minority officers' committee to address complaints, but no action was taken.

<HEAD>Catholic Schools Can Stave Off Enrollment Drop, Educator Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ninety percent of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educators and church officials surveyed believe enrollment in Catholic schools will decrease by more than half in the next 15 years, according to a survey released Thursday. Although the survey did not ask respondents why they thought enrollment would drop, one Catholic educator suggested three causes: fewer children being born, more parochial schools being closed, and new schools not opening as people move around the country. The educator, the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> secretary for education, suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education can be marketed better to draw more students. He urged parochial schools to return to incorporating the gospel and academic excellence, a sense of church and community, public service to that community, and prayer. The survey, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, was released as the weeklong <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> conference got under way Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said this was the first time 22 groups in Catholic education have met to discuss religious education problems. More than 300 people were expected to attend the conference. Among the findings in the survey were comments by a few respondents that Catholic schools were becoming elitist because of their expense and their dwindling numbers. `` Education will be in the hands of the rich because of the cost,'' wrote one respondent. <ORGANIZATION> NCEA </ORGANIZATION> member and conference chairwoman Sister <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said of the comments on elitism: `` My sense from all these folks is that we do n't want <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education to become elitist. I do n't see it as inevitable. ... `` I think a lot more things need to be done on collaboration at the parish level,'' she said. <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said schooling traditionally has been a community responsibility deserving of parish subsidy but that this attitude has faded as fewer parishoners have had children to send to school. The report surveyed 336 people representing 18 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educational organizations, including traditional parochial schools, youth ministries, adult religious education, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> universities and seminaries. They agreed or disagreed with 50 statements about the future of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education and said whether they thought the expected result was desirable. Ninety percent of the respondents predicted enrollment in <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> elementary and secondary schools would drop to slightly more than 1 million by 2007, compared with 2.9 million in 1985. More than 4,300 Catholic schools have closed since the mid-1960s. Among other responses to the questions, a majority felt it unlikely that the government will provide much financial support to church schools. And although most respondents felt that Catholic schools and parishes will cooperate with one another to broaden religious education, some felt that pastors are `` too provincial'' or that high schools `` do not value cooperation.''

 A 5-year-old schoolyard preacher and his sister were suspended again Thursday for violating school rules, while angry parents circulated a petition to stop the children's sermonizing on school grounds The children, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> and his 6-year-old sister Pepper, returned Thursday morning to <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> from their third suspension in 18 days, arriving in a car driven by their mother, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>. When they refused to go into the school, they were suspended yet again. They stood at an entrance, surrounded by a crowd of reporters, TV cameras and other schoolchildren, and waited for a cue from their 10-year-old brother, <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, who was outside the school gate. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> was suspended for 10 days last Friday for refusing to stop proselytizing and go to class. `` For God so loved the world ...,'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> called from the gate, setting off a stream of preaching from his younger brother. `` Now is the day of salvation,'' <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> cried as Pepper stood beside him holding a Bible. `` Hell has enlarged herself and opened her mouth without measure.'' `` Fools make a mock at sin,'' the younger boy shouted at Principal <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> when asked repeatedly to come inside the school. Both children were then suspended. Though she stood beside her brother, Pepper does not preach because she does n't want to, the children's father, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, has said. Officials at the school, which has an enrollment of 370, call the preaching a disruption. But the children's parents, who moved to <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> 17 months ago from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, call the suspensions an attack on their constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of religion. <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> said parents appeared increasingly disturbed by the preaching on school grounds, and were circulating a petition asking the Strodes to stop it. Some had complained that their own children were frightened by the fire-and-brimstone images conjured up by the sermons. He added that the Strode children were being suspended not for their preaching, but for remaining outside the school building when school rules require them to be inside. `` If the news media was not here and if the offers for talk shows were not present, I believe in my mind they'd be back in school,'' he said. He said if the children would agree to come to school Friday and discontinue preaching, the suspension would be dropped. <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON>, a school parent who signed the petition, said she did so because `` they're talking about demons -LRB- and -RRB- devils, and -LRB- the other children -RRB- do n't like it.'' `` I'd just as soon have my young ones home safe,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, another parent. Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said she drove her three children to school Thursday morning, but turned the car around and drove back when she caught sight of reporters and two sheriff's cars at the school. `` I send my kids to school to get an education,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` I take them to church on Sunday to get their education in church. And I do n't need some 11-year-old or whatever telling -LRB- my son -RRB- he's going to die or we're going to die and all go to hell.'' The children's father said the people who signed the petition were ungodly. `` Of course that would be the reaction,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said. `` If you're in an ungodly community, who would want preaching going on?'' As for the school officials, he said, `` They will have to answer to the Lord for kicking three children out of school. ... One day, they'll deal directly with the Lord, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Politburo To Meet Before Party Conference</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will meet in what is likely to be a key session before next month's important party conference. The official news agency said the ruling Politburo endorsed a draft program for the conference, due to open June 28, and that it would be submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and workers for consideration. A meeting of the 300-odd <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members could be held next week in conjunction with an expected session of the Supreme Soviet, which is likely to ratify the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear weapons. That would allow time for the largely formal nationwide discussion of the program before the conference opens. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say what program for the party conference was endorsed. But earlier this week a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisovolik </PERSON>, said the conference would take up proposals to limit the term of the party general secretary, the post held by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In speeches this year, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also has said the conference will consider reforms to strengthen the legal and judicial systems. He has said a full meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will be held to discuss the question of relations among the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s more than 100 ethnic groups. Politburo membership can be changed at a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum, and the conference that follows also gives <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a rare opportunity to strengthen his support on the Central Committee. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself has called for creating a system to replace aging party officials and has been especially critical of the 18-year rule of President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> as a period of stagnation and corruption. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> died in 1982. <PERSON> Lisovolik </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> section of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said proposals before the conference will call for limiting the general secretary to two or three eight-year terms Reports of a serious policy dispute between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, surfaced in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last month. Some reports said the dispute rose from the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>'s running an article in March questioning whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms had gone too far. Some commentators in the official Soviet press suggested that the article was the start of an effort by conservatives to halt <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms at the party conference.

 A man who says he is prejudiced `` against anything that is n't white'' was indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday on a charge of threatening to kill black presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, was named in all four counts of the indictment. His wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, 27, was named in three of the counts, but she was not accused of being involved in the threat on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s life. The indictment said that on or about May 10 <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> `` knowingly and willfully did threaten to kill and inflict bodily harm upon <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' The indictment charges both of the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> with possessing an AR-15 rifle that had been altered to make it fully automatic. That gun has been identified by the government as the weapon that was to be used in a plot to kill <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The pair also were charged with two counts of threatening to harm a government informant in retaliation. The indictment said the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> used intimidation and threats of physical harm on an informant `` with the intent to hinder, delay and prevent the communication of information relating to the possible commission of a federal offense.'' Prosecutors and the couple's attorneys met for several hours after the indictments issued Thursday but declined comment afterward. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' lawyer, would say only that `` They -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are scared.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a construction worker, faces a maximum penalty of three years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines on the first count. On each of the other three counts, the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> can be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $ 250,000. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Filippine </PERSON> set the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' arraignment for 9:30 a.m. Monday In an interview Wednesday at a federal detention center in <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> denied conspiring to kill <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and said that although he sympathized with white supremacists, he did not belong to any extremist group. `` I deny that there is a crime done,'' he said. `` I did not conspire with anyone to kill any presidential candidate. `` I do have prejudices ... against anything that is n't white,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. But he added regarding <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: `` If the man makes it to president, more power to him.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION>, who live in rural eastern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> with their three daughters, have been held without bond in <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION> since federal agents arrested them at their apartment Friday. The arrests were announced Tuesday. Federal agents initially said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> claimed he belonged to two violent white-supremacist groups: the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord -LRB- CSA -RRB-, and The Order. But <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Den </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouden </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office, said he had found no evidence <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> or his wife belonged to The Order or the CSA. <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, Sheriff <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruns </PERSON> said the case stemmed from an incident earlier this month, when his department received a call about a domestic argument in which a woman brandished and fired into the air what appeared to be an automatic weapon. An informer told investigators that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> not only possessed a rifle that had been converted to fire as a machine gun, but that he was also part of a plot to kill <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on June 21 or July 4, <PERSON> Bruns </PERSON> said. The sheriff said the informer led officers to a wooded area, where they found the altered AR-15 assault rifle. Federal authorities were brought into the case May 10. A <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent testified Tuesday that agents taped a conversation in which <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the informer the Covenant wanted the rifle back and was planning <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s assassination. According to a criminal complaint, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was to be killed because he `` was getting too close to being president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he had lived in a part of southern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> known for attracting members of extremist groups. He said he knew of former <ORGANIZATION> CSA </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, who is serving a federal prison sentence, and that he knew <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which spawned The Order. `` I have been raised the very same way a lot of them have been raised,'' he said, `` but I'm not part of their activities and I'm not a member of their groups. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Norris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said she spoke with her son by telephone Wednesday. She said her he told her he made up the story about the assassination plot at a drinking party and the informer believed it.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s acting foreign minister, <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, returned Thursday from a goodwill visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but indicated that this country will continue to help arm anti-communist Afghan guerrillas. A leader of insurgents fighting Afghan and retreating Soviet troops told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> his forces might concentrate on taking a provincial capital in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, minister of state for foreign affairs, returned to <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> from a three-day visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> which he was reported as saying was `` more than satisfactory.'' It was a notable restoration of harmony for two countries long at opposite sides of the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s official APP news agency quoted <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> as saying that although `` the purpose of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> mission to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was of goodwill,'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will abide by the April Geneva accord and the concept of `` symmetry.'' He was referring to the agreement signed by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> that outlined the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed they will keep supplying the guerrillas known as the mujahedeen and Afghan communist forces, respectively, until one side or the other stops. `` I have been quoted as saying that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will stop all assistance to the mujahedeen. ... This is incorrect. ... We will fulfill all obligations that we have taken upon -LRB- ourselves -RRB- in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord and after -LRB- the Soviet pullout -RRB- becoming operative on May 15, 1988,'' he was quoted as saying. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord covered four basic principles: the pace and time frame of the nine-month Soviet withdrawal, the halt of foreign interference in the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> conflict, the right of Afghans to determine their own government and the safe return of some 5 million refugees from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is bound by the accord to stop serving as conduit for mainly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military supplies to the guerrillas, known as the mujahedeen, although <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> officially denies it has ever done so. There have been confirmed reports that dozens of trucks have crossed the loosely guarded border from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with arms and ammunition for the Moslem insurgents. `` It is for those who matter -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -RRB- to stop the supply of arms to any individual faction of Afghan people,'' <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` This is a simple case as the physicians can diagnose themselves.'' <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>'s remarks indicated he reached an understanding with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Soviet-Pakistani </LOCATION> relations should improve, although <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has served as headquarters for the guerrillas fighting <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and the Soviet troops who have supported it since December 1979. The visit commemorated the 40th anniversary of <LOCATION> Soviet-Pakistani </LOCATION> relations. Moslem <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> achieved statehood in 1947 when it was partitioned from <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> under an agreement with the British empire. As <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> was speaking in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, the chairman of the seven-party muhjahedeen alliance said in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that the insurgents would begin attacking Afghan army strongholds which the muhahedeen felt they can take easily. `` We will be sure enough we can occupy and the enemy can not resist,'' <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, leader of the revolutionary <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-I-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla party, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>.

 More than 100 people from minority ethnic groups marched Thursday to demand federal protection from majority Albanians in a southern province, an official report said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the marchers represented about 50,000 people, mostly of Serbian and Montenegrin nationalities, who signed a petition. They threatened `` an organized exodus'' from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province if their efforts fail. According to official estimates, about 24,000 Serbs and Montenegrins have emigrated from the province since 1981. Many claim discrimination by ethnic Albanians who make up about 85 percent of the population in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s least developed region. In 1981, bloody riots broke out in the province, and some Albanians called for increased autonomy for <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said the petition representatives appealed in a meeting with the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Popovski </PERSON>, for an `` urgent undertaking of measures without which there is no peace, survival and freedom of the Serbian and <LOCATION> Montenegrin </LOCATION> people in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>.''

 Anger and guilt but `` no satisfying answers'' remain for the families and friends of 27 people killed in a fiery bus crash, a priest said Thursday at the funeral for three of the victims. Seven of the dead were buried Thursday, all but two at the North Hardin Memorial Gardens graveyard that abuts the high school they would have graduated from one day. Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> declared a day of mourning, with flags at half-staff throughout the state. `` The saying is trite but painfully true: They had their whole lives before them,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Craycroft </PERSON> during Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christopher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Radcliff </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Catheryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, 14; <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Voglund </PERSON>, 13, and <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheelock </PERSON>, 14. Twenty-four children and three adults were killed Saturday night when a pickup truck traveling in the wrong direction on Interstate 71 struck a church bus, rupturing its fuel tank and setting it ablaze. The crash occurred in <LOCATION> Carroll </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 100 miles northeast of this Army post town, as the bus owned by <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> church carried members of the church's youth group and their guests home from a day at the <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> amusement park north of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The driver of the truck allegedly was drunk. `` Why do bad things happen to good people? None of us can answer that question,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON> at a citywide evening memorial service. `` And if we could, it would n't take away your grief. `` I suggest that you do not blame anybody on that bus. I suggest that you do n't blame God; God did not cause this. There is sin in this world ... and there are those who make wrong choices, and innocent people pay the price.'' Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> and Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tait </PERSON>, commander of nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION>, were among dignitaries in attendance at the service in the football stadium of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Bleachers in the stadium can hold 2,400 people, and chairs were set up on the field to boost capacity to about 4,000. Rows of people crowded around the perimeters of the field. Most of those in attendance broke down during the singing of `` What a Friend We Have in Jesus'' at the start of the service, and many clasped hands and supported others during prayers. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, read letters from President and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the memorial. `` Your pain and loss is ours too,'' said the letter from the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>. `` Your countrymen are with you in prayer.'' After the ceremony, <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> and the preachers who led the service slowly made their way down a row of family members to express their sympathies. The stadium lies at the edge of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hardin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> cemetery, where five of the victims of Saturday's crash were buried earlier Thursday. The first victim to be buried was <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Earnest </PERSON>, 12, following a graveside ceremony that coincided with the Mass. The four girls attended <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, and their graves are all in the same section of North Hardin Memorial Gardens cemetery. A fifth middle-school pupil, eighth-grader <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustain </PERSON>, 14, was buried near <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, after a funeral in <LOCATION> Tyler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. And eighth-grader <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, 14, was buried in Liberty, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. Fourteen-year-old <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, credited with pushing his younger brother, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, through a window to safety as the bus burned, also was buried in the cemetery adjoining <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where he was a freshman <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> was from nearby <LOCATION> Vine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, where his funeral was held. His father, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, said survivors of the crash told him <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> could have escaped, but `` jerked away from the others, ran back and crammed <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> out a window.'' <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, 13, remained in critical condition at <LOCATION> Kosair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. `` There are no real satisfying answers,'' <PERSON> Craycroft </PERSON> said during the Mass, which drew an overflow crowd to the small brick church on a hilltop overlooking the middle school. `` We expect older people to die. ... Children in their prime do not die,'' <PERSON> Craycroft </PERSON> said. `` We may feel guilty, we may feel angry, and all of these are quite natural.'' Speakers were set up outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christopher </LOCATION> to accommodate mourners who could not be seated inside. The coffins were decked with flowers and wreaths and lined end-to-end before a flower-laden altar. The driver of the pickup, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, was in the prison unit of <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-University </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, where a spokeswoman said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s family refused to allow release of information about his condition. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> has been charged with 27 counts of murder.

 The country's leading Roman Catholic churchman rejected an appeal Thursday by <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife to ask the president to allow the ousted leader back into the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for his mother's funeral. <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said in a radio interview Friday that she and the former president were sure to go home eventually because `` we are on God's side.'' Cardinal <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, said he received a telegram from Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> `` pleading with me to voice an appeal to the government to allow former President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return to the country for the funeral of his mother.'' The cardinal said he forwarded the request without comment to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and other government officials who have `` better information.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, died May 4 at age 95. No date has been set for the funeral. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, citing national security reasons, has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return from exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. He fled there after a popular uprising toppled his 20-year government on Feb. 25, 1986. Cardinal <PERSON> Sin </PERSON> was a strong opponent of the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> government. In 1986, he appealed to his followers to go into the streets to protect soldiers who broke with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Hundreds of thousands heeded his call, triggering the uprising known here as the `` people power revolution.'' In her telegram, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said: `` I plead to you as the spiritual leader of the Filipino people to voice an appeal of a mother to allow a son, my husband, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON>, to return to his motherland and pay a final homage to his mother.'' In a telephone interview Friday with radio station DZXL, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said her husband was grieving over the death of his mother. `` The other day we thought we would have to bring him to the hospital because of the hardship and embarrassment he is experiencing,'' she said. `` In any part of the world, even a convict, a criminal, would be allowed to go out on the wish of a mother to visit her.'' `` I am sure that I and the president will go home because we are on God's side,'' she said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' supporters have staged several rallies in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> since Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>' death to demand their leader's return. On Wednesday, police used tear gas to break up about 5,000 <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> followers who were marching toward the American Embassy.

 Joining a growing number of jurists, a federal judge here on Thursday declared unconstitutional the sentencing guidelines implemented last fall for federal crimes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> ruled that the 1984 law setting up a commission appointed by the president to write the guidelines violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. The judge found that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the seven-member <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Sentencing Commission. `` The system thus departs from the basic principle that those who make or administer this nation's laws shall be accountable for their actions,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> ruled. He accused lawmakers of relinquishing their power `` to insulate <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from extended debate and political complaint.'' `` It also departs from the Constitution's requirement for clear delineations between and among the three branches of government,'' he said of the system. The judge, however, stayed his order pending <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review of the question. So far, 59 federal judges have struck down the guidelines as unconstitutional, while 31 have upheld the regulations. Public Citizen, a <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> group that is challenging the guidelines on behalf of criminal defendants, and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review a decision by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that struck down the guidelines. The petition seeks high-court review before the decision is appealed to the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The guidelines, intended to eliminate wide disparities in sentences for the same crimes, provide a complicated formula for determining prison terms for defendants convicted of federal crimes. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said he was particularly troubled by the lack of accountability for the way sentences are imposed under the guidelines, which took effect last fall for crimes committed after Nov. 1. `` No one _ criminal defendant, victim, and the public _ can know who or what branch of government is responsible for sentences that are imposed, and there is no one who can legitimately be held accountable, politically or otherwise, for sentences that may be regarded as too lenient,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> wrote. `` The simple and constitutionally tested system of allocating responsibility for crafting sentencing policy to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and for imposing individual sentences to a particular judge is essentially gone, replaced by a hodge-podge of contributions to sentencing from personnel from several different branches'' of government, he added. The commission includes three judges who are appointed by the president from a list of six federal judges submitted by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Judicial Conference. Unlike the delegation of legislative powers to regulatory agencies, `` the matters being delegated involve not the regulation of economic forces and factors but basic policy decisions of law enforcement, of criminal control and of punishment,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. The case before <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> involved a defendant convicted last month of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute. Defense attorney <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON> said that under the old sentencing rules, client <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodie </PERSON> would face a minimum imprisonment of five years. English said the guidelines would require a much longer minimum sentence but that without the probation department's report it would be impossible to predict what the regulations would prescribe.

But <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said that during <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` agreed that disinformation was counterproductive to his efforts to reduce tensions.'' <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said that later, `` following a confrontation between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, the Soviets admitted they had erred when they claimed AIDS to be a creation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> germ warfare research. Yet they continued sporadically to spread the AIDS disinformation story. After a Soviet-American meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> April 20-22 to discuss media relations, <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said `` promises were made that this disinformation would now cease.'' `` Already we have seen _ perhaps _ the first fruits of our discussions on disinformation,'' <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said. He said future Soviet actions would determine how sincere the Soviet undertakings are. In a later interview Wednesday with editors and reporters of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> cited other Soviet moves to improve U.S.-Soviet contacts. He said these included a Soviet agreement to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION>'s radio network, to cover the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit this month. He added that `` it also looks like'' <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> will be allowed to open a bureau in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Amerika,'' <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION>'s Russian-language magazine, may be allowed to increase its circulation from 14,000 to 100,000 copies <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said Soviet citizens will also be able to purchase American books by mail order at a permanent American book display in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that officials have lifted restrictions on the sale of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and West European newspapers and magazines, which will be sold at ordinary newsstands in the future. <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> also said that Soviet officials promised this month to stop interfering with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic radio broadcasting `` through Cuban transmissions.'' Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stations operating on the frequency of 1,040 kilohertz complained last year that English-language Soviet broadcasts from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> were interfering with their operations.

 <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said Wednesday U.S.-Philippines relations are on an upswing. `` I am confident our relations will continue to be strong and will be reinforced in the future,'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said after meetings with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, undersecretary of state for political affairs. Earlier, he held extensive talks with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, his official host, and met with members of congressional committees on Asian and military affairs. The meetings `` were very fruitful ... in terms of expediting delivery of military equipment and joint projects'' under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid programs, <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said. Progress also was made on plans for restoring the monument at <LOCATION> Corregidor </LOCATION>, the site of a historic struggle against the Japanese invasion of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in World War II, he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veterans' organization are to provide some of the financing for the project. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> has declined to comment on talks in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on the future of American military installations in the islands, saying the matter is being handled at another level. But he said other countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations recognize the security value of the bases to the region. However, he spoke Wednesday about his country's nuclear weapons ban that could threaten the future of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the islands. That ban is outranked by the `` higher interest'' of national security, he said in a television interview on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. Those who have sponsored a bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that would enforce the ban against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships `` do not really represent all of the security opinions in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> constitution contains a clause banning nuclear weapons but `` it is also equally true that in the same constitution that this ban should be consistent with our national interests,'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said. `` While there is a nuclear-free interest, there is to my mind a higher interest which is the national security interest, so the door is not completely closed ...'' `` After all, this is just a bill that still has to be passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and go through the complete legislative process,'' he continued. `` It's not yet the law ... it's not yet the closed door.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said enforcement of the ban would be incompatible with American policy of refusal to confirm or deny the presence of atomic weapons on particular vessels. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> request for higher payments for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is not a matter of `` just plain dollars and cents,'' but of the value of the installations to the security of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` If we are to be full partners there must be a better balance,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is very concerned about being dragged into the global responsibilities of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and it is on the basis of this recognition of each other's roles that the bases review is now being conducted.'' The secretary said he agrees with President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s policy of preventing her deposed predecessor, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, now in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, from returning to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> `` I was part of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that recommended this step and, in fact, the cabinet as a whole unanimously recommended'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' exclusion, he said. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> was scheduled Thursday to address the Council on Foreign Relations and meet with media executives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and he said was looking forward to a class reunion Friday at his alma mater, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> also planned stops in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> before leaving for <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on May 26.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Army Deserters Languish in Refugee Camps</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHANAT NIKHOM, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An estimated 500 to 600 Vietnamese army deserters languish in <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> refugee camps, largely forgotten and unwanted. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> does n't want them to stay. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> wo n't take them back, even if they wanted to go back. Western countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, for the most part refuse to resettle them as refugees, even though they maintain they are victims of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s communist system. The deserters are men who were sent to fight guerrillas opposing the Vietnamese-backed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The most are at the refugee camp here in <LOCATION> Phanat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nikhom </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, where about 430 live together in ramshackle bamboo and canvas huts, isolated from other Vietnamese who fear them as part of the communist government they fled. This rejection and the trauma of the war and their flight have created what one Western relief worker called a `` hopeless, helpless, lost subculture.'' In a camp where most refugees are preparing for new lives in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, many deserters have remained for years, deep in depression. Some have attemped suicide, officials said. Still others have turned to drugs and violence. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and now has 125,000 troops fighting 50,000 or more guerrillas. More than 1,000 Vietnamese soldiers have fled to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> since 1981, according to <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials, but desertions have decreased in more recent years, probably because the fighting no longer is near the Thai-Cambodian border, which made it easy for soldiers to desert. Some 300 deserters arrived in <LOCATION> Phanat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nikhom </LOCATION> in 1985, when thousands of Vietnamese troops overran guerrilla bases near the border, but only 80 came in 1987 and just two so far this year. The deserters, usually single males with few skills or ties abroad, are among the most difficult refugees in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to resettle. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has taken the most, nearly 150 since 1981. Two-thirds of the 76 deserters resettled last year were taken by Scandanavian nations, which traditionally accept difficult cases. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, by far the biggest resettler of Indochinese overall, has taken only about 100, largely because it considers the deserters part of an occupying army that persecuted others. Some aid officials criticize the refusal to accept more deserters as being based on political, not humanitarian, considerations. `` People do n't think of us as people who escaped the army of the communists,'' complained <PERSON> Hoang </PERSON> <PERSON> Manh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chuong </PERSON>, a 27-year-old deserter who has been here since 1984 and was rejected by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in January. `` They think we are still bad people.'' <PERSON> Chuong </PERSON> said he fled while on guard duty in August 1983, a month after arriving in western <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. He wandered into the jungle for five days with nothing to eat, following the sunset to the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border, he said. He added that <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas held him captive for two months and beat him as a suspected spy. He was then jailed in <LOCATION> Aranyaprathet </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> for 10 months before reaching <PERSON> Phanat </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikhom </PERSON>. Like several others interviewed, <PERSON> Chuong </PERSON> said he deserted because the communists persecuted his family after 1975. He said his father, a former <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> soldier, was held in political `` re-education'' camps for six years. <PERSON> Chuong </PERSON> said Vietnamese who flee to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> as boat people and get more favored treatment as refugees are rich people who can afford to pay for boat passage. The deserters, he added, are poor. <PERSON> Chuong </PERSON> said he continues to study English in hopes of getting to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but he added that many other deserters are `` too angry ... and do n't care any more.'' They get drunk and wind up in the camp jail, he said. Another deserter, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Truong </PERSON> <PERSON> Truc </PERSON>, 29, became addicted to heroin. `` I felt very sad. ... I've been in this camp a long time,'' he explained. He had been accepted by <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> but the Finns withdrew their approval after he was arrested on a charge of buying drugs from a Thai trader in January. End Adv Thurs PMs May 26

 <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fromm </PERSON>, a naval cadet with the first West German military unit ever to visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said he had mixed feelings about being here _ `` We do n't know what the reaction is going to be.'' <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biermann </PERSON>, 54, a Holocaust survivor, felt anxiety about the young sailors being on Israeli soil _ `` When I see German uniforms, I still feel a stab in my heart.'' The scene at the port of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> recently reflected the state of relations today between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on its 40th anniversary as a nation. `` If you look back on the history of the two peoples, we both have come a long way,'' said <PERSON> Aviv </PERSON> <PERSON> Shir-on </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` Relations today generally are very good.'' But both Israelis and Germans professed lingering unease when dealing with each other on a personal level, and experts say that is because neither nation has come to terms with the past. `` The Germans feel the need to forget. There is a strong current to minimize the Holocaust,'' said Professor <PERSON> Yeshayahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who produced a documentary on Israeli-German youth exchanges. `` In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the subject has been given ritual treatment in public celebrations, but it is n't discussed openly in the families, and not given enough attention in the schools.'' The unease was apparent when the West German cadet ship <PERSON> Gorch </PERSON> <PERSON> Fock </PERSON> pulled into <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> harbor in early May, with 21-year-old <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fromm </PERSON> and six other cadets shopping around warily for souvenirs and <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biermann </PERSON> feeling the stab in his heart. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> said German and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> teen-agers he filmed for the documentary became friends on a superficial level, but `` there was an undercurrent of subjects they did n't want to touch.'' When the discussion did turn to the Holocaust, hidden barriers often became visible. In <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>'s film, a German teen-ager identified as <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> summed up the attitude of many of her peers: `` The Israelis thought we should feel guilty because of what our fathers and grandfathers did. But I do n't feel guilty. I did n't do it.'' An Israeli youth responded: `` I do n't feel that <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> should feel guilty personally. But I do expect her to remember, to feel bad about it and to have the courage to ask about it.'' Writer <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, who taught high school in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> until emigrating to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1979, said German teen-agers face a difficult task because most of the older generation remained silent about the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the Germans after the war had punished the guilty, they would have washed themselves clean of this part of the history,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, 40, the daughter of Holocaust survivors. `` They should have done it for the younger generation.'' Things are better on a government-to-government level. A close network of economic, cultural and scientific ties binds them: _ Trade last year reached $ 2 billion <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> exported $ 640 million worth of goods, mainly fruit, flowers and clothes. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> exported $ 1.4 billion, including industrial machines, cars, electronics and chemical products. _ Israeli and German scientists cooperate on more than 80 projects, including cancer research, physics and solar energy _ <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sends more youth groups to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> than to any other country, and for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is second only to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in that regard As the grandchildren of Holocaust survivors reach adulthood, there are signs that many Israelis no longer reject all things German as a matter of principle. Thousands of Israelis drive German-made cars and most do n't bother to remove the hand-sized `` D'' -LRB- <LOCATION> Deutschland </LOCATION> -RRB- sticker identifying the country of origin as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> German-made washing machines and kitchen appliances are common in Israeli households. More and more Israelis are studying the German language. A travel agency in downtown <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> advertises flights to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION>, the West German airline. In the 1950s, Israelis could n't have made the trip because their passports were stamped `` Valid for all countries except <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' The Arab uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories has brought the two nations evewn closer, partly because the West Germans have not criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s reaction to it. When <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>, the president of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, visited <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> recently, he told Israeli leaders he had come to show that <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was a loyal friend, especially at a time when the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the target of international criticism

<HEAD>Fall Outlook: Law and Business Schools Are Hot, Medicine Is Not</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As college students sort out their academic and career choices for next fall, law school looks hot. So does business. But engineering, a craze five years ago, keeps sliding. Teaching, down and out since the 1970s, shapes up as next fall's comeback story Medicine and nursing continue to fall from favor. But there are hints that the sharp, decade-long enrollment slide may be slowing. College admissions counselors add it all up this way: most students still put great weight on financial prospects in making career and study choices. But social service seems to be slowly resurfacing as a goal among at least some of next fall's students. `` I see a little bit of a rise in idealism again,'' said <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admissions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Here, in brief, is what officials say is the fall outlook for half a dozen major fields of study. _ Law: The nation's 175 accredited law schools are being flooded with more than 300,000 fall applications from 75,000 students, 19 percent more than last year and the most since 1980, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admissions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Applications dropped in the mid-1980s but began recovering last fall and are now surging. At <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, applications rose 32 percent, while <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> saw a 30 percent increase. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> stopped accepting applications for its 370 openings at 5,500. `` Starting salaries in excess of $ 65,000 and $ 75,000 have not gone unnoticed,'' said <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>. What's unclear to admissions officials is whether the increase is just a blip caused by factors like the televised legal fireworks of the Iran-contra hearings and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> confirmations or the popularity of the TV drama `` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.'' _ Teaching: The national attention showered on teaching, improved starting salaries and hints of renewed idealism are pushing next fall's enrollments up A few top graduate schools like <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> report 50 percent gains in applications for next fall. More typical, however, is the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, where the number of teacher candidates next fall is expected to exceed slightly the 215 of last year, but come nowhere near the peak of 650 in the mid-1970s, according to <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maiden </PERSON>, director of student services of the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. `` The news is getting out that teaching does pay reasonably well,'' <PERSON> Maiden </PERSON> said. The national average is now $ 28,000. In addition, he said, `` I get more and more women who say, I want to be a teacher, because I see that bringing much joy in my life. I hear that weekly, and sometimes daily.'' _ Nursing: Undergraduate rolls at nursing schools dropped 21 percent from 1983-87, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 400 schools of nursing The 1987-88 school year counted 85,477 undergraduate students, down 14.5 percent from 99,923 the previous year. Only 4 percent in an annual national survey of freshman attitudes expressed interest in nursing, compared with 10.2 percent in 1974. Starting salaries are up, exceeding $ 30,000 in some cities. But nursing is still having trouble competing with other career opportunities for women. `` I do n't think the shortage is going to be resolved quickly,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON>, chairwoman of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s graduate nursing school, where next fall's freshman class will number just 30, down from about 80 in 1980. `` I think the demographics are still against us. But I think nursing will start attracting students again because service as a value is coming back a little bit,'' she said. _ Business: Despite Wall Street insider scandals and last October's market crash, business has lost little of its luster One quarter of entering college freshmen express interest in business careers, continuing a steady increase since the early 1970s. One-quarter of all bachelor's and master's degrees awarded last year were in business, far ahead of any other field, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>. But some schools report applications for next fall are not up as spectacularly as in previous years. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, director of admissions at <ORGANIZATION> NYU </ORGANIZATION>'s graduate school of business said fall applications were up 5 percent to 2,500 for her school's 360 spots. A year ago, application gains of 20 percent were commonplace at <ORGANIZATION> NYU </ORGANIZATION> and other leading schools. `` Our sense is that we will see a slow increase every year. An MBA -LRB- master's degree in business administration -RRB- is quickly becoming the equivalent of an undergraduate degree as a requirement for entry level jobs,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. She and others report that Wall Street's woes have led business majors to consider such alternatives as marketing, management and real estate. _ Medicine: The nation's 127 medical schools will receive a projected 26,700 applications for about 15,000 freshman spots, a 4.7 percent decrease from the previous year No one sees the 14-year downtrend reversing yet, but this fall's expected decline is about half that of the previous year, said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION>. Cost is probably the biggest factor. A year at a public medical school averages about $ 13,000 for residents. At private colleges, the cost typically runs $ 24,000, according to the association. Eighty-two percent of medical students graduate in debt, averaging $ 35,621, and 20 percent have debts exceeding $ 50,000. That, plus rising malpractice insurance costs and starting salaries averaging about $ 25,000, has made students think twice about medical careers. Even top schools have seen a falloff in applications since the peak year of 1979, but some report interest is picking up slightly for next fall. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lentz </PERSON>, assistant dean of admissions at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> medical school, said his school has received 2,154 applications for about 100 freshman spots, ahead of the 1,935 last year, but considerably less than the 3,261 in 1979. _ Engineering: The number of undergraduates doubled from 201,000 in 1974 to a peak of 406,000 in 1983, but the number has since tailed off to about 369,000 And the number of freshmen engineering students has likewise fallen, from 115,303 in 1982 to the current 99,238, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manpower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M, which has one of the largest engineering schools, admissions director <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lay </PERSON> said the school has admitted 2,732 students for next fall, compared with 3,566 in 1982. The decline is not necessarily unhealthy, said commission spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>. `` It's not a craze or fad anymore,'' he said. `` Interest is now reverting to people wanting an engineering career for its own sake, not just because of the economics of a given era.'' Engineering's surge five years ago was fueled by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> defense buildup and job booms in aerospace and electronics. The job market remains fairly strong, according to <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, especially for civil engineers, and first-year engineers often command salaries of $ 30,000 or more.

 <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> LeVar </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, reunited for the first time since the blockbuster 1977 miniseries `` Roots,'' predict the Christmas sequel will become a classic in itself, a kind of American answer to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' `` A Christmas Carol.'' `` I think it's very wonderful to be able to anticipate sitting down with my loved ones and watching not only the Dickens classic, but ` Roots Christmas' as well, and hopefully year after year. It has the potential be a classic,'' said <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, 31, whose career was launched by the miniseries 12 years ago. `` This is as close to <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> as we can get in an American story,'' <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> said on a break in filming on the grounds of the Hermitage, the plantation home of President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` This is ours and we should cherish it. It's our American classic.'' `` Roots'' still ranks as the highest-rated miniseries ever, and Part 8 was the third highest-rated television show in history, according to <PERSON> A.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>. The two-hour sequel, scheduled to air Dec. 11 on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, also stars <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shaun </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Learned </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulgrew </PERSON>. The story was written by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eyre </PERSON> based on an outline by <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, who grew up in the small western <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Henning </PERSON> and wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning book `` Roots'' after tracing his ancestry 200 years. In the sequel, Kunta Kinte -LRB- <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> -RRB- and Fiddler -LRB- <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> -RRB- clandestinely plan to lead a group of slaves to freedom on Christmas Eve in 1770. <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON>, who in 1982 won an Academy Award for his supporting role in `` An Officer and a Gentleman,'' said he expected a new generation to discover `` Roots'' through the sequel. `` It's a new kind of audience, the young people that maybe could n't have grasped what the show was about the first time,'' <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> said. `` It's very special, very spiritual. `` It's even better because of, I guess, the mutual growth of all of us and the growth of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> especially,'' he said. `` Twelve years ago, do you think <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would have the chance to win anybody's primary, much less running or thinking about it? The consciousness of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has evolved.'' Producer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolper </PERSON>, the son of executive producer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolper </PERSON>, said the sequel evolved from his father's idea that there were too few black Christmas shows. `` In thinking about what black kind of Christmas show he could tell, he called <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>,'' the younger <PERSON> Wolper </PERSON> said. `` And <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> said, ` Oddly enough, I've just been thinking about examining my relatives' roots at Christmas. And the two of them said, ` What a great idea, let's write a ` Roots Christmas.''' The film's budget is about $ 4 million, expensive for a two-hour television movie, said <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofronski </PERSON>, co-executive producer. In comparison, the last 12 hours of `` Roots'' cost $ 6 million, he said. `` When something has the history of ` Roots,' there's a lot at stake for the producers and actors involved to do this again,'' said <PERSON> Sofronski </PERSON>. `` We're also hoping, if we do our job right, that this will be a perennial Christmas show.'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said the quality of the script convinced him he should participate in the sequel. Before this, he said, he avoided roles similar to Kunta Kinte. `` For the first five years of my career, I did whatever I felt was necessary in order to create distance between Kunta and <PERSON> LeVar </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Five years ago, the thought of playing the character again and perhaps forever and inextricably linking <PERSON> LeVar </PERSON> and Kunta was a lot more scary. `` I do n't feel the fear so much of never being able to step out of the shadow of Kunta.'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> has shed the image in a successful new role as a member of the crew in the syndicated television series `` Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> said he was especially enthusiastic about working with <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> again. `` I'm astounded at LeVar's growth as a person and as an actor,'' he said. `` He does n't know it, I guess, but I've been learning a lot from his growth. We were pretty close before, but we're much, much, much closer now.'' `` ` Roots' was my first job,'' said <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>. `` It is not often you get an opportunity to play a character as powerful as this twice in your career.''

<HEAD>Erie's Cleaner Now, No Fires in Almost 20 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOROTHY GAST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 20 years after the <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> last caught fire, officials say <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> and its tributaries are cleaner than they have been in decades. Scores of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> beaches will be open in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> this year, and more than 25 million walleye thrive in Erie's waters. Boating has become so popular that many marinas in the <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> area are running out of dock space. A few decades ago, <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> had only three clean beaches, and fish were dying at a rapid rate. An oil slick on the <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> caught fire June 22, 1969. The dramatic improvement has been caused primarily by a decrease in phosphates and other nutrients that caused algae to flourish in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, using up oxygen and killing fish, said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, a research associate for the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Erie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. Phosphate pollution levels were decreased largely through improvement of sewage treatment plants, she said. Half the people living in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> basin live near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, including residents of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and Erie, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. Eleven million people use <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> for their drinking water, Ms. <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said Although fish now appear to be thriving in the shallowest of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said the bottom of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> and its tributaries has sediments contaminated with such materials as mercury and cancer-causing PCBs. Funding for research and cleanup on the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> has been decreasing, she said, even though contaminated sediments are a more chronic problem than phosphates. `` I hate to see people sit back and rest on their laurels,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said. `` We've really come a long way, but the toxic problem is something we really ca n't see. Some of the effects are really going to be subtle. We might have lower reproductive efficiency of walleye or darter, but we're not going to see that for a while.'' The <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which has ignited three times since 1936, remains an area of concern, along with several other <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> shipping channels, because of the pollutants that have settled on the bottom. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION>, in a 1987 report, said sediments in the <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> are tainted with PCBs, ammonia, cyanide and lead. Because of the contaminants, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> advises people not to eat catfish caught in the channel and carp caught in the open waters of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a toxicologist in the Division of Epidemiology. Catfish and carp feed on the bottom of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, she said, and tests have shown that nearly half have <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> concentrations that exceed levels recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also has issued an advisory for all fish caught in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ashtabula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ashtabula </LOCATION>, which empty into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>. There is no advisory for the <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION>. `` An advisory is just that _ an advisory,'' she said. `` We're talking about a very small incremental risk to someone who would eat this fish But what we're saying is that there are still fish exceeding the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> limit and we think people should know about this.'' But shallow <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> is cleaner than many of the Great Lakes, largely because it is is able to flush itself every 2.6 years, officials said. The flush time for some of the upper lakes, which are 1,000 feet deep, is more than a century. Ms. <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> also has more organic substances that bind up toxic materials. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wysenski </PERSON>, environmental scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s beaches generally are safer for swimming now than at any time in the past decade. He cited water quality statistics at 20 <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> beaches that show a general downward trend in fecal coliform, a bacteria that can cause flu-like symptoms or ear and eye infections. There have been no documented cases of severe illnesses caused by swimming in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> in the past decade, he said.

<TEXT>
 There's more than one way to improve the bottom line in your business or in your household account or in the trade balance of your country. In each instance you can cut your buying and spending, raise your income, or do both simultaneously. In the latest trade report, for March, the figures showed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> raising its gross exports sharply, a decidedly bullish sign for the economy. But, imports rose, too, and that gave a bearish cast to the news. Among other things, the news also created confusion in the minds of those who could n't understand why an improvement in the trade figures could lead to lower stock and bond prices, and fears of inflation and recession. Was n't this glittering news? Yes. But it was accompanied by bad news. The goods news was this: _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is able to export <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods are competitive abroad in both price and quality. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing sector, whose weakness once was exemplified by the term `` rust belt,'' has regained strength. The result: More <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobs, a strengthening manufacturing sector, a boost to an economy that for too long has been dependent on consumption and that may not be able to depend on consumers much longer. _ The turn was dramatic It was strong enough to suggest that henceforth the trade deficit would decrease gradually, thus returning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> some of the dollars left overseas for goods imported during the past 20 years. Fewer dollars overseas means less borrowing by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It also reduces <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on foreign investments in real estate, stocks and bonds. Less foreign dependence means less risk of volatility in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets. The bad news was this: Domestic consumption remains strong, as indicated by a simultaneous growth of imports. True, exports surged to an all-time high of $ 28.97 billion. But imports rose, too, although at a lesser rate, to $ 38.7 billion. It means the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still trying to have its cake, eat it and smile at the same time, which is as difficult a stunt economically as it is culinarily. Reacting almost immediately to reports of a shrinkage in the trade deficit, Wall Street was at first elated. It meant strength. Securities prices improved. Then it looked at the rise of imports, and saw trouble in the form of an overheated economy. It questioned whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could expand its foreign markets and domestic markets together without overheating. Overheating is an apt and vivid term in economics, and one of the clearest in a very foggy environment. When an economy strains to produce more than it is equipped to produce it gives off smoke in the form of inflation. There is a way out, and that is to hire more people and expand capacity. One way to expand capacity is to reopen idle factory space, but in all probability that space has remained idle because it was the least efficient. Hiring more people might help, but they are likely to be the least skilled. With American production facilities being utilized at 82.7 percent of capacity in April, highest in eight years, many economists fear that strains are appearing. If capacity has n't been reached, they claim, it soon will. At the same time, the latest civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent, considered low by most modern standards and representing a continuing decline from monthly rates above 7 percent as recently as 1986. Balancing the good news against the bad, many economists and investors felt the latter outweighed the former. They reasoned the economy was overheating and that a coolant was needed. That coolant would be higher interest rates. There are notable and vociferous exceptions to the consensus. Some economists insist the news is good on balance, but that no amount of good news will convince a nation predisposed, and for so long a time, to seek the bad. And, as you might expect, there are investors today who believe that when news is viewed so negatively it is time for them to pick up bargains.

<HEAD>Incinerator or Recycler? Company Makes Product From Hazardous
Waste</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MORGAN CITY, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> is making money and enemies at both ends of the 275-foot-long contraption he runs near this town of oil men and shrimp boats. His hazardous waste kiln at <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processors </ORGANIZATION> _ big as a football field with a smokestack 140 feet high _ is a high-profile presence on the flat southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> horizon. It's also a target of two groups that want to shut it down: some local residents who suspect it's dangerous and business competitors who accuse the company of skirting environmental regulations. Marine Shale, which employs about 240 people, denies the claims and insists that it cooperates fully with regulators. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, the debate centers on whether <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s contraption is an incinerator, which must meet one set of regulations, or a recycling plant, required to meet others. Kent charges $ 200 to $ 300 per 50-gallon drum to take in hazardous wastes from the companies that make them, ranging from glues to various petroleum by-products, but excluding PCBs, dioxins, asbestos, explosives, mercury compounds or disease-carrying materials. He receives 720 tons a day. He heats the waste to about 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit for 2 -LCB- hours while running it through a whirling kiln that looks like an elongated cement mixer. He sells the resulting aggregate as material for road beds and parking lots. He has about 10 customers so far. If <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>'s claims about its process and product are found valid by state and federal officials examining the company's operations, it could render competitors' incinerators obsolete while revolutionizing the way a growing national hazardous waste disposal problem is handled It could also be very lucrative for Marine Shale. Company attorney and vice president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> says a patent is being sought for part of the process and licensing arrangements will follow. <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> likes to say that incinerators create hazardous waste for storage in landfills, while <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> eliminates it in the creation of a product. At <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>, next to <PERSON> Bayou </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeuf </PERSON>, conveyors lift piles of various materials _ some sludgy, some solid and some that serve as their own fuel _ into a huge rotating cylinder. Cameras at both ends monitor the inside of the kiln, which looks like <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION>'s vision of hell, red hot with glowing embers and tumbling debris. A computer keeps tabs on temperature, gases and pressure, shutting down the operation if anything goes awry, according to <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON>. Earlier this year <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> gave members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> clear plastic letter openers containing a small amount of the aggregate in the handle. The public relations gimmick prompted <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON>, lobbyist for a trade group representing competitors, to write to the lawmakers and urge them to contact the Capitol's safety engineer `` to arrange for the transportation of this material to a permitted facility for proper disposal. `` Sure, we did it,'' acknowledged <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hazardous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. He contends the Marine Shale product is dangerous. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> says envy motivates the Treatment Council. He's charging less than half what his competitors do to take in hazardous waste, and then turns it into a product that sells for $ 1 a ton. `` It makes them sad,'' he says sardonically. The <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has joined South Louisianians Against Pollution, or SLAP, to fight Marine Shale. <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, head of SLAP, says she opposes <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> because she believes, admittedly without evidence, that the company may be a factor in the area's unsually high cancer rate. `` Personally, I think they're contributing to it,'' she said. SLAP and <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON>'s group have threatened a federal suit to try to halt <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>'s operations. The battle has spread to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, D-La., attacked the company in April in a subcommittee hearing, suggesting that laws might be needed to close loopholes that allow <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> to operate without an incinerator permit <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> was acting on behalf of his friend <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadhurst </PERSON>, whose law firm has represented <ORGANIZATION> Rollins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member. <PERSON> Broadhurst </PERSON> is the attorney and lobbyist who accompanied former presidential candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> on the ship `` Monkey Business'' with <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> labeled <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s suggestion ridiculous. The 140-foot emissions stack at <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> puts out a steady plume of vapor, which the company says is clean. Water used to `` scrub'' the gases of particles that might pollute the air is re-used in the process, he said. Emissions pass through a `` bag house,'' where, according to <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON>, they are filtered through more than a thousand bags, resembling vacuum cleaner bags, before release into the air. <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> stressed that none of the water from the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> process is discharged into the bayou. He cited state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> records showing that traditional incinerators, such as the one run by <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, contaminate `` scrub'' water that must be treated before it is discharged into the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a source of drinking water for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and other communities. About 1,750 companies that generate hazardous materials in 42 states ship them to <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>, according to spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> August </PERSON>. The materials are tested to ensure that they can be safely put in Marine Shale's kiln, he said.

 `` They shift wastes, they do n't treat them,'' Fortuna asserted. When <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> complains that the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> aggregate does n't meet specifications to be declared non-hazardous, <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> counters that those specifications are meant to apply to hazardous wastes _ not to a product that meets industry standards for use as road material The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has taken samples of the product regularly and so far has found no reason to stop its distribution, said a lawyer for the agency, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Neet </PERSON>. `` We're not saying the aggregate is pure,'' he said. `` What we're saying is that the aggregate does not pose an imminent or substantial endangerment to the public health or environment.'' <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON>'s group complains that <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>, by calling itself a recycler instead of an incinerator, is avoiding the stringent regulations of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. If <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> did go through the permit process under that act, <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> said, it could take three years, during which the company would have to shut down, eliminating a payroll approaching $ 10 million. That would probably shut the company down for good, he said. `` What you've got here is really an economic battle,'' observed Neet, who said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has been investigating Marine Shale for two years, partly to determine whether it should indeed be regulated as an incinerator. <PERSON> Neet </PERSON> said two federal grand juries are also looking into <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>'s operations, but he declined to give details. `` One thing to remember is that their entire facility is governed by the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act,'' he said, adding that the <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has been falsely implying that <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> is n't regulated. Indeed, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberie </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>'s air quality permit is stricter than the one issued for <ORGANIZATION> Rollins </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> plant because it was issued four years ago when the facility had to meet tougher rules than when <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>' permit was issued about 18 years ago. State and federal regulators have cited <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> for several alleged `` opacity violations,'' meaning smoke or vapor emanating from the plant was darker than it should have been. The state last month ordered <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> to install equipment for constant monitoring of its stack, and the company has announced it signed a $ 750,000 contract for such a system. Water quality on Bayou Boeuf is another concern. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Schurtz </PERSON> of the state environmental agency said it's true that Marine Shale re-uses, rather than discharges, waste water. But, he said, the agency has ordered the company to clean up oily material it believes was leaked into the bayou from a storage barge and an `` oyster bucket'' used to transfer material. The agency's order also calls for <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> to apply for a stricter water quality permit. <PERSON> Schurtz </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> must make sure rainwater that runs off the site does n't carry dangerous materials. <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> said the company will meet all requirements. Ms. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> is unconvinced. She dismisses criticism that her group is being manipulated by <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> companies that have been accused of polluting the environment. `` I'm not taking up for <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>,'' she said. `` But what does it matter what somebody else is doing? If you're wrong, it does n't matter what anybody else is doing `` My main concern is my family and the people in this community.''

 They came to <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> in the late 1960s and early 1970s as eager, young college students determined to wipe out something most of them had never experienced firsthand: rural poverty.

If they made some difference in the lives of poor people in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the volunteers also agree their own lives were changed. Then-volunteer, now-U.S. Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> called his VISTA work in the tiny community of <PERSON> Emmons </PERSON> a turning point in his life. `` After two years, I got hooked,'' said <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, who later gave up his plans for a foreign service career to serve in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and as secretary of state and governor before winning election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> <PERSON> Elkinton </PERSON>, who served in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, said the experience of recruiting `` 500 eager agents of social change'' started her on a life of community organizing. `` I was not a politically aware person at 18,'' said <PERSON> Elkinton </PERSON>, who now works for a social service agency in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>. `` But I certainly was three years later after volunteering.'' The volunteers' first hurdle was gaining acceptance. `` The poor people up the hollows accepted them pretty well, particularly once they got to know them a little bit,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, who headed <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> from 1964 through 1968. But <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> said the next step, acceptance by local officials, often failed. As long as anti-poverty workers helped repaint schools, organize recreation programs and teach nutrition classes, there was little trouble with local power brokers. But the volunteers' activism did n't stop there. To young, idealistic college students who had taken seriously President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s challenge to `` replace ... despair with opportunity,'' it soon became apparent that local politicians were often part of the problem. `` When you start fixing up a one-room school, you start wondering, ` Why did n't the local school board fix this up a long time ago?' Then you ask, ` Why are n't there books?' One step at a time, you start seeing a pattern,'' said <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinderman </PERSON>, a former volunteer who recently completed a series of radio shows about Appalachian volunteers for the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Volunteers realized Appalachian residents had little power to influence their own affairs because of unresponsive and often corrupt bureaucrats who controlled county jobs and welfare benefits. `` Organizing power groups is a scary thing for any structure that's taking advantage of people,'' <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> said. `` They -LRB- local officials -RRB- were very threatened.'' Many impoverished Appalachian residents knew well what they were up against and `` were mad about it _ strip mining, the roads, the schools, lack of jobs, the courthouse gang,'' said <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, now a hospital worker in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and an organizer of the May 29 reunion in Twin Falls State Park. <PERSON> Kinderman </PERSON> described county governments in the coal-mining regions of <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> as `` set up to do things the way the coal companies wanted it.'' <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, whose novel `` They'll Cut Off Your Project'' describes anti-poverty, anti-corruption efforts in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said the `` whole system was as corrupt as it could be.'' Elections, he said, were `` more like sporting contests. And after the election, the losing party would just say, ` They were able to buy more votes than we were.''' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said it would be hard to beat the voter turnout in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where the 1960 federal census showed 19,879 voting-age residents but county records listed 30,331 registered voters. A Fair Elections Committee, supported by anti-poverty volunteers but run by local residents, purged the voter registration books of 5,000 people who were dead or who had moved away. Still, the volunteers differ over whether their reform efforts had much longterm success. In <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> recently, more than 50 present and former public officials, among them the head of the anti-poverty program, were indicted on charges of conspiracy to subvert the free election system. But, said <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, `` That they've been indicted at all shows a change. There was a time when people did a lot and never got indicted for it. `` There was a time when getting a teaching job, getting on welfare and staying on it, even getting a job on the state highways -LRB- department -RRB- were all controlled,'' he said. `` I'd venture to say that does n't exist. At least, it's much improved. Of course, there are those who think I'm naive to say that. `` You could say we did n't make any significant changes,'' he added, `` but I think we did.'' The percentage of Appalachian households below the federally defined poverty level has dropped from 31.2 percent in 1960 to 14 percent in 1980, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The high school dropout rate among the region's 18 - to 24-year-olds has declined in the same period from 31.5 percent to 25.3 percent, the commission said But the average annual jobless rate in the region increased from 5.4 percent in 1970 to 7.4 percent last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are still terrible pockets -LRB- of unemployment -RRB- in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>,'' said commission statistician <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>. Would a new War on Poverty work today? <ORGANIZATION> VISTA </ORGANIZATION> has shrunk from a peak of 4,580 full-time volunteers in 1975 to 2,740 today. Anti-poverty programs declined mainly because of resistance from local politicians and the government's growing preoccupation with the Vietnam War, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> and other observers said. But <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogle </PERSON>, who recruited volunteers in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and now works at the <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, said more young people would volunteer today if national leaders again stressed social issues. `` I'm not being political,'' he said. `` The fact is, there has been a major reduction in these programs.'' How is the'60s and'70s volunteer effort recalled by those meant to be its beneficiaries? `` At least it provided some hope,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> of <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON>. `` People slowly but surely realized that some changes could be brought about. And it did away with the fear, the intimidation, that we had among the people. You do n't find that much anymore.'' <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrewsbury </PERSON> of Shady Spring agreed the VISTA workers helped. `` They gave us more courage than anything else,'' she said.

 Details in the deaths of the young man and woman bore chilling similarities. Both had changed their hair color _ she to black, he to yellow. Both had come to Hollywood from far away, hoping to be in the movies. Both ended up hustling on the streets. And when their young bodies were found, they were in pieces _ hers severed with surgical precision, his dismembered with a chain saw. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nute </PERSON> died 40 years apart. Miss Short, a drifter from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, became known as the `` Black Dahlia,'' but her murder in 1947 was never solved. She died at 22. <PERSON> Nute </PERSON>, a drifter from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, was killed last summer. He was 19. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Franc </PERSON>, a 57-year-old <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> university professor, was charged with first-degree murder. In the dream capital, many young runaways find only nightmares. `` It makes you wonder how many got chopped up who we just never found out about,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, a psychologist who specializes in the runaway problem for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Police and social service workers guess the young runaway population in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> numbers 1,000-5 ,000 `` If you stay out there long enough, you're going to be a victim or a suspect,'' said police Lt. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hocking </PERSON>, who is in charge of Hollywood Division detectives. Kids congregate at the famous intersection of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and Vine, where the brass stars on the Walk of Fame give tourists a glimpse of glamour. Down on <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>, the boys and girls can be found hustling `` tricks,'' despite efforts by police. They tell officers they are 18 years old but are often 15 or younger, say <PERSON> Hocking </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>. They say they can go home anytime, but they're often unwanted there. `` The real story,'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said, `` is that they usually come from a history of terrible abuse _ physical and sexual abuse.'' Their new life is little improvement. Hollow eyes, scabs and roughened skin are signs of drug and alcohol abuse and chronic malnutrition. Sleeping in abandoned buildings called `` squats,'' the children often fall victim to pimps, drug dealers and ex-convicts who, like <PERSON> Fagin </PERSON> in `` Oliver Twist,'' need young prey. `` A lot of pedophiles live in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who founded Children of the Night in 1979. `` It's like they all moved here when they heard this is where the kids are.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s agency is a non-profit volunteer group that helps young people escape the streets. Her volunteers help about 100 children a month, almost all of whom have fallen into prostitution. Ms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> believes otherwise inexplicable deaths are tied to the pimps. She described a diabetic girl who died in a hotel room. `` She was locked in her room without her medicine.'' Many of the street children are middle-class youngsters running from homes in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburbs. But <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> keeps records on cases from 47 states. `` There has always been a draw to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This is n't like <LOCATION> Haight-Ashbury </LOCATION> in the'60s, though. Those young people were college-age. They were rebelling against their parents. These kids in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> are much younger. They've been rejected by their parents.'' With no place to belong, the new arrivals in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> turn to older people who will feed them first, then degrade them, Ms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` Their parents say they ca n't come home. ... In a sad way, with prostitution, they've got job security.'' For those not yet tied to a pimp, life is hand-to-mouth. So they seek security with the pack, <PERSON> Hocking </PERSON> said. They steal to survive. `` Some of them, girls as well as boys, shave their heads so the pimps wo n't want them,'' <PERSON> Hocking </PERSON> said. `` Everyone rips them off, so they hang together.'' In the squats, which are often covered with satanic grafitti, they listen to `` heavy metal'' tapes on pilfered cassette players. `` It's sex and drugs and rock' n' roll,'' <PERSON> Hocking </PERSON> said. `` But I have n't met one who wants to stay on the street.'' At the storefront office of Children of the Night, an 18-year-old girl calling herself <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> stopped in and said she did n't know where she was going to stay. The squat she had stayed in the night before was set afire by someone looking for a girl named `` Star,'' she said. `` He says he'll keep burning places down until he finds Star.'' <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> said she'd like to be a model and that she left home because her father tried to rape her. She said she met a `` sweet boy'' who gave her a gold ring. The `` boy'' is about twice her age. Another girl at Children of the Night said that during her years on the street, she lived with older drug-dealer boyfriends until she joined an out-call prostitution ring. The adults in the ring moved her into an apartment. `` They gave me my food. They washed my clothes and gave me an I.D.,'' said the girl who called herself <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON>. `` I hung out for a couple of months until I got sick of it.'' <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> says she is off the streets and going to school. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hocking </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> say young people can be rescued. Each cited success stories of kids who returned to school or got jobs. But many will never return home because the home was unsuitable. `` We need programs that get them out of the law enforcement system and into the social service system,'' <PERSON> Hocking </PERSON> said, calling for shelters that offer refuge, hygiene and counseling. In 1983, Ms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and police discovered dozens of street kids in the biggest squat of them all, a crumbling apartment they called `` Hotel Hell.'' Next door to the famed Chinese Theater, the building was once home to comedian <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> and other celebrities. `` We found evidence of everything there. There was disease, malnutrition, drug abuse. Some kids were shooting whiskey in their veins for a cheap high,'' said <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, who gathered medical histories on the youngsters evacuated from the fire trap on <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> lawmakers toured `` Hotel Hell'' and legislation followed to fund a program called Project Homeless Youth, supervised by Children's Hospital. The 20 shelter beds are constantly filled and many young people must be turned away. The ones who opt for counseling and intervention at the shelter often get away from the exploitation of the streets, <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said. `` They need an adult they can trust and a situation where there is no manipulation,'' said <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who hopes to raise enough money to start a shelter run by Children of the Night. `` We have to try to get them to somewhere where somebody gives a damn about them,'' <PERSON> Hocking </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bush Wants to Be `Education President' But Offers Few Specifics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Everywhere he goes, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talks about wanting to be `` the education president,'' singling it out as one area he would emphasize more than President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee-in-waiting has offered few specifics on how he would carry out that mission, apart from proposing a new tax break for college savings accounts and promising to support the Head Start program for disadvantaged children. At a recent campaign stop in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, pressed to explain how a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would handle education differently, the vice president said he would bring outstanding school teachers to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for recognition ceremonies. He also called for restoration of `` the four R's: reading, ` riting, ` rithemetic and respect But those are precisely the kinds of bully pulpit efforts that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his secretary of education, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, have specialized in. School recognition programs are already a regular Rose Garden feature, blossoming in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years even while the president sought to slash the education budget. Former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> identifies as one his education advisers, said in an interview, `` I think he's not yet spelled out his views in a number of areas and I'm looking forward to his doing that. The former governor, who launched a 10-point program in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> that included a controversial, ground-breaking career-ladder plan for teachers, said he expects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will `` put education right up there with peace and prosperity as a concern of his administration. ... If he carries through with that for eight years, he will have a massive effect on how Americans value and view education.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said the next president should look `` for ways to help communities make schools better, including helping to pay the bill.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> activists at a fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, last month, `` I do n't want to have the federal government come in and tell the superintendents in these schools, ` Here's your curriculum. Here are the A, B's and C's and you got to follow it.' ... But I do want to see the federal government used to put more emphasis on excellence.'' Pressed to spell out what he meant, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I want to build on education, add to the concept of an education president. Because as I look at our ability, and some would say inability, to compete, the answer is education. ... It's not going to be a radical philosophical change; it's going to be a question of emphasis.'' `` It wo n't be turning my back on a record that I have identified with,'' he added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently visited <ORGANIZATION> Garfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the barrio of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where scores of Hispanic students have won honors in calculus under the tutelage of prize-winning teacher <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>. A new movie, `` Stand and Deliver,'' celebrates <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>'s success story. When one of <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>'s pupils asked the vice president if money would be available to help them attend college, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` I think the federal government has a responsibility _ there will be a change of priorities to some degree'' under his administration. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` The problem is there is always going to be a limitation in what the federal government can do. In this country, if you can afford to pay for a kid's education, you should do it.'' In <LOCATION> Vandalia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, when a <ORGANIZATION> Butler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> student asked how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would help public schools in financial trouble, he replied: `` The federal government should not create increased funding for the public schools. That's not the function of the federal government the way I see it,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a product of prep schools and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, supports tuition tax credits for private-school parents, but has not made clear whether he would seek, as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did, vouchers that poor parents could spend on public or private education. He told the students in <LOCATION> Vandalia </LOCATION>, `` I like the idea of trying to get as much competition going between the schools as possible. ... I would n't want to do anything to weaken the public school system, although I think we should have the challenge and diversity that we've got in the way of private schools and parochial schools.'' Elsewhere, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said the federal government pays 7 percent of schools' bills and `` that's about right.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which tracks school finance, contends the federal share of public elementary and secondary expenditures has dropped during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration from 9.2 percent to 6.2 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said, `` I love the concept of Head Start,'' the $ 1.2 billion preschool program for disadvantaged children. Although Head Start was included in the 1982 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` safety net,'' it serves only 445,000 children, or 16 percent of those eligible, according to the Children's Defense Fund. The government's biggest school aid program, the $ 4.5 billion Chapter 1 remedial program for the disadvantaged, reaches nearly 5 million children, but still only half those who need it. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> twice sought to cut the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> budget by $ 5 billion. The only increases he proposed were in election years: 1984 and 1988. In his first term, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought deep cuts in Chapter 1 as well as aid for teaching the handicapped, bilingual education and help for college students. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, nevertheless, has boosted the education budget to more than $ 21 billion from less than $ 15 billion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also speaks frequently about his desire to `` strengthen student aid for those that need it,'' including loans for college, <ORGANIZATION> Pell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grants </ORGANIZATION> and the college work-study program. But he will have to reconcile those intentions with another promise: his plan to seek a modified four-year freeze on the federal budget, with the exception of Social Security, that would allow spending to rise no more than 4 percent a year. Education accounts for only a tiny portion of the trillion-dollar federal budget, but most school programs fall into the category of discretionary spending where the pressure from a freeze would be greatest. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says with disdain that, `` The liberals, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, their answer is, ` Hey, if you really believe in education, double the spending' ... I'm going to be saying, ` Great. How are you going to pay for it and why is it better to have it dictated from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>?''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, has been a longtime activist in the fight against adult illiteracy, and he frequently tells audiences that 13 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 17-year-olds are functionally illiterate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> often extols public-private sector partnerships as a tool in the fight against illiteracy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he is also getting education advice from <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> founder who headed a federal panel that called two years ago for more federal support for university researh. After a recent tour of coal research facilities at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` The people working in research institutions around this nation ... pushing back the frontiers of human understanding will have more of an impact on the 21st century than all of us down in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>.''

 Like millions of abandoned children in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arcanjo </PERSON> lived on the streets, stealing and begging. He faced an adulthood of misery and crime. But late last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> persuaded him that he could be more than a beggar or a thief, and today the 15-year-old street kid is learning to be a carpenter with the guarantee of a job when he finishes. <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> is one of about 9,000 children being helped in a new program praised by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- as `` unique, creative and forward looking.'' `` Our basic aim is to provide alternative educational and job training programs that will give the abandoned child the self-respect he never had and detour him from the path that usually leads to a life of crime,'' said <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. To achieve her objective, <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> created a multi-approach program that includes boarding houses where the children receive medical and dental care and are fed and clothed. After a process of adaptation in which they overcome `` the fears, hatred and skepticism caused by years of abandonment,'' the children are placed in schools or sent to vocational training centers. One of the most innovative parts of the program is its job-training project in which children learn a trade of their choosing at one of several companies owned and operated by the state of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON>, for instance, is learning carpentry at the <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s Supply, Maintenance and Operations Center. Other children learn how to become computer programmers, printers, electricians and auto mechanics. At the end of the six-month program, each child is guaranteed a full-time job. Since May 1987, when the project was created, 258 children have learned a trade and been hired; 1,177 others are now being trained. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> said one reason for the success of the program is that it involves `` no coercion or locking up.'' `` It has been proven that forcing children to do what they do n't want to do and locking them away in detention centers does not work,'' she said in an interview `` They are worse off and more violent when they leave than when they go in.'' She described the state's juvenile detention centers as `` repressive places where children lose all their self-esteem.'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Melo </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state foundation that runs the centers, said, `` Of the 2,500 children currently detained only a small minority can be considered dangerous. Most are there because of vagrancy or because of some petty crime like purse-snatching.'' <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> said eventually her program would expand `` so that one day the detention centers will be empty of all but the most dangerous individuals who have committed crimes like murder or rape.'' To take part in her program `` a child must decide for himself that he wants to be helped and of course we help him reach this decision,'' <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> said. The first contact a child has with the program is through one of the 120 `` street educators'' _ psychologists, sociologists, social workers, lawyers and other professionals who look for abandoned children and win their friendship and trust. When that relationship is established, a process that could take several months, the street educator introduces the child to the program and guides him through its initial phases. <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> said, `` For years I lived on the streets begging and stealing or shining shoes or selling candies in the subway. `` A street educator once approached me and told me about the program, but I did n't trust her. I thought she wanted to lock me away somewhere.'' Then <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> was arrested for vagrancy and police planned to send him to a juvenile detention center. But, the street educator intervened out `` and that's when I decided to give the program a try,'' <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> said. `` It was the best decision I have ever made.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>'s representative in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, called the program `` one of the most coherant and complete efforts at dealing with abandoned children.'' He said it was unique because `` it simultaneously reduces the number of street children and prevents others from taking to the streets to survive.'' He said it should serve as a model for other Brazilian cities and other countries. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> estimates the number of abandoned children in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> at 7 million. They are among 36 million who lack education, health care, housing and parental guidance and affection. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> said one of the basic reasons for the large number of street children `` is society's abandonment of adults who are exploited by low wages and who therefore can not properly care for their children.'' Most Brazilian workers earn the equivalent of about $ 125 a month. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> also cited a poorly structured public school system `` that excludes the poor.'' `` There may be enough classrooms and teachers, but the poor can not send their children to school simply because they ca n't pay for supplies and uniforms,'' she said. `` Most street children start off begging for food. Little by little they start committing petty thefts and as they grow older they start stealing cars or pushing drugs. So, from innocent vcitims of society's injustices, they end up the aggressors.'' One 17-year-old street kid, identifying himself only as <PERSON> Beto </PERSON>, is one a group of 12 boys 11 to 18 years old who hang out in a large square in front of the Roman Catholic cathedral. `` We prefer to earn our living by either asking people for money or selling things,'' he said `` but when the money is short and hunger sets in, then of course we are going to steal.'' When they are not stealing, begging or selling, they sleep on benches or under store awnings or theater marquees. They bathe and wash their clothes in public fountains. No official figures have been compiled on the number of crimes committed by street children, said <PERSON> Jairo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pires </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest who has worked with poor children in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for more than 25 years, said children often are exploited by adults `` for whom a street kid is a useful instrument to commit crimes.'' `` It is a grownup who buys the watches, bracelets and necklaces stolen by a child,'' he added. `` It is a grownup who drives away the car first broken into by a kid, and it is a grownup who uses children as messengers in drug transactions. `` And most of this kind of exploitation is usually done by adults who were once street children themselves.''

 When <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as president needed to get away for a while before he went to Camp David with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> and Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, his thoughts turned to fly fishing. `` When I was president, <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON> and I fly fished out West,'' he says. On the pre-Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON> trip, `` I took along with me the briefing books that I would be using to prepare myself for the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> negotiations, so it was a combination of delightful surroundings, good companions ... and also just clearing my mind when I was ready to embark on one of the major challenges of my presidency.'' He now fly fishes throughout the world, but loves to come home to north <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to the little log cabin he furnished with his handmade wooden furniture. `` The cabin is within 20 feet of <LOCATION> Turnip </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, which has a fairly good native population of rainbow trout. It's the perfect environment for writing in placid, beautiful surroundings, in almost total isolation. When <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON> and I are there, which is never enough, it makes for good thoughts and productive days.'' The former president has written a new book, `` An Outdoor Journal: Reflections and Adventures,'' recalling favorite fishing experiences. Writing it, he said, was `` a labor of love.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>: `` I bet I was the only American in World War II who parachuted into Occupied <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with a fly rod. I used it, too.'' The son of legendary fisherman and writer <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> now lives in <LOCATION> Ketchum </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, between angling excursions to distant parts of the globe. But some of his most vivid memories are of his happy days on clear rivers with his father. `` When I was 6, before I'd ever picked up a fly rod, I spent one whole summer watching him fish the <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s Fork River of the Yellowstone,'' <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> says. `` Finally, at the very end, when I'd spent the whole summer building up the need to fish, my father taught me how to cast. Author of `` Misadventures of a Fly Fisherman,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> says his love for the sport has lasted throughout his life. Not so for his late father. `` Dad had a big nice trunk, outfitted with all his rods and reels and tackle, everything he had collected over his years of fly fishing,'' remembers <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>. `` Right after that wonderful summer on the <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s Fork, in the fall of 1939, he had the trunk shipped by railway express, and they lost it. He never trout fished again. I think it was as if he felt he'd have to start all over again and it just was n't worth the trouble.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>: `` I took my wife fishing on our honeymoon and she has n't been since,'' says the former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> now teaches at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and is chairman of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banking firm. When he resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> last year, he said he planned to go fishing. `` I went maybe eight times last summer, I ought to be doing more,'' says <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, who's cast for trout in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. `` You're out with nature and all that stuff. It's nice to be more or less alone, testing your wits and skill But I'm a real amateur. In the winter, he ties his own flies at his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> home and plots a warm weather assault on distant rivers, perhaps in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. `` From now on I'm going to grab fishing whenever I can get it.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgens </PERSON>: `` On the first date with my future husband my train into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was late, so he occupied his time by going to <ORGANIZATION> Abercrombie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> and buying some artificial flies. He was very surprised when he showed them to me and I started identifying them. Our mutual enthusiasm for fly fishing was certainly a plus.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Morgens </PERSON> is a veteran member of Trout Unlimited's board of directors and chairs the nominating committee. `` Both my parents were fishermen _ my mother once held a blue marlin record _ and since I was an only child I spent a lot of time doing male sort of things with them. I grew up before the women's lib thing, so fishing taught me how to do things on my own, taught me I could go off alone without needing any help In those days there were n't that many things which could teach women to be independent, but fly fishing was one of them.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Morgens </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Ned </PERSON>, live in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gowdy </PERSON>, who for 20 years hosted The American Sportsman on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>: `` When we'd go fishing, my dad would say, ` <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, remember the buffalo There were millions of them before the white man wiped them out for money. That could happen to trout, too.' So from the very beginning, when I learned to fly fish at the age of 8, I was always a catch-and-release fisherman.'' He fishes almost everywhere now, and wherever he goes he preaches conservation. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Piotrowski </PERSON>, commander in chief of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, puts in crowded workdays in his <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> headquarters, `` but sometimes in the evenings I can slip away, up into the mountains, and fly fish. `` I always like to match wits with a trout. It's great when you win, but the alternative is n't desirable. It's very humbling to come home empty-handed.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the interior, is partial to fishing in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, but spends more time fishing on the East Coast. `` Before I was working and got married and had kids I went fly fishing 40 or 50 times a year,'' he says. `` Now I'm lucky if I go 15 times a year. But I dream about it a lot.'' `` I like companions who have the same appreciation for the sport's traditions and ethics as I do, and who provide just enough subtle competition on the stream to make it intriguing.''

 Fine craftsmanship, the kind expected of a classic, is part of the aura of the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 90. It's in the impeccable stitching of the leather along the door interiors and on the seats. It's in the understated cockpit design of this new, downsized <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>. It's in the stable, firm ride and the smooth shifting of the five-speed manual transmission. You would n't guess that the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 90 _ along with its companion vehicle the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 80 _ are the first new cars that <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> has introduced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1983. They seem to be so well-honed that one might think they have been around for years. And sadly, you would n't know by the sales figures either that they are impressive new competitors in the European luxury car market. Hindered by publicity of complaints that the larger, <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 cars have suddenly accelerated out of control on some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drivers, the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 80 and 90 autos have not been selling as well here as had been hoped. While the company had expected up to 28,000 sales annually, it now looks for maybe 8,000 <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 90 sales and another 8,000 <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 80 sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the current model year, a company spokeswoman said. There are no projections for the 1989 model year, she added. The federal government, by the way, continues to monitor sudden acceleration complaints on the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000s. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> has installed shift locks on the cars which require that the brake be depressed before the vehicle can be shifted out of park. The Audi 80-90 series is a replacement for the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 4000 line and is not directly part of that controversy, but some consumers seem to be shunning <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> nameplates altogether. That's unfortunate, because the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 90 test car was admirable in many respects. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> engineers thought ahead in their installation of the anti-lock braking system. Unlike many other European luxury cars, the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 90 allows drivers to turn the ABS off with a switch on the dashboard. That might be needed, for example, on gravel roads where a buildup of dirt and stone ahead of the tires could help a driver slow down or stop. Anti-lock brakes, which prevent wheels from locking, would n't necessarily allow that to happen <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> engineering also was evident in the sleek, aerodynamic shape. The Audi 90's drag coefficient, which indicates how easily it cuts through air with little resistance, was low, thanks to a raked windshield, flush window glass, aerodynamic headlights and door handles that are integrated into the car body. Such aerodynamics are designed to reduce wind noise and reduce driver and passenger fatigue. The Audi 90's new, five-speed transmission was flawless and smooth. The engine _ a 2.3-liter, fuel-injected, in-line five-cylinder _ could produce up to 130 horsepower, was steady and performed well. The white paint outside was a special pearlescent metallic that really shone. Leather seats _ the front ones were heated at an optional $ 225 _ were comfortable. Rear leg room ranged from acceptable to roomy, depending on the location of the front seats. There were fasteners to keep the floor mats in place, and there were child-roof rear door locks, as well as a feature that locked the rear windows and turned off the rear cigarette lighter from a switch on the driver door. The center arm rest in the front adjusted to different heights _ nice for different drivers. A vehicle monitoring system was engineered with two types of warning signals: red if some systems were in really bad shape and needed immediate attention and yellow if corrections needed to be made soon. My biggest concern was the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 90 trunk. It did not go back very far and seemed small. But that's a small complaint for a small car that packages superbly some wonderful, luxury car features from its bigger rivals. In sum, the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 90 test car was solid and conveyed the casual elegance of a classic, inside and out. Base price for the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 90 is $ 24,330, putting it in the ballpark of such competitors as the BMW 325, which starts at around $ 24,000, and the Mercedes-enz 190E, which starts at more than $ 29,000. Target buyers of the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 80-90 cars are mostly male, most mostly married, mostly college graduates, between 35 and 44 with median family income of $ 68,900, the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. Because the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 90 is a new vehicle, there are no reliability reports.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> has terminated its consideration of the possible acquisition of certain <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multifoods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> business units, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multifoods </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The company said it had received a letter from <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> ending its consideration, and that the letter effectively terminated a standstill agreement between <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multifoods </ORGANIZATION> and the group. <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> had agreed not to purchase additional <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multifoods </ORGANIZATION> shares during talks between the two. It was not immediately clear whether <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' letter was an indication the group was renewing its consideration of an acquisition of the entire company. Company spokespeople could not immediately be reached for further comment. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multifoods </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 12 -LCB- cents to $ 26.12 -LCB- a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The letter was disclosed after the market closed. <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which consists mainly of the <PERSON> Bregman </PERSON> baking family of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON> banking family of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, said last year it might seek control of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multifoods </ORGANIZATION>, an international food manufacturer and distributor. The company said it would oppose any takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, and in October filed suit alleging that the partnership had illegally caused speculation in its stock and filed misleading government disclosure statements. <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> disclosed in a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing in December that it held 10.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multifoods </ORGANIZATION>' outstanding common stock. Earlier, it had sought federal government clearance to raise its stake to as high as 25 percent. The filing said the partnership had held discussions with <PERSON> Multifoods </PERSON>' financial adviser about the `` possibility of entering into negotiations'' to buy certain assets of the company. But `` no negotiations were held and no agreement or understanding was reached'' during the discussions, the filing said.

<HEAD>Rate Concerns Depress Stocks, Single-Family Housing Construction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Concerns about rising interest rates are depressing the stock market and the single-family home segment of the construction market, analysts say. On Wall Street, stock prices slumped Wednesday for the second consecutive session, sending one widely-watched market indicator to a three-month low. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 35.32 to 1,951.09, the lowest level since it closed at 1,914.46 on Feb. 9. Broader market measures also tumbled. Bond prices fell broadly, pushing interest rates higher. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond, regarded as an indicator of interest rate speculation, rose to 9.29 percent from 9.21 percent late Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said single-family home building dropped 6.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.10 million units last month. Construction of multi-family units, which swing widely from month to month, soared by 23.3 percent to a rate of 466,000 units. Overall, housing construction rose 0.5 percent in April to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.56 million units, following gains of 2.3 percent in March and 9.9 percent in February, the report stated. But housing activity was still 4.5 percent below last year. Economists said the increase in apartment building probably was an aberration and rising mortgage interest rates likely would depress single-family construction. `` The single-family number is not a bad number, but I think it's an indication that as rates rise through the year, it's going to impact the housing market,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> A Regalia, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages were just under 10 percent through March, but began edging up in April and averaged 10.4 percent last week. Housing permits, considered a good sign of future construction activity, fell 4.1 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million units.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil futures prices have slipped in the wake of an industry report showing buildups of crude and heating oil inventories, and weaker-than-expected demand for gasoline, analysts say. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, fell 33 cents to settle at $ 17.43 per barrel Wednesday. Among June contracts for refined products, wholesale prices for unleaded gasoline fell 0.51 cent to 52.23 cents per gallon, while heating oil fell 0.71 cent to 47.07 cents per gallon. The declines followed Tuesday night's release of a report on the status of domestic production and supplies for the week ended Friday by the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, senior broker and analyst at <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the report's indication that stocks of heating oil were up by more than 3 million barrels, and crude stocks were up by 1.6 million barrels were negative for the market. Increased supplies amid stable or shrinking demand put downward pressure on prices. <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> also said an assessment of gasoline production and imports, together with changes in inventories over the last four weeks, indicated a 5.7 percent decline in gasoline consumption, compared with the same period last year. `` That flies in the face of all the talk about booming demand,'' he said. `` We have n't seen that pre-Memorial Day surge in demand for gasoline yet.''

 Wall Street has propelled <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> common stock above the $ 64-a-share price suggested in a $ 1.5 billion buyout proposal from a group led by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, indicating invsetors expect a higher bid is expected. <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, meanwhile, told the company's shareholders at their annual meeting Wednesday that the publishing and information services concern is n't for sale. Securities analysts speculated the Bass proposal could attract others, possibly foreign companies, to become involved, touching off a bidding war. <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> stock soared $ 18.25 a share to close at $ 68.87 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after trading as high as $ 71.62 -LCB- earlier in the day. Some analysts have speculated the company could sell for as much as $ 85 to $ 90 a share in a bidding contest. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON>, a publishing analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, estimated <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> could command a price of $ 90 a share or more based on prices paid for other publishing companies in recent months. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who follows <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> for H.G. <ORGANIZATION> Wellington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he doubted the Bass group expected to be able to buy <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> for $ 64 a share. `` I suspect it was a manuever to encourage others to buy at a higher price,'' he said. The Bass group owns about 2.4 million <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> shares, or about 9.1 percent of the company's 26 million common shares outstanding. The analysts said foreign-based buyers, benefitting from the decline in the dollar that has boosted their own buying power, have shown an avid interest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publishing companies. French media giant <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> recently agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Addison-Wesley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>.

He said management was confident about <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s growth potential, and added: `` This is why the company is not for sale.'' The meeting was adjourned before shareholders could ask any questions. <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> said the offer was conditioned upon approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> board, sufficient financing being obtained and <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> not issuing any additional equity securities. A proposal to authorize issuance of new preferred stock was on the agenda for <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s annual meeting, and the company said shareholders approved it. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, publishes textbooks aimed at elementary through college grades as well as books of general interest.

 <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has denounced as `` totally without merit'' hostile suitor <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s questioning of preliminary results of a heated proxy battle that indicated <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> retained control of its board of directors. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> claimed Wednesday that the preliminary count <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> released earlier this week excluded at least 650,000 shares that holders attempted to vote in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s nominees It also claimed the holders of a preferred stock issue it is attempting to have invalidated provided a 318,000-share block favoring <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>. The stock was issued three months ago to 15 private investors as a defensive measure against the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. Each share guarantees voting rights beyond those of common shareholders. `` If we got the 650,000 shares counted for us ... and the preferred stock not permitted to be counted ... I believe that might be sufficient to swing the election in our favor,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the company had not formally challenged the proxy count, but simply was announcing its belief that the contest still was in doubt. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Falise </PERSON> called the complaints `` totally without merit'' and said the company was confident the final tally would jive with preliminary results. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said its shareholders at the May 6 annual meeting re-elected the incumbent directors, by 52 percent to 48 percent, over <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s slate of 16 nominees. Final results were expected to be released at a reconvened shareholders' meeting on May 24. Re-election of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board would constitute a vote of confidence in the company's defensive restructuring plan and friendly merger with the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second-largest bank, and rejection of against <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile buyout offer. In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> closed up 12.5 cents to $ 61.50 Wednesday while <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> fell 75 cents to $ 30.37 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which owns a 4.9 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, is offering $ 15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its stock for each of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s common shares outstanding. The offer is valued at around $ 64 a share or $ 1.1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said it would be willing to raise the stock portion of its bid to 1.675 <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> shares, adding $ 3.20 per share to the deal pushing its value to around $ 1.2 billion. The offer would be amended only if <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> agrees to a negotiated merger. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said if <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> refused to negotiate, it would buy the Irving shares tendered as of May 24 and operate the bank as a subsidiary for five years, thereby avoiding the poison pill. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said it owned or had been tendered about 50 percent of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s 18.5 million outstanding common shares. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> is offering $ 75 a share for 9.5 million Irving shares, or about 51 percent, valued at $ 707 million. In addition, it said it would pay shareholders interest on the purchase price from May 31 until the deal closes. The <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> bid is part of a complex restructuring plan that includes asset sales, cost-cutting measures and a $ 10-a-share special cash dividend. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said the offer has a blended value of between $ 65.20 and $ 72.55 a share.

<HEAD>U.S. Steelmakers Demand Negotiation, Threaten Litigation Over
Import Quotas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Failure to renew <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel import quotas may trigger a wave of trade litigation by American companies against foreign competitors, including <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the head of the main domestic industry trade group says. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steelmakers said Wednesday the recovery that trade protection helped made possible in their industry may have peaked for the time being. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> steel industry, so hard at work to make itself internationally competitive, will not stand idly by and watch that work undone by a repeat of the import abuses which threw our companies into a five-year bath of red ink,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, whose election to a rare third term as <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> chairman was announced Wednesday. Voluntary restraint agreements negotiated by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminisration with 31 foreign steelmaking nations expire in September 1989. The five-year quota plan was instituted partly to end a barrage of steelmaker lawsuits, many of them aimed at the government-subsidized mills of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` If a VRA extension is deemed unecessary by those in government, then we're prepared to flood the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- with trade case filings, if need be, in numbers which will make what came before the VRAs seem trivial by comparison,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> AISI </ORGANIZATION>'s annual conference. `` We do not want protection from efficient competition, nor do we need it,'' he said. `` We need and expect only a climate of fair trade and legal trading practices.'' Earlier Wednesday in a panel discussion, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' largest trading partner and the largest steel exporter not covered by the voluntary quotas, is vulnerable to a trade suit. The AISI, to which Canadian mills belong, wants <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> included if the quotas are extended. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> boosted its share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel market from what <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said is its fair share of 2.4 percent to 3.7 percent in 1987. The increase disadvantages <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other quota nations, he said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON>, chairman of the Canadian steelmaker <ORGANIZATION> Stelco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a speech Monday in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel exports have surged from 4.5 percent and 4.8 percent of the Canadian market in 1985 and 1986 respectively to 5.5 percent last year. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> also said Canadian steel is fairly traded. Separately, other industry leaders said steel's recovery may have peaked if, as they fear, customers soon stop building inventories. `` We're forecasting a decrease in the production rates in the automobile, appliance and private housing sectors. So we do n't see any driving forces for a continuation of the demand we're seeing today,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boni </PERSON> <PERSON> Boni </PERSON> said 1988 shipments probably would tail off to 75.5 million tons, roughly even with the 76 million tons shipped in 1987 and considerably shy of the 80 million tons talked about earlier this year, the second year of the industry's long-awaited recovery. The shipping rate bears directly on profits and employment. `` The reduction of 5 million tons obviously ... is going to reduce profits,'' <PERSON> Boni </PERSON> said without offering specific figures. But officials said they doubted such a slowdown sales would force any plants to close. `` The most difficult thing for us to call in this equation is customer inventory'' because no accurate surveys are available, said <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoag </PERSON> `` We know the customers built a lot of inventory last year. We feel certain they built some in the first half of this year and at some point they will discontinue building those inventories,'' he said. `` I think that will begin to occur sometime in the second half.''

 When the going got tough, one oil patch company turned to the newspaper classifieds for help. `` Please send MONEY. <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> needs cash to keep 50 people in jobs,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> ad placed by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Fitting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I had hoped I would never have to -LRB- place such an ad -RRB-,'' company president <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I'm not good at begging, but I think it has come to be just that.'' The ad, which appeared Tuesday, said contributors would not receive stock or securities, but merely a thank you from the company. The ad included a post office box where contributions could be sent. By early Wednesday afternoon, about 150 people had called the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> company since the ad appeared, most asking for the company's address, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said. `` They just indicated they would be putting something in the mail,'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said. Federal Flange, which produces pipe flanges used in oil fields, suffered severely in the energy downturn. The company slashed its workforce from 160 employees to about 50, including three of <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>'s 12 children and two of his nephews, he said Annual revenue has plunged to about $ 3.5 million from about $ 15 million in the early 1980s. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said the small ad also will appear in the Chronicle's sports section Sunday He said the newspaper had delayed printing it by a few days to make sure there was nothing wrong in printing it. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said he has been thinking about placing such an ad for months, but finally decided to do so after hearing about a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> radio announcer who asked for money and got it. KVIL-FM announcer <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> asked listeners to send in $ 20 without telling them why, and the station received $ 243,120 in four days. It later gave the money to charity. But <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flange </ORGANIZATION>'s need for money was no joke. He needs it to pay overdue bills and help keep him from having to file for bankruptcy. `` I find people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are very, very generous,'' he said. `` I have a lot of confidence in the generosity of people.'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, who has been battling <PERSON> Hodgkin </PERSON>'s disease for two years, said he also prays for his company's survival _ not money _ during mass. `` I do n't believe in praying for money,'' he said.

 Experts from 24 leading industrial countries met to discuss sharply different positions on agriculture policy but failed to reach accord, the top trade official of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> said today. `` They made some progress, but I do n't dare to say that there is yet complete agreement,'' said the official, <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, adding that the ministers planned to debate the issue further over lunch. The experts met overnight to attempt to reach consensus on farm policy reform, where the Americans and Europeans are at odds with each other. Trade and finance ministers from 24 countries of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> opened the meeting Wednesday. They were scheduled to issue a joint communique on agriculture and other economic issues at the close of today's meeting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> today reiterated that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was commited to ending all agricultural subsidies by the year 2000, but only if all other countries agreed to do the same. `` Such subsidies impose an enormous cost on consumers and taxpayers alike,'' he told a breakfast meeting with reporters. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had succeeded in reducing its farm subsidies from $ 26 billion in 1986 to a projected $ 17.5 billion for 1988. He said the figure was expected to fall further next year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> called for an early commitment by <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trading partners to phase out government subsidies used to prop up domestic farm prices and help boost agricultural exports. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> first proposed this last June. Leaders of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> rejected the idea as unrealistic. They said the reform emphasis should be on short-term measures such as production quotas that would reduce global surpluses. At a reception Wednesday evening, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> underscored the European view that negotiations on world trade liberalization should not single out farm issues. `` One can not rush into negotiations while forgetting that all matters have to be discussed, not only agriculture, but also industry and services,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they also want to see tangible progress by December in trade negotiations being conducted by the 96 member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. The Americans put special emphasis on reaching agreement on farm issues. Trade ministers from the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> countries are to meet in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> in December to review progress in the negotiations, which are just beginning. The next scheduled <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> meeting on agriculture is in early June. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be watching closely for results from the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> session. `` Undoubtedly, if progress seems blocked, the sentiment will be to legislate more policies and programs to offset the unfair trade practices of other nations,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> told Wednesday's ministerial meeting. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> told the meeting that such <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attacks on unfair trading practices were unnecessary and `` worsen the climate for negotiation'' on farm issues. He also criticized <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for cutting sugar imports, reducing or abandoning efforts to hold some farmland out of production, and contesting long-standing <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> subsidy programs for farmers. The <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> secretariat said in a report published on Tuesday that aid to farmers in the 24 member countries amounted to about $ 245 billion in 1984-86. That is roughly double the total for 1979-81, it said.

<HEAD>London Share Prices Recover From Lows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices recovered by midday Thursday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after opening broadly lower in a response to earlier declines in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Traders said the market was steadying after its early jitters, helped in part by neutral British economic news reported late in the morning. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 14.8 points, or 0.8 percent, at 1,762.8 at about 12:15 p.m. local time. The index had been down as much as 24.3 points earlier in the session. Volume was 280.0 million shares, up from 255.3 million shares at midday Wednesday. Earlier in the session, the market withstood a barrage of economic reports which traders said appeared to paint a neutral picture of the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> economy. A provisional 0.9 percent rise in the money supply was considered equal to or better than market expectations. Industrial production and earnings data also suggested the economy was n't overheating Unemployment, which dropped to 8.8 percent in April from 9 percent in March, was lower than expected. `` People are n't really worried about inflation'' as they were earlier in the week following the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> March trade figures, said a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trader. `` What we're waiting for is Wall Street.'' Another weak start to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market could unnerve <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> traders. Several said the Dow Jones industrial average's drop of more than 35 points on Wednesday left Wall Street vulnerable.

<HEAD>Four Savings and Loans Merged in Southwest Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By READ MARTIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal regulators provided a $ 2 billion assistance package to combine four insolvent thrifts into a Dallas-based savings and loan as part of the federal plan to revive the flagging industry. <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the state's 18th largest thrift, agreed to acquire 78 offices and branches of the four troubled S & amp; Ls. The plan, announced Wednesday, may be the largest merger in the federal <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plan </LOCATION> designed to rescue the state's ailing thrifts, officials said. The four thrifts to be acquired within the next year are <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lamar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION>, the state's 11th largest S & amp; L, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angelo </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Briercroft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>. The Federal Savings and <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will spend a record $ 2 billion on the deal over a 10-year period, <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> is contributing $ 25 million of subordinated debt to the consolidated company as equity, but no outside capital will be used. The thrifts have combined assets of more than $ 4 billion, 75 percent of which are in commercial and `` non-conventional'' real estate, and combined deposits of more than $ 4.4 billion, <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. `` There's no desire to create mega-thrifts,'' <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. `` But when you absorb four institutions, you've got a lot of work in front of you. We do n't have much larger institutions so we do n't anticipate much larger transactions. <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said even though the merger will begin with a large, 116-branch outfit, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> will quickly begin shutting down its duplicated services. `` Within six months of the transaction, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> will make a substantial reduction in branches, especially where there is duplication,'' he said. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>, said the company planned to substantially reduce the number of branches. `` We do n't know how many branches we will close,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. But he said customers of all the thrifts will be notified of branch closings by mail. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has now resolved the problems of eight <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts under the Southwest Plan, which was announced by the board in February and initiated last week. The Southwest Plan goal is to fold 109 or more insolvent S & amp; Ls into 25 to 30 surviving institutions. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> granted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> authority to raise up to $ 10.8 billion from the industry to fund recapitalization of surviving thrifts. The merger of four ailing thrifts into Houston-based Coastal Banc Savings was the first consolidation under the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> plan in a transaction that involved a $ 138 million contribution from the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. That transaction included $ 3.5 million from a private investment group. `` All of these transactions will be unique,'' <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. `` This one does n't include outside capital. Some transactions in the future will have significant outside capital.'' As part of its assistance in the deal, the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> will provide <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> with a 10-year note worth about $ 483 million. In exchange, the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> will receive warrants to purchase 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock. The <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> will receive 90 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>' first $ 60 million in profits. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Colgren </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FHLB </ORGANIZATION>, said officials believe <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> will show a profit within two years. <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> <PERSON> Savings </PERSON> had total assets as of March 31 of $ 543 million with a net worth of negative $ 347.7 million and deposits of $ 784 million. <ORGANIZATION> Lamar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the object of a lawsuit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> for regulatory violations, has total assets of $ 1.9 billion, a net worth of negative $ 331.9 million and deposits of $ 2.1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has assets of $ 687.3 million, a net worth of negative $ 221.9 million and deposits of $ 866.2 million. <PERSON> Briercroft </PERSON> has total assets of $ 868.1 million, a net worth of negative $ 22.7 million and deposits of $ 658 million. Before Wednesday's purchase, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> had total assets of $ 1.48 billion, a net worth of $ 27.6 million and deposits of $ 998 million. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the Southwest Plan should be completed within the next 12 months.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> management, led by the president of the San Francisco-based conglomorate, has proposed an all-cash buyout for the purchase of the company at a value of $ 41 per share. `` The company stated that it has been advised that management has been discussing financing for the buyout with a leading financial institution and is confident that such financing can be obtained,'' the company said in a statement issued on Wednesday at a special board of directors' meeting.

<HEAD>Texas Banking Industry May Suffer Worst Year Ever, FDIC Chief Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banking industry may record its worst year ever in 1988 although the problems of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks will top out this year, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says. `` It seems clear that the problems will peak this year,'' chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Most of the major banks have been dealt with or will have been handled.'' More than half of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks reported lower earnings during the first three months, and one-third of the state's banks lost money, he said. Among larger institutions _ ones with assets of more than $ 100 million, two-fifths lost money, with charge-offs growing at twice 1987 levels, <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> officials reported. Bank failures in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, including 25 already this year, should reach 70 by yearend, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. In the last five years, one-third of the banks closed were less than five years old. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> also said regulators are in negotiations with potential purchasers of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We are talking to people. We hope we can arrange some resolution to that situation in the near future. How soon, only time will tell,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> told reporters. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> is studying methods to remedy inequities in policies that now allow it insure all deposits in large failing banks, while limiting exposure to the normal $ 100,000 maximum at smaller institutions, he confirmed. The agency in March provided such blanket coverage for deposits held by <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, prompting complaints by area independent bankers. Regulators believe there has been no mass redistribution of funds to <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> as a result of the expanded guarantee, although, `` We have had a great number of protests about the inequities,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said `` banks in the area,'' not foreign institutions, pulled funds from <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, triggering the company's solvency crisis and eventually the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1 billion cash infusion in March. Comparing the earlier woes at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which last month completed a $ 1.5 billion federally assisted recapitalization. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said that bank `` never had the kind of run that developed at First Republic.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> did not prompt <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> to suspend interest payments on all debt last week, raising the specter of a bankruptcy filing, was not prompted by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. `` The -LRB- First Republic -RRB- board acted on its own judgment,'' he said. `` We are in daily contact with them. We have people stationed in the bank, so we are aware of what they are doing.'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, 68, lured out of retirement to run <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, has not been instructed to shrink the bank so that it might be more appealing to potential purchasers. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> blamed the continuing <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> troubles on the duration of the state's recession and lack of an established branch-banking system `` which tended to make it -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- much more susceptible to problems.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'s once-buoyant economy shielded bankers from the conservative lending practices of more recession-prone areas, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Beef Prices Increase In Latest Survey, NCA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The average price of beef rose 12 cents a pound over a month ago, the Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The average price in its May 12 survey of prices in 19 cities nationwide was $ 2.82 per pound, up from $ 2.70 in the survey on April 14. Seasonal increases in demand _ especially for steak _ helped trigger the higher costs for consumer beef, the association said. Sirloin, for example, was $ 3.62 per pound, up from $ 3.30 a month ago, while round steak was up from $ 2.47 to $ 2.52. T-Bone steak averages rose from $ 4.62 to $ 4.89. Ground beef prices also rose from $ 1.40 in April to $ 1.42 in May, while chuck roast, the only category to come in lower in May, dropped from $ 1.74 to $ 1.68. The <ORGANIZATION> NCA </ORGANIZATION> said demand for roasts generally drops during summer months. The five-cut average, which also was above the average of $ 2.71 of May 1987, rose in 14 cities and was down in five.

The <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s statement said the rating was `` based on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s current low level of debt, the expectation that future borrowing will remain within a comfortable range relative to the nation's debt-servicing capacity, and the progress made in stabilizing Chinese politics since the death of Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Zedong </PERSON> in 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign debt is low by international standards, totaling an estimated $ 27 billion at the end of last year.

However, it said, `` the scope and the nature of the changes underway are unprecedented, with major policy contradictions yet to be resolved.'' `` Discontent has emerged, primarily because of the dramatic shifts in the control of resources and in the distribution of benefits, but also because progress on political liberalization has been slow,'' the statement said.

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which hit the lowest point in more than three months on Wednesday, was down 9.28 points to 1,941.81 as of 10 a.m. EDT on Wall Street.

 The deficit in the fund that insures deposits in the nation's savings institutions more than doubled last year and congressional action `` may well be needed'' to keep it operating, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said today. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the auditing arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s liabilities exceeded its assets at the end of 1987 by $ 13.7 billion, up from the deficit of $ 6.3 billion a year earlier. In testimony prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the fund, which guarantees individual deposits up to $ 100,000 in 3,120 S & amp; Ls, was in `` precarious financial condition.'' It said the money available to the fund `` probably will not be adequate'' to resolve the problems of the nation's 505 insolvent institutions. `` While <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> has the resources to continue operating in the near future, it may not have sufficient resources to effectively deal with the industry's current and future problems,'' <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s accounting and financial management division, said in the testimony. Replying to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates federally insured S & amp; Ls, said the deficit does not mean the insurance fund lacks cash to deal with current problems. He said it has $ 4 billion and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L customers `` should be assured their deposits are fully insured.'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said the fact that <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> may need more money down the road `` comes as a surprise to no one.'' But he added, `` The thing I'm sensitive to is that there not be any kind of unneccessary concern in the time sense We clearly have significant amounts of resources available to deal with -LRB- the worst 200 institutions. -RRB- After that, you get into predicting the future.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report comes only nine months after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized the sale of $ 10.8 billion in bonds over three years to bring the fund enough money to clean up the ailing industry, which has been hard hit by the bust of oil and real estate markets in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. `` We believe that further congressional action, beyond that already taken, ... may well be needed to enable -LRB- the fund -RRB- to continue to meet its obligations and provide the deposit insurance it is mandated to provide,'' the accounting office said. Although <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> did not explicitly say a taxpayer bailout will be required, he said `` it appears unlikely that the industry would have the resources to provide such funding.'' Officials of the bank board expect the bond sales, the premium fees it charges institutions and the proceeds from selling the assets of closed institutions to provide about $ 20 billion over the next three years and $ 28 billion over 10 years. However, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said, `` We view <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s projections with significant reservations.'' He said the agency's estimates of both the cost of the bailout and the money it will have to spend are too optimistic. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board officials last month had estimated the FSLIC deficit at $ 11.6 billion _ $ 2.1 billion less than the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> figure. They also said it would cost $ 15.3 billion to take care of the worst-off 204 thrift institutions and a total of $ 21.8 billion to rescue all insolvent thrifts. However, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said it would cost $ 17.4 billion to resolve the problems of `` the more than 200 hopelessly insolvent institutions'' and $ 26.4 billion to $ 36.4 billion to clean up all insolvent S & amp; Ls. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> warned that this figure does not include an additional 435 institutions, which it said are `` barely solvent.'' Private analysts have estimated the total cost of restoring the industry to health to be as high as $ 60 billion. In making its $ 21.8 billion estimate, the bank board is assuming that interest rates will not increase significantly and that virtually no new problem cases will develop in the next 10 years _ a view <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> called `` extremely optimistic.'' Regulators also are assuming that insured deposits would grow by 7 percent a year and that nearly all healthy <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls would remain in the insurance fund even after a law blocking their withdrawal expires in August. Growth of deposits slowed in 1985, 1986 and 1987 and has only been accelerating since last October. Also, if a special insurance premium assessed S & amp; Ls is continued as the bank board expects, healthy thrifts would be encouraged to leave <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> to avoid the added cost. That would reduce its deposit base and income further, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. But, he said, `` Without continuing the special assessment, there is no shred of hope of resolving <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s financial plight without turning to the taxpayer.'' Bank board officials also project the interest rate on bonds floated to recapitalize the insurance fund will remain below 10 percent even though rates already are edging higher. And, they assume they will take care of most ailing S & amp; Ls by merging them with healthier institutions, a cheaper alternative than shutting down an institution and paying off depositors. However, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> noted that over the last five years, 37 percent of the cases have been resolved through liquidations, and of the remaining cases resolved by merger, some have resulted in institutions that are still weak, only bigger. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> also said regulators are counting on investors to take <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> notes, rather than cash, in exchange for taking over an ailing institution. That, he said, `` remains an open question.'' Wall replied that because the economy has strengthened it is `` clearly not the case anymore'' that there is a lack of interest in mergers. `` We have more interest in these institutions -LRB- in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- than we ever expected. ... We have an embarrasment of riches in that sense,'' he said.

 The federal official who headed the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s latest study of the financial market crash defended its recommendations today, saying the recent dramatic price swings on the markets do not require dramatic fixes. But members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee said they were dissatisfied with the study. `` The issue of daily volatility, although an expressed public concern, is not in the category of systemic threat, in my opinion,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>. `` However disconcerting such volatility can be on a short term basis, it is important not to attempt cures that can do more harm than good.'' Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., the subcommittee's chairman, criticized <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s report, saying, `` history will judge your work product far more harshly than -LRB- did -RRB- your boss, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The White House has praised the stock market study that <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> and his associates produced. Rep. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the subcommittee, said of the report's conclusions, `` They certainly did not go far enough.'' The working group that produced the study consisted of <LOCATION> Gould </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>. Their report recommended that the nation's stock, futures and options markets set up a `` circuit breaker'' that would allow them to halt all trading on days when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunges by historic levels. The study suggested that improvements be made in the credit, clearing and settlement systems the markets use to conduct and complete transactions. In addition, the group said it should remain in existence `` to function as a coordinating and consulting mechanism for intermarket issues.'' The report offered no proposals for limiting computer-driven program trading, a strategy that involves futures and stock transactions that critics say has helped fueled the markets' volatility in recent months Also absent were recommendations to change the levels of margins, or downpayments, for futures transactions, a move that supporters say would diminish speculation. In addition, the group did not endorse a proposal advanced by an earlier <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, headed by investment banker <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, that a single federal agency _ probably the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> _ should oversee issues that concern all of the markets. Instead, the officials seemed to shrug off the contentions of many lawmakers and investors that dramatic steps need to be taken quickly to avoid repeats of days like last Oct. 19, when the Dow plunged a record 508 points. Since that time, many small investors have left the market. `` When you get a shock to the system that occurred on Oct. 19, people withdraw,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said Monday. `` It's a cycle. They come back, they leave, they come back. ... They will be back.'' The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell more than 35 points Wednesday and was at its lowest level in more than three months.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it will sell its <ORGANIZATION> Talbots </ORGANIZATION> women's clothing chain and its <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> outdoor apparel unit, the only remaining subsidiaries not related to food products, for $ 585 million. The food giant said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Jusco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> will purchase <ORGANIZATION> Talbots </ORGANIZATION> for $ 325 million, and <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 260 million for <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>. Both are cash transactions. Proceeds from the sales will result in an after-tax profit of more than $ 200 million, or a minimum $ 2.35 a share, said <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer H.B. Atwater Jr.. Much of the remaining $ 400 million will be used to repurchase stock in the coming months, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> has 84.3 million common shares outstanding. General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> announced in January that it was considering selling the two retail units, the only remaining subsidiaries not related to food processing or food marketing. <ORGANIZATION> Talbots </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Hingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, sells classic women's apparel and accessories in 126 stores in 26 states. Its annual revenue, including catalog sales, exceeds $ 340 million, which represented about 6 percent of General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>' total revenue. <ORGANIZATION> Jusco </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest retailers with annual sales of about $ 7.6 billion, plans to continue to operate <ORGANIZATION> Talbots </ORGANIZATION> with its existing employees, management and headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> Jusco </ORGANIZATION> has had a business relationship with General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> since 1982, when the two companies formed a joint venture to develop and operate Red Lobster restaurants in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, a specialty retailer that sells sportswear, gifts and outdoor equipment through catalogs and 58 retail stores in 14 states and in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, has annual sales of about $ 255 million. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> will continue to be based in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. He called the acquisition `` a very significant step in <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION>'s growth plans. Spiegel markets women's and men's apparel, home furnishings and other general merchandise through catalogs and had revenue of more than $ 1 billion in 1987. `` <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>'s customer base for both its retail and catalog operations is composed principally of men in upper income households, whereas <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> caters primarily to upper income women,'' <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> said. Both transactions are expected to be completed within six weeks, General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said.

 Stock prices eroded sharply this morning in moderate trading, extending a two-day slide that brokers have blamed on rising fear of inflation and higher interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which hit the lowest point in more than three months on Wednesday, was down 15.91 points to 1,935.18 as of noon EDT on Wall Street.

 Corporate takeover artists are waging their own political campaigns this election year. They call them proxy contests. Rather than merely throwing money at shareholders to buy their way into companies, raiders are exerting new pressure on their targets by trying to infiltrate the boardroom. Convinced they can do more with a company's assets than incumbent management, outsiders are asking shareholders to cast their lots with them by voting in a new regime. Often without track records of their own, raiders promise shareholders handsome returns in exchange for their support of a rival slate of board candidates. The process is not for the faint of heart or purse. Experts estimate it can cost up to $ 10 million to wage a full-blown proxy battle, replete with newspaper ads, mass mailings and phone solicitations. While that's a steep price tag for a fight that usually favors management, it's sometimes worth the expense. By testing the hinges on the palace gates, some proxy warriors have stirred entrenched managers to make big changes and raise the value of their stock to the delight of common shareholders. Corporate gunslingers have had few dead shots with the proxy weapon, but their aim is getting better. In recent weeks, managements at <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> came perilously close to losing control of their boards in heated proxy contests. Even more revealing, a study of 60 proxy fights between 1978 and 1985 conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> found that, in many cases, top managers eventually resigned even after beating back challenges from outside. A challenger's typical tactics include painting a `` broad-brush picture of managerial inefficiency, using a variety of easy-to-convey criticisms such as poor operating profits or an allegedly inadequate dividend payout,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAngelo </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> who co-authored the study. Until recently, proxy contests were not waged against corporate heavyweights. Experts say the new wave is a result of corporate defensive maneuvers like poison pills and state laws that make unwanted takeovers cumbersome. Poison pills and new legislation `` have become significant deterrents to the purchasing of a major stake in a company,'' <PERSON> DeAngelo </PERSON> said. Aggressors believe their allies, if elected, can work to rescind poison pills that may be in place and can help push for a deal. The proxy battles that ensue are `` a form of pressure on companies ... an amplification of takeover strategy,'' said attorney <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s committee on proxy fights and tender offers He noted that until recently, raiders used proxy battles `` as a way to obtain control of a whole company without paying for it ... but now we're finding a lot of these contests are connected with tender offers.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> sought seats for himself and two allies on the board of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in conjunction with his $ 1.8 billion tender offer for the communications company. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s bid was complicated by two classes of stock, one of which put control of the company in the hands of the <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> family, owners of 70 percent of Media General's more powerful Class B shares. Management's main advantage in these fights is financial. Because they control the pursestrings, corporate chieftains can spend a lot of money to make their own case. `` They have all the corporte resources at their disposal _ and that's shareholder money _ to do as many mailings as they want, which is tremendously expensive,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Heard </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shareholders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a shareholder rights organization headed by <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Management also has a better idea who the major shareholders are and can court them quickly Some experts estimate as much as 50 percent of a corporation's stock is held in street name, or the name of a broker or another nominee instead of the customer who will vote the shares Proxy solicitors hired by outsiders spend countless hours trying to trace shareholders through a confusing web of surface organizations. Institutional shareholders, who control a major portion of corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, often are more inclined to side with management because of possible reprisals. `` They know if they do n't, they will be punished,'' <PERSON> DeAngelo </PERSON> said. In <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s case, for example, institutional investors were believed to hold as much as 65 percent of the 115 million oustanding shares. One source involved in a recent, high-profile proxy battle noted that `` management has a lot more political strings to pull than the people from outside who have to persuade stockholders.'' Difficult to document but nonetheless pervasive are management threats and behind-the-scenes arm-twisting. One source said management puts pressure on institutions with which it has business relationships, sometimes threatening to sever those ties if dissatisfied with their vote. `` That's a tremendous advantage and it's very unfair,'' the source said. Winning or losing is not so easy to judge in these affairs, however. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, notes that it all depends on how success is measured. <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which has had an outstanding tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had sought six seats on the company's board. Although the results of the vote wo n't be available for some time, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> made its point even if <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s directors are re-elected. `` Anytime a board is facing an election contest, management becomes increasingly concerned about how shareholders view the job they are doing,'' he said. `` In the case of USG, I question whether management would have ever proposed the recapitalization plan that they did ... were it not for the battle for our slate of candidates.'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was referring to <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to spend about $ 2.2 billion to pay shareholders a one-time dividend that includes cash, stock and notes for each common share. Despite the expense and emotional wear-and-tear of a proxy battle, some say raiders merely are hoping to cash out at a higher price. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> bristled at that suggestion, noting that `` our objective is to acquire the company.'' `` You do see success in terms of what I think is a increased accountability to stockholders on the part of incumbent management and the board,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. Despite the advantage management might have, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said the proxy process is a good one. `` I would hate to see any barriers to free elections of directors. I think the free-election process has tremendous motivation for incumbent management and boards to be responsive to the wishes of their constituents.''

 Winning a proxy contest is no job guarantee for current managers. According to an analysis of 60 proxy contests, management resignations typically follow a proxy battle even when outsiders fail to win seats on a company's board of directors, according to two researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION>. Professors <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAngelo </PERSON>, who studied the contests between 1978 and 1985, noted that about two-thirds of the time, top managers resigned within three years of a proxy fight, with the majority of the changes coming within one year. That includes managers who lost their jobs when disssident shareholders won control of their companies, which happened about 30 percent of the time. Perhaps even more significant, the two found that only about 20 percent of the companies they studied remained publicly held corporations run by the same management teams three years after the proxy contests. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAngelo </PERSON> pointed to two examples: _ <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Pullman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, resigned in November 1978 even though dissident shareholders were defeated in a proxy fight Two years later, the company was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Wheelabrator-Frye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ In the case of <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION>, a group of dissident shareholders backed by <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> won four out of 10 board seats in an April 1984 proxy fight Four months later, the company's president and chief executive officer <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurshan </PERSON> resigned Within a year, the company was liquidated. The DeAngelos say their findings raise serious questions about claims that proxy contests are an inefficient way to discipline managers of publicly held corporations. In many cases of management resignations, the new manager is designed to accommodate the dissidents' interest, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAngelo </PERSON> said. `` These findings suggest that, independent of its immediate outcome, a proxy challenge does pose a serious threat to managerial tenure,'' the study said.

<HEAD>With BC-Proxy Fights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 The more proxy contests, and the grizzlier, the more business booms for proxy solicitors. Solicitors are responsible for the gritty legwork in a proxy battle. They track down shareholders and talk to them, draft letters and write newspaper ads, send out mailings, tally votes, and serve as general hand-holders to whichever side they happen to represent. `` They've got it down to a science,'' one observer remarked. The <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest solicitors with 1987 fee income of more than $ 22 million, has had a hand in several major proxy fights recently. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, the group's president, said the cost of a proxy battle can range anywhere from $ 1 million to $ 10 million. Because a large precentage of any company's stock is held by institutional investors or in street names _ names other than the actual shareholder _ simply identifying just who owns the outstanding shares is a job for a first-rate sleuth. At <ORGANIZATION> Georgeson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's oldest proxy solicitor, managing director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said he relies on a database that has been built up over time linking individuals and their securities holdings. Once shareholders are identified, solicitors have to convince them to vote in a particular direction. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> estimates his people talk by phone with 2 million shareholders a year in an attempt to influence voting. Some firms have even been known to hire actors to use Southern accents in an attempt to sway shareholders in Southern states, observers say. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said new technology allowing shareholders to vote by phone has `` added a new dimension'' to solicitation. `` When we get finished speaking with a shareholder, we give them a toll-free number and ask them to call immediately if they agree with us,'' he said. `` Within five minutes, we know if they're telling the truth that they're going to vote with us.'' If the shareholder does n't call in with a vote, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s people are back on the phone. Newspaper ads are also crucial to the proxy process, but they are not directed toward the individual shareholder. Rather, they are aimed at the investment community _ both large institutional investors as well as brokers who may be asked for advice from individual clients. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, said solicitors are `` totally key to the entire process. They help identify and contact shareholders, they give you their prognosis of how the vote is stacking up and they make sure proxies are properly executed so they do n't get thrown out on a technicality.'' Desert Partners sought seats on the board of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a recent proxy contest. The partnership also launched a tender offer for USG shares. As for the latest wave of proxy battles that has come to center on large corporations, `` business is the busiest ever'' for solicitors, <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said.

 Authorities today captured the last two of seven men charged in a wire transfer scheme that siphoned $ 70 million from the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> to banks in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, authorities said. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said Wednesday that the conspiracy was cracked before the suspects could withdraw the money transferred illegally from the accounts of three of First National's corporate customers. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said authorities had filed charges of illegal wire transfer of funds against two <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> employees, a third <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> man, and three men from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. He identified <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, as ringleader of the failed scheme. Four of the men were arrested late Tuesday or early Wednesday. A fifth man, bank employee <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 27, has been charged but is cooperating with authorities. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendeloff </PERSON> said the arrests were made early today in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. He identified the two as <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON>, about age 50, and the Rev. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, but added that no further details were available immediately. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said that $ 70 million was transferred illegally Friday from the accounts of three of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate customers _ Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>; New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky.-based distiller <ORGANIZATION> Brown-Foreman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ to two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks. The money then was transferred to three accounts in two banks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said no money had been withdrawn from <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, or from <ORGANIZATION> Creditanstalt </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Focobank </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` But you could call this sophisticated in that the money actually made it to the -LRB- Austrian -RRB- banks,'' said <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>. First National spokesman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Zehnder </PERSON> said neither the nation's 10th-largest bank nor the three corporate customers whose accounts were involved in the wire-transfer scheme would lose any money. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said authorities were attempting to determine whether the accounts at the Viennese banks were fictitious. Two were in the names of companies, <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, and a third was in the name of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. `` Our investigation into whether others are involved is continuing,'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. He said evidence would be presented to a federal grand jury as it considers further charges. Four of the suspects appeared for an initial bond hearing late Wednesday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON>. The four _ <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 31, both of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Herschel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 30, and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 30, both of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ were returned to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> pending another bond hearing Friday. Federal agents began investigating the scheme after <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> officials uncovered a $ 24 million shortfall Monday and notified the bank, which in turn notified authorities, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Detroit-to-Chicago </LOCATION> connection involved <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s cousin. He said that <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> recruited <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> employees <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, both of whom allegedly participated in the scheme by providing confidential information such as code words and confirming messages for the transactions. That enabled the schemers to circumvent the bank's security procedures, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> agreed late Tuesday to contact several other members of the alleged scheme and discuss the matter while wearing a recording device.

 Prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fell Thursday as the market was pressured by a slump on Wall Street. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 17 points, or 1 percent, at 1,760.6. Volume was a moderate 438.1 million shares, compared with Wednesday's 536.1 million shares. The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as much as 25 points in the last hour of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, disappointing many <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> players. Several dealers said rumors of large stock sales in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by Japanese investors also did not bode well for the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market. A large computer-generated trading program involving disposal of several stocks late in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> afternoon also contributed to the pressure, some traders said. `` I would say it's more a case of lethargy than outright pessimism,'' said one equity salesman, adding that `` unless we get some more bids and corporate activity, we wo n't have anything to keep the market alive.'' A battery of <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> economic indicators released earlier Thursday were digested by the market without causing much of a stir, dealers said. A provisional rise in the money supply of 0.9 percent in April was equal to or better than market expectations. March industrial production rose 1.2 percent and the annual rate of increase in average earnings remained unchanged at 8.5 percent in March, suggesting the British economy was not immediately overheating. Unemployment, which dropped to 8.8 percent in April from 9 percent in March, was lower than expected.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar traded in a narrow range Thursday in quiet European trading amid uncertainty about currency's direction Gold prices rose. Foreign exchange dealers said dollar trading was dull because of a lack of conviction among market players on where the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency is headed in the short-term. Dealers were also uncertain whether this week's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures, which revealed the trade deficit fell to $ 9.75 billion in March from $ 13.8 billion in February, were an aberration or the beginning of a trend. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound finished mixed. It was quoted at $ 1.8665 late Thursday, more expensive for buyers than $ 1.8605 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.6990 West German marks, down from 1.7055; 1.4155 Swiss francs, down from 1.4215; 5.7542 French francs, down from 5.7700; 1.9042 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9090; 1,262.00 Italian lire, down from 1,265.50; and 1.2442 Canadian dollars, up from 1.24125. Earlier, the dollar fell 0.73 yen to a closing 124.80 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, in what traders said was a correction following sharp gains on the back of the trade report. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 124.87 yen. Gold prices rose in active European trading. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the metal was quoted at a late bid price of $ 456.90 a troy ounce, up from $ 453.70 late Wednesday. Dealers said a rush to buy soybeans by commodity dealers in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> helped boost gold prices. Higher prices for the beans following dry weather in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plains threaten to cause an increase in food prices and inflation and thus make gold _ a favorite hedge against inflation _ more desirable. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price for gold was $ 458, up from $ 454 late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 3.02 to close at a bid $ 457.56. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid $ 6.72 a troy ounce, up from Wednesday's $ 6.58.

<HEAD>US, Europe Set Aside Differences On Farm Trade Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A conference of leading industrial nations ended Thursday after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> failed to persuade <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments to accept its proposal for ending public aid to farmers by the year 2000. However, trade and finance ministers from the 24 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said they would work together to reform global farm trading rules. The European countries held out against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to set a timetable for phasing out subsidies designed to prop up farm prices and boost exports. These efforts already are under way, with little apparent progress, in the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva-based body that sets and monitors world trade rules. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they would have preferred a more specific commitment to press ahead with farm policy reforms, but that differences with the Europeans were not insurmountable. `` We're basically on the same wave length,'' said <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> special trade representative. `` What we achieved in this meeting is a recognition of the fact that ... we've got to begin to develop the specifics of the negotiating outlines,'' he added. Officials from other countries took a more modest view of the meeting's outcome. <PERSON> Kjell-Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON>, Swedish finance minister and chairman of the meeting, told reporters the Americans wanted a commitment to start reforming farm trade rules in 1989, while `` others believed it should be a gradual process.'' `` I would n't dare to say this has been resolved,'' he said. <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, the top trade official of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, or Common Market, would never accept the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> idea of eliminating all farm subsidies. `` For us it is a question of reduction -LRB- of subsidies -RRB-, not phasing out,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> both spend about $ 25 billion a year on farm subsidies. They agree that this aid has become too burdensome, but they disagree over how to correct the problem. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, the Austrialian foreign minister, told reporters he was pleased the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting had avoided an open clash over what he called apparently irreconcilable differences between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European officials. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> made a similar assessment. `` The main thing was to avoid a needless ... clash which would have been a counterproductive signal,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> communique said the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> should achieve solid progress in all areas _ including rules for trading in services such as banking _ by December, when a review conference will be held. `` As they enter their more difficult phase, it is vital to ensure the momentum of these ambitious negotiations,'' the joint declaration said. The trade and finance ministers, in a broad review of the state of the world economy, said economic growth was much stronger than had been expected in the immediate aftermath of last October's stock market crash They said world trade was growing robustly, inflation was holding at a low level, global trade imbalances were improving and international cooperation on economic issues was growing. The ministers added, however, that problems remain, including protectionism, or actions by governments to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. The statement said the top priority for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be to further reduce its federal budget deficit. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was praised for its efforts to increase imports and stimulate domestic consumer demand. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was urged to increase the flexibility of its labor and financial markets and to reform its agricultural policies. The ministers also agreed the current approach to easing the debt burdens of poorer nations should be continued. They said each debtor's situation should be considered individually rather than applying an across-the-board formula for financial relief.

Lawyer <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimicles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Haverford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> proposed the restructuring in a May 5 letter. <PERSON> Chimicles </PERSON> represents <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, who claim in a federal court lawsuit that <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> officers and directors breached their fiduciary duty to stockholders by rejecting <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s $ 61.50-per-share offer to buy all of the company's stock. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> has since increased the offer to $ 70 per share, or about $ 2 billion. He also is waging a proxy fight to have himself and two associates elected to <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors at Friday's annual meeting. The takeover proposal will not be voted on at the meeting. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Leader </ORGANIZATION> `` management intends to recommend against pursuing'' <PERSON> Chimicles </PERSON>' proposal. `` We are not recommending any form of recapitalization at this time,'' he added. <PERSON> Chimicles </PERSON> said in his letter his proposal would be better than a clear victory by either side in court. He said a <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> defeat would result in a decline in Media General stock. A <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> victory would benefit shareholders, <PERSON> Chimicles </PERSON> said, `` but perhaps not the the degree available'' under his plan. The lawyer said he retained a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> investment banking company, <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, to formulate a plan that would boost stockholder value in Media General, divide the company into two units, give <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> `` a fair return on his investment'' and enable members of the <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> family to retain control of the company's newsprint and newspaper businesses, which include the News-Leader and the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> and his associates own 10.1 percent of Media General Class A stock, an investment of more than $ 111 million. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> family members own 70 percent of the company's Class B stock which, in effect, controls the company, and about 12 percent of the publicly traded Class A stock. <PERSON> Chimicles </PERSON> said Media General's cable franchises in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fredericksburg </LOCATION>, three commercial television stations in the Southeast and a broadcast services operation are valued at about $ 580.5 million. Under the plan, <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> would be given 27 percent of the new company, based on his Media General investment. Each Media General stockholder would receive one share in the new company for each <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> share held. Under that structure, the broadcast company would be capitalized with more than 34.9 million shares of common stock, valued at about $ 16.50 each. <PERSON> Chimicles </PERSON> said the new company would be operated under a one-share, one-vote principle. The company less its broadcast properties would be operated as Media General is now, with Class B stock closely held and controlling the firm, and Class A stock publicly traded but with less voting power.

 <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is phasing out its Radio Shack Model 200 laptop computer, a mainstay for journalists, and expects to run out of inventories by around the end of the year, the company said Thursday. The Model 200, which has a flip-up, flat-panel screen, has been reduced to a clearance price of $ 499, down from $ 799. That makes it the same price as the Model 102, which has a smaller, built-in screen and will remain in production. The Model 200 enjoyed its greatest market penetration in the newspaper business, where reporters used it to write stories while away from the office, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Juge </PERSON>, director of market planning for <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, Texas-based <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Juge </PERSON> said the Model 200 was squeezed from the bottom by the Model 102 and from the top by the Model 1400, a $ 1,499 computer introduced last August that has more memory and runs industry-standard MS-DOS software.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gun manufacturer will make semiautomatic carbines similar to the Israeli <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under a contract described as the first such agreement with a communist country, the company announced Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Weaver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> will sell the first shipments of its 9mm Nighthawk carbines in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and plans to sell the guns to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> police agencies, private citizens and Third World military, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, company president. The initial production agreement, which the company said was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, prohibits sale of the guns to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but the company hopes eventually to open that market, <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s public affairs office did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation that it was the first time an American gun company had been allowed to make weapons in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. One arms industry analyst downplayed the value of such a weapon to the military or police, saying there are plenty of other semiautomatic weapons available to them. Semiautomatics fire once each time the trigger is pulled. It is legal for civilians to own semiautomatic weapons in this country, but fully automatic guns are illegal. The principal value of the deal would be to give <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> a cheap product for sale to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> collectors and others who value guns that look like the short-barreled Uzis they see on television, said the analyst, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Fetter </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Forecast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, publisher of World Weapons Week. `` Everybody wants to walk around being macho these days,'' <PERSON> Fetter </PERSON> said. `` The gun-loving public wants something that makes them look like a special forces trooper yet is legal.'' <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> signed an agreement with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government at a ceremony May 14 in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and expects to begin production in 90 days, with the first shipment of 10,000 guns planned by January 1989. `` We're very excited,'' <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said. `` It's an agreement that's never been accomplished before between a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> arms company and a communist country. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> refused to divulge the value of the contract or the location of the factory in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, saying the Chinese insisted on secrecy for the time being. The guns are expected to sell for $ 525 retail. The Uzi goes for $ 698 in this country, and the other similar gun, the German HK94, retails for $ 800, <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said. The publicly held company also has designed a 9mm pistol and an ultralight submachine gun, but neither is yet in production, <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said.

 Stock prices eroded today in moderate trading, extending a two-day slide that brokers have blamed on rising fear of inflation and higher interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which hit the lowest point in more than three months on Wednesday, was down as much as 25 points this morning although it rebounded to 1,950.27 as of 3 p.m. EDT, down 0.82. Broader market indices weakened. Despite a rash of good economic news, the stock market has instead focused on rising yields in the bond market, a barometer of inflation and interest rates. With 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds yielding about 9.3 percent, the highest since the October stock crash, many investors are finding bonds more attractive. `` The market today is continuing the selloff that's been in progress for the last couple of days, primarily in reaction to the fact that the bond market is providing some very meaningful competition in attracting money,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Groveman </PERSON>, head of equity trading at <ORGANIZATION> Ladenburg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thalmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The stock market is trying to go down to a level where it can attract some buyers relative to the bond market,'' he said.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Up Sharply As Grains, Soybeans Advance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Wheat futures closed sharply higher Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and contracts for future delivery of other grains and soybeans also extended their weather-related advance. With the winter wheat crop in need of a good soaking to finish off its critical heading stage before harvest, wheat traders are worried that a continuing run of dry weather could do enough damage to significantly decrease yields, analysts said. Weekend weather forecasts were mixed and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> called for normal to below-normal rainfall across the country for the first half of next week. Corn and soybean prices also ran up sharply early in the day but retreated on profit taking after contracts for May delivery expired at noon. But wheat prices remained firm through the close. `` I think the wheat market is beginning to take on a life of its own,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It has n't really been in an uptrend like corn and soybeans and there's some concern about the condition of the crop in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Survey: Non-Residential Electricity Rates Fell In Year Ended April
30</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial and industrial electric users enjoyed fractionally cheaper rates in the year ended April 30, their foreign counterparts were mostly paying more, a consulting firm said Thursday. In its annual study, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the nation's 24 largest investor-owned utilities charged their non-residential customers an average 6.28 cents per kilowatt-hour over the 12-month period, compared with 6.29 cents a year earlier. That slight decrease compared with an overall inflation rate of 3.9 percent over the same period, the firm said. `` Price reductions by some utilities could be attributed to the recent decline in oil prices,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauterbach </PERSON>, executive vice president of the Park Ridge, N.J.-based firm. But <PERSON> Lauterbach </PERSON> warned that the apparent stability masked an upward price movement by half of the utilities surveyed. `` Some of these increases are a direct result of having industrial and commercial users offset the costs incurred in the building of nuclear power plants,'' he said. `` Most of these nuclear power plants still lack a license to operate.'' Looking to other countries, the firm found that electricity costs also fell in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, by 4.87 percent, and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, by 1.98 percent. That compared with inflation rates of 2.5 percent and 0.96 percent, respectively. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the average cost remained constant, while inflation rose by 2.4 percent, the organization said. Countries where businesses paid more for electricity, with percentages of increases and national inflation rates were: _ <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 8.7 percent, 4.1 percent _ <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, 5.9 percent, 6.8 percent _ <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, 5.5 percent, 3.5 percent _ <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, 4.6 percent, 5.4 percent _ <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 3.17 percent, 4.9 percent _ <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, 1.1 percent, 0.5 percent _ <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 0.2 percent, 0.8 percent <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is an international utility cost-consulting firm with offices in 12 nations.

<HEAD>Exxon Announces Earnings Upswing At Annual Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest oil company, entered this year on a `` definite earnings upswing'' despite two years of severe oil price volatility and market disruptions, Chairman <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said Thursday at the company's annual meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s net income of $ 1.46 billion for the first quarter of 1988 was up 36 percent over the first quarter of 1987, even though average crude oil prices in this year's first quarter were about $ 2 a barrel lower than the first quarter last year, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said. `` The effect of these declining oil prices on our exploration and production earnings was cushioned somewhat by increased production from new and existing fields,'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said of the New York-based corporation. `` More importantly, however, petroleum product prices _ both here and abroad _ were relatively firm.'' Firm prices helped improve margins in <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s refining and marketing sectors, said <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON>, who added that the company also profited from sharp production increases in its chemical operations. `` After two consecutive years of record earnings, chemicals began this year with the best quarterly earnings ever,'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said. The company last month reported first quarter earnings of $ 1.06 per share, up 41 percent over the first quarter of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 1.8 billion in 1987 to acquire producing oil and gas properties in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the company plans to continue investment in high-quality, attractively priced reserves, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said. In an effort to make exploratory drilling ventures more cost-effective, the company is concentrating on a select group of high-quality prospects _ a policy that led to significant discoveries last year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said. `` This success,'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said, `` has encouraged us to budget an increase from 184 to about 240 exploratory wells this year.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> also invested about $ 524 million in overall research and development last year, including research into new generation synthetic fuel technologies, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said. He said the research will allow <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to take advantage of its sizeable holdings of coal, oil shale and other resources. `` Continuing to operate in a very difficult and uncertain business environment requires us to continue improving our efficiency and keep a sharp eye on near-term performance,'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said. `` We must look further out and invest in those emerging technologies that are essential for our company's long-term growth and profitability.''

 Flamboyant financier <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, now chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is the target of major <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and federal grand jury investigations for possibly violating a litany of securities laws, a published report said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> said that documents it obtained and interviews conducted with business associates show <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> may have engaged in such crimes as insider trading, tax fraud, filing false documents with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and `` parking'' stock in accounts that conceal its ownership. The investigations stem from the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading scandal. The Journal also said new details of possible securites law violations surfaced in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit filed last week against <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBartolo </PERSON>, Sr.. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, an eccentric high school dropout who amassed a fortune through real estate, stock market speculation and takeover raids, used a number of possibly illegal tactics to `` force large corporations into unwanted takeovers or liquidations that gained him hundreds of millions of dollars,'' the Journal said A spokesman at Singer headquarters said <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> had no comment on the Journal report. In one case early on in his takeover career, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> secretly purchased and parked 58,000 shares of H.H. <ORGANIZATION> Robertson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> construction company he said he would acquire for $ 250 million, the Journal said. But <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> never followed through with a formal bid and did not file any documents detailing his offer with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, as required by law, the paper said. In the process, the Journal said, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> alienated <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s wealthy <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON> family, which owned 17 percent of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> also reneged on an agreement to buy back the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> shares he parked at <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, leaving the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> securities firm with a $ 250,000 loss, the paper said. Later, however, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> partly reimbursed <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, and then sent the firm two phony invoices for $ 75,000 each when he leared the firm had recouped a good portion of the loss on its own, the Journal said. In his next deal, the paper said, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> raider secretly enlisted the aid of the DeBartolo in his bid for <ORGANIZATION> Cluett </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> documents do not reveal any links between the two, but the Journal said <PERSON> DeBartolo </PERSON> bought large blocks of <PERSON> Cluett </PERSON> stock for himself and arranged for others to buy more, sometimes after talking with <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> The Journal said documents indicate <PERSON> DeBartolo </PERSON> lent <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> millions of dollars to purchase <PERSON> Cluett </PERSON> shares. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> and his investor group walked away with $ 82 million after <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> surfaced as a `` white knight'' and bought <PERSON> Cluett </PERSON>. The paper also said <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> had an arrangement with <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> that the firm would buy stock in <ORGANIZATION> Hammermill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, his next target, and hold it for him to buy at a later date. Between Jefferies and his own purchases, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>'s stake totaled more than 5 percent, though he did not report it to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> as required by law, the Journal said. An hour before <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> launched a $ 900 million bid for Hammermill, he purchased an additional 1.7 million shares, the paper said. The Journal noted that <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> did not report he was again working with <PERSON> DeBartolo </PERSON>, who was amassing his own block of Hammermill shares. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> and his group made $ 54 million when <PERSON> Hammermill </PERSON> was rescued by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The paper said <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> parked at least 800,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> in late 1986. To realize a $ 500,000 profit when the stock rose in price, he sent <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> an invoice for consulting services payable on Jan. 2, 1987, in an attempt to defer the gain for tax purposes, the paper said. The Journal noted that <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> severed all relations shortly after Nov. 12, 1986, when the government's investigation into insider trading violations swung into high gear In March 1987, <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, chairman of the investment firm, agreed to settle <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> charges, pleaded guilty to two felonies and agreed to cooperate. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> then began investigating the transactions involving <ORGANIZATION> Cluett </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hammermill </ORGANIZATION> and other companies that <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> had a hand in, the Journal said. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> acquired Singer in a $ 1.06 billion hostile bid on the heels of the stock market crash, putting him at the helm of one of the nation's oldest corporations.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of several major Wall Street investment firms to cut back on program trading, said Thursday it will reconsider the move after a government official said such restrictions could destabilize the market. Bear <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> went further than four other investment firms when it announced last week it would not only stop index arbitrage trading for its own accounts but for those of customers as well. <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> halted index arbitrage for their own accounts amid concern that the popular form of program trading was at least partly responsible for the stock market's volatility. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said Thursday that excessive restriction of index arbitrage would limit market liquidity and tend to destabilize the market. In testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that `` insufficient arbitrage between cash and futures can be a destabilizing force in a declining market.'' In index arbitrage, traders use computers to buy or sell baskets of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to help them profit from brief price discrepancies. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> noted that `` reduced arbitrage implies less connection between cash and futures markets and more price disparities across these markets.'' Partly citing those comments, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bear </PERSON> <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON>' chairman and chief executive officer, said the firm would `` re-examine its position on index arbitrage. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bear </PERSON> <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> had been `` monitoring closely the action and the liquidity problems of the stock market for the past week.'' He also pointed to other firms' `` suspension of index arbitrage activity for themselves but -LRB- continuation of -RRB- those activities for customers'' as further reason for the firm to re-evaluate its position. `` If we do decide to re-enter index arbitrage, we will consider limiting our activities to buying on a downtick and attempting to sell on an uptick in the stocks involved,'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said in a statement.

He said technical factors dominated the session's activity, rather than any specific news.

<HEAD>Congressional Committee Looks at Northrop Payments in Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A congressional subcommittee is trying to determine if $ 6.5 million <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> invested in a hotel project in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was actually intended to influence sales of the company's ill-fated F-20 jet fighter, a committee aide said Thursday. A <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> spokesman denied any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices act, and portrayed the company a victim of fraud by its Korean partner in the deal. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> has filed a fraud suit against the Korean company, which was its partner in a 50-50 joint venture to build a hotel in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON>, a spokesman at the company's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> never began commercial production of the F-20 because it failed to win sufficient orders. The probe by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on investigations focuses on <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s payment of $ 6.5 million in 1984 to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Culture Travel Co.. <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON> said the payment was part of a so-called offset program in which the company was to invest in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s economy in return for receiving the fighter Such arrangements are common among aerospace companies dealing with developing countries and are allowed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. The committee, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., is probing whether the payment was intended to buy influence rather than build a hotel, said a subcommittee staff member who refused to be identified It would be a violation of the Corrupt Practices Act if the company meant the money as payment to individuals. One aspect of the arrangement that aroused suspicion, the <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> aide said, was that the money intended for the development company was deposited in a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> bank account. `` We were defrauded by a group of people in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON> said. `` We tried and tried again to get that hotel under way and when it became evident that the hotel was n't going to be built we filed for arbitration, and then we filed this suit.'' The suit, filed in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in December 1987, accuses the <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and 12 individuals of defrauding the company. The committee also is probing <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s payment of $ 1.5 million to terminate an agreement with a Korean company that was supposed to help it market the jet in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The committee staff has questioned the size of January 1984 payment to the <ORGANIZATION> Dong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> because the agreement did n't bring any sales, the <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> aide said. <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON> declined to comment on the <PERSON> Dong </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> agreement.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is looking for ways to improve profits on its auto business without sacrificing sthe market share it gained by holding down prices and offering aggressive buyer incentives, Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> told shareholders Thursday. `` We are in a real dog fight in this market,'' Iacoccasaid. `` We intend to price as aggressively as we have to. Our goal is market share ... We want all the ground we can take.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> increased its share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vehicle market to 14.5 percent at the end of April from 13.3 percent a year ago while industry leader <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> continued to lose market share. The No. 3 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker pushed up its share by keeping its prices the lowest among the Big Three company and offering `` the biggest rebates and incentives the world has ever known,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. The pricing strategies and continuing expenses from <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s August acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have pushed down profits A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> contract ratified last week will put further pressure on earnings. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has increased spending on new product research and development by 25 percent, or $ 150 million, in 1988 _ a necessary expense for updating its cars and trucks with new engines and transmissions in the 1990s. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s immediate capital spending on new products and facilities will be about $ 2.8 billion in 1988, nearly even with $ 3 billion in 1987, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> predicted <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> would earn more in the second quarter than the $ 183.7 million it earned in the first quarter, but would not do as well as analysts are projecting because of costs including continuing incentives. `` I ca n't tell you how long it will be before we can do something to improve our profit margins _ that is, without giving up any of the market share we've taken,'' he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON>, president of product and marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s core automaking business, said Thursday <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is looking at increasing prices in 1989 to improve profits. `` At some point in time you reach a point of diminishing returns'' selling cars and trucks by offering rebates on top of low prices, <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON> said. For example, the Dodge Aries and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reliant </ORGANIZATION> are <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s best-selling cars But Chrysler is selling them as part of its <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> series with a $ 6,995 base price and more standard equipment than in previous years and including the cars in its rebate campaign. `` That does n't leave much on the table,'' <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will replace the K-car after 1989 with the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acclaim </ORGANIZATION>, a bigger, more modern version of the same car that goes on sale in January. Despite intense conflict between <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and its 66,000 <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> workers in the months before and during negotiations on the new two-year contract, only a handful of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> representatives other than President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> _ a member of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s board _ attended the meeting. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, an official with <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 624 at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s New Process Gear plant in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, was assured by <ORGANIZATION> Iacocca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> does not plan to sell any of its <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary plants beyond the four already announced _ three in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area and one in <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> wound up in early contract negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> because it entertained a $ 2 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION>, which includes the <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> plant. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> turned down the offer after workers threatened to cripple the company with plant-by-plant strikes. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> had underestimated `` how strongly our employees felt about remaining part of this <PERSON> Chrysler </PERSON> family.''

<HEAD>Dollar Drifts Lower; Gold Rises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar drifted lower Thursday against most major currencies except the West German mark and the British pound in a sluggish market weighed down by continued concern about inflation and interest rates. Gold prices edged higher. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid price for gold of $ 455.70 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 455.50 late Wednesday. Traders said the foreign exchange markets lacked conviction about the dollar's likely direction in the near term. A rally sparked by Tuesday's positive government report on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade performance in March came to a halt Wednesday, and the markets have been casting about for new signals. `` After the trade deficit -LRB- report -RRB-, people are resting on their laurels,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, a currency dealer at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. The currency markets have caught the inflation anxiety gripping the stock and bond markets, traders said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has refrained in recent days from aggressively seeking to push interest rates higher. Many dealers expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to drive interest rates higher in an effort to rein in inflation. Fears of renewed inflation were aggravated Tuesday by the March trade figures and a report that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factory use increased in April. A move by the central bank toward higher interest rates would tend to bolster the dollar. `` Certainly, people are looking for more movement from'' the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Broyd </PERSON>, vice president of foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.73 Japanese yen to a closing 124.80 yen. Traders described the decline as a correction to the dollar's earlier rally Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar edged up to 124.87 yen. By the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar settled at 124.86 yen, down from 124.93 yen late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.8665, more expensive for buyers than $ 1.8605 late Wednesday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound retreated to $ 1.8635 from $ 1.8675 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.7017 West German marks, up from 1.7007; 1.4177 Swiss francs, down from 1.4182; 5.7540 French francs, down from 5.7575; 1,262.00 Italian lire, down from 1,263.50; and 1.2427 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2463. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6990 West German marks, down from 1.7055; 1.4155 Swiss francs, down from 1.4215; 5.7542 French francs, down from 5.7700; 1.9042 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9090; 1,262.00 Italian lire, down from 1,265.50; and 1.2442 Canadian dollars, up from 1.24125. Dealers said a rush to buy soybeans by commodity dealers in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> helped boost gold prices. Higher prices for the beans following dry weather in the plains states threaten to cause an increase in food prices and inflation and thus make gold _ a favorite hedge against inflation _ more desirable. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold was quoted at a late bid price of $ 456.90 a troy ounce, up from $ 453.70 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the bid price for gold was $ 458, up from $ 454 late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 3.02 to close at a bid price of $ 457.56. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery settled at $ 457.40 a troy ounce, up from $ 457.30 late Wednesday. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid of $ 6.72 a troy ounce, up from late Wednesday's $ 6.58. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver for current delivery settled at $ 6.612 a troy ounce, down from $ 6.685 late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Money Supply Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in early May, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 cracked the $ 3 trillion mark, rising $ 3.3 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,000.9 billion in the week ended May 9 from $ 2,997.6 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased $ 4.5 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,773.7 billion from $ 3,769.2 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell $ 7.2 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 769.1 billion from $ 776.3 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 2,974.7 billion, an 8.7 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,746.5 billion, up 8.1 percent, while M1 rose 5.5 percent to an average of $ 765.2 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks fell $ 506 million in the week ended May 11, compared with a gain of $ 1.65 billion a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> averaged $ 406 million, up from $ 349 million _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said net free reserves totaled $ 584 million in the two weeks ended Wednesday, down from $ 621 million in the previous two weeks _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 275.5 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, down from $ 276.5 billion two weeks earlier

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Jump As Dryness Prompts Yield Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices bounded higher Thursday amid increasing fears that disease and drought could significantly reduce yields from the rapidly maturing winter wheat crop. Other grain futures also moved higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and soybean futures finished mixed. On other markets, cattle futures were sharply lower while pork futures were mixed; precious metals were mixed; energy futures and stock-index futures advanced. With the winter wheat crop in need of a good soaking to finish off the maturation process before harvest, wheat traders were worried that a continuation of the recent dry weather could do enough damage to cut yields, analysts said. Weekend weather forecasts were mixed and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> called for normal to below-normal rainfall across the country for the first half of next week. In addition to weather problems, reports have surfaced of disease damage to wheat in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Although most of the wheat crop has been reported in good condition, concerns about potential damage have become strong enough that `` the wheat market is beginning to take on a life of its own'' instead of following the corn and soybean trends, <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON> said. Indeed, corn and soybean prices also ran up sharply early in the day but retreated on profit-taking after grain contracts for May delivery expired at noon. Wheat prices remained firm right through the close. `` The wheat is in the heading stage, when it normally does need a good rain to finish off the crop and ensure good yields,'' <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON> said. `` So the wheat may be trading on some dryness of its own.'' Wheat settled 8 -LCB- cents to 11 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.42 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 3 cents higher with July at $ 2.16 a bushel; oats were 2 -RCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.72 \ a bushel; soybeans were 2 \ cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ The early runup in grain prices had a strong negative impact on cattle futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Higher grain prices would mean higher feed prices and narrower profit margins for cattle producers, which could ultimately lead to higher beef prices and a corresponding drop in demand for beef, analysts said. `` The threat of higher feed costs in the future and the potential for tighter supplies of feed grains ... certainly threw some indecision into the live cattle futures,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON>, market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> AgriVisor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, Ill. In addition, hot weather is drying up the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> ranges, which could force early sales of cattle to feedlots and boost supplies of market-ready animals, <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON> said. The weakness in the cattle futures carried over into the neighboring pork pits but expectations of a seasonal drop in hog supplies limited losses and helped hog futures close on a mixed note, he said. Live cattle were .20 cent to .87 cent lower with June at 73.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .62 cent to 1.23 cents lower with May at 80.65 cents a pound; hogs were .17 cent lower to .42 cent higher with June at 53.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .80 cent lower with May at 53.05 cents a pound. The precious metals markets also were watching grain prices, especially soybean prices, which are considered a rough indicator of inflation, analysts said. Gold futures on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> hit their highs early in the day, then sold off as soybean prices fell, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The profit-taking was more pronounced in the silver market, where futures prices settled sharply lower following a strong rally on Wednesday. Gold settled 20 cents lower to 10 cents higher with June at $ 458.20 a troy ounce; silver was 7.3 cents to 7.5 cents lower with May at $ 6.612 a troy ounce. Energy futures edged higher in dull trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 34 cents higher with June at $ 17.45 a barrel; heating oil was .08 cent lower to .56 cent higher with June at 47.63 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .07 cent to .25 cent higher with June at 52.30 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures posted modest gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.80 points higher at 252.90.

 Stocks barely broke a two-day losing streak Thursday in a partial recovery that traders attributed to bargain shopping and slightly eased tension over inflation, but the outlook on Wall Street remained bleak. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 56.54 points on Tuesday and Wednesday and dropped another 25 points in early trading, rebounded and finished up 7.63 points to 1,958.72. Broader market indices were mixed. To a large degree, the Dow average's behavior echoed movements in the bond market, which in turn echoed movements in the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> index, a key measure of inflation that tracks commodity futures prices in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The CRB index rose sharply in the morning, heightening inflation fears, raising yields in the bond market and depressing stock prices as bonds became a more attractive alternative to stocks. The CRB index later retreated when soybean futures weakened, easing bond yields and helping the stock market rise. `` The funny thing is how the market is so tuned to inflation, it turned on the commodity price index, which was turned on and off on soybeans,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This shows how graphically the stock market has become a commodity business,'' <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said. `` We're subject to the vagaries of traders in the pits of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' Some traders said eased yields in the bond market was viewed as a reason by some investors to buy selected well-known stocks that had fallen over the previous two sessions, making them potential bargains. But they said any more indications of higher inflation likely would weaken stocks again. One possibly destabilizing figure was the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer price index for April, to be released Friday morning. `` The market is fragile enough to react very negatively to almost any figure,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthel </PERSON>, strategist for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market is seeing the bogeyman when it comes to inflation.'' Others said they saw little reason to be optimistic about the market, which has been ignoring signs of economic health that defy the dire predictions issued after the crash seven months ago. `` What we're seeing now are apathetic investors who are using economic news to get out of stock market,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DaPuzzo </PERSON>, manager of retail equities at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The whole thing now is negative psychology.''

<HEAD>Irving Asks Fed To Reconsider Bank of NY Approval</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider the conditional approval of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile takeover bid, in light of a proxy vote that retained <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board of directors. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> is backing a merger with the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second largest bank. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> should be required to file a new application for approval due to changes it proposed for the takeover bid. For one thing, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> noted, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> offered to raise the stock portion of its bid to 1.675 <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> shares from 1.575 shares, adding $ 3.20 per share to the deal and pushing its value to around $ 1.2 billion. The offer, which includes $ 15 in cash, would be amended only if <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> agreed to a negotiated merger. In addition, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s subsequent threat to buy the Irving shares tendered to it if negotiations failed and operate the bank as a subsidiary were not in keeping with the approval by regulators in February. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it would buy the shares provided at least two-thirds of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s 18.5 million outstanding stock were tendered. But it also said it would run <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> separately to avoid activating the company's `` poison pill'' takeover defense. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> contends the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> did not approve `` a proposal by <ORGANIZATION> BNY </ORGANIZATION> to acquire a majority of <ORGANIZATION> IBC </ORGANIZATION>'s shares in the absence of a feasible plan for a prompt second-step merger of the two institutions.'' In a response, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> to reply to the issues <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> raised. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said, `` We consider the questions posed by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to be exactly what we expected.'' <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> is offering $ 75 a share for 9.5 million Irving shares, or about 51 percent of the stock outstanding, for a total of about $ 707 million. The bid is part of a complex restructuring plan that would include asset sales, cost-cutting measures and a $ 10-a-share special cash dividend.

<HEAD>Brazil Announces New Industrial Liberalization Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> on Thursday announced a plan to remove restrictions on imports and exports, and `` open <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> to international markets.'' The plan ends a decades-old policy of import-substitution, under which the government provided hefty fiscal incentives for companies that produced industrial goods previously found only on international markets. `` Our new industrial policy signals the democratization of Brazilian industry,'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> told journalists and government ministers. `` The country's new-found freedom had n't arrived in the industrial or economic sectors, they had n't felt the benefits of our new-found democracy.'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said the new measures would cut through thick Brazilian bureaucracy and clarify the government's position in the future. The measures would: _ Free up imports, with some exceptions Imports have been restricted to build the trade surplus and national industry, but now any company can buy most goods on international markets as long it pays hefty import dues. _ Revoke all fiscal incentives for industry, except in the area of technology Companies working in this area can receive tax cuts of up to 8 percent. _ Ease export of industrial goods, with less paperwork and less government control _ Create a five-minister commission to govern industrial policy Details of how the policy was to be implemented were to be worked out at a later date. `` The new policy will modernize <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and open the economy to international markets,'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said. Initial business response to the new measures that reversed a 40-year policy of government-led growth was favorable. `` Industry now has clear rules and freedom to grow with less government intervention,'' business leader <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beer </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globo </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest private network. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> returned to civilian government in March 1985, after 21 years of military rule.

<HEAD>Navistar Posts 49 Percent Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Strong demand for medium - and heavy-duty trucks boosted <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s second quarter profit by 49 percent from a year earlier, the truck manufacturer said Wednesday <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> posted net income of $ 70 million, or 24 cents a share, for the three months ended April 30. That compared with a profit of $ 47 million, or 15 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. Sales increased 13 percent to $ 1.05 billion from $ 930 million in the second quarter of 1987, the Chicago-based manufacturer stated. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> said workers at its <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, assembly plant have been working overtime due to strong demand. The company said it would increase its heavy truck production schedules by about 9 percent and its medium-duty truck production rates by 3 percent on Monday, and was exploring other options to further expand production. Increased industrial production and inter-city freight tonnage were important factors in <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>'s second-quarter performance, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotting </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive, stated. But higher prices for aluminum and steel cut into the company's profit margin, as did production phase-in costs at <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>'s new foundry in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and new paint plant in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cotting </PERSON> said Results included a $ 15 million gain from partial recovery of an Australian investment that had previously been written off. In addition, the results included a reduction in the carrying value of the company's investment in <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> preferred stock to $ 105 million from $ 120 million.
