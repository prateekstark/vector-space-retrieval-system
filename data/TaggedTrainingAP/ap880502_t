 City officials have asked for reports on whether police prevented Fire Department divers from joining the search for a victim trapped in a sightseeing helicopter that crashed and sank in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. A fire lieutenant was quoted as saying he had eight divers at the scene Sunday morning, but police kept them away at a time when only two police divers were in the water. It took 90 minutes to find the helicopter in the river's murk and free the trapped passenger, <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Oyama </PERSON>, a Japanese businessman. <PERSON> Oyama </PERSON>, 29, was taken to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he died nine hours later. The pilot and three other passengers, none seriously injured, escaped to the surface and were taken to hospitals. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> also said it would look into the issue of whether rescue was impeded by police-firefighter rivalry if it received information that such a dispute had occurred. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said two police divers were in the water by 10:37 a.m., 14 minutes after the first report of the crash. By 10:45, nine divers were conducting a pattern search of the area, he said. Fire Commissioner <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said two Fire Department divers were there at 10:37 and that eight were on the scene by 10:45. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> dismissed as a personal opinion an earlier statement by Fire Lt. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> 1 that the search was impeded because his divers were not allowed to join it. `` It was the feeling of the police commander on the scene and in fact the common practice of all experienced water rescuers that uncoordinated search teams in the water at the same time is dangerous and unproductive,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said in explaining why the <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s offer was declined. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said the rescue effort was `` within the purview of the Police Department and I have no problem with that. I do have a problem with reports saying we are not needed and unnecessary. Our feeling is that if resources were available, they should be utilized.'' Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he has asked for a report to `` find out whether all of the assistance on the scene was properly used.'' The mayor said he would not speculate before he got the information. In line with rules laid down by <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> last year to end jurisdiction disputes, police were in charge at Sunday's crash site, a non-fire emergency. The Fire Department calls the shots at fire emergencies. First Deputy Mayor <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezenoff </PERSON> said `` The only question is were there enough divers in the water'' to make the rescue without using fire divers. The crashed helicopter, a Bell Jet Ranger operated by <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, plunged from 1,400 feet after a 15-to-20-minute tour of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghiorsi </PERSON>, chief of the federal safety board's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, said particular attention would be given seat belts and the pontoons, which separated from the craft on impact. <PERSON> Oyama </PERSON> was snarled in his belt and had to be cut free, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivadeneyra </PERSON>, one of divers who found the helicopter in 35 feet of water.

 Image is everything in the rough-and-tumble world of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> politics, says Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. But after four months surrounded by the trappings of power, he admits his image is n't what it should be. His enemies gripe about his willingness to reward friends. And his friends gripe about his unwillingness to punish enemies. `` I might become a little more aggressive, harder than I used to be, but that's because the job will make me so,'' the soft-spoken mayor said during a recent interview. `` Everything you do or say in this office is political, or somebody will couch it that way and force you to respond in a political manner. You try to be a statesman, but hey, you better be a politician, too,'' he added. `` Otherwise you wo n't be around very long.'' `` People have all kinds of plans for you, and I just say that if I'm going to make a mistake, it will be one I made myself, not something that somebody suggested to me,'' said <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, 58. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> became embroiled in a new controversy this weekend when religious leaders accused mayoral community liaison aide <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON> of repeatedly using racial and religious slurs against Jews and Christians in a series of tape-recorded lectures to followers of Nation of Islam leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>. Mayoral spokesman <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> planned to ask <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON>, 35, to `` tune down his rhetoric,'' but did not plan to fire him. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> became mayor following the death in November of <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who became the city's first black mayor in 1983 and had consolidated his power over the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had served only eight months of his second term and <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> must at some point face an election if he wants to stay in office. But the date of the next mayoral election is up in the air. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> ruled last week that an election would be held in 1989 if City Clerk <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozubowski </PERSON> declared the mayor's office vacant. <PERSON> Kozubowski </PERSON> said he would n't do so unless ordered by a court. His opposition virtually assures the controversy will be resolved in court. Already, competing lawsuits arguing for either a 1989 or 1991 election are pending. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> has said he is prepared to run whenever the next election is scheduled. No matter what the date, observers say, the absence of a political giant like <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> will show how splintered this city's once-vaunted Democratic machine has become. `` There'll be so many people running _ black, white, green ... that nobody will know what to do,'' said black activist <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, credited with organizing the grass-roots campaign that elected <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to his first term. `` And there's scores of people talking about running for everything from dogcatcher to mayor and nobody's got the power to tell them no,'' he continued. `` Machines move with precision. If there was a chief like <PERSON> Harold </PERSON>, things would still be done with precision,'' he said. `` But now you've got a lot of little chieftains and everybody's throwing things in the way.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> has had a difficult time shouldering the mantle since he was elected by a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> coalition made up mostly of white, anti-Washington aldermen. `` Some people were with <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> because they believed in him, some because they feared him and some because he proved he could win,'' said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` Everybody knew there would be some slippage after he died,'' added <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, `` but nobody knew how much.'' The coalition that put <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> in office already has shown a tendency to fray at the seams. His bloc held together long enough to pass <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s record budget, but grumbling set in almost immediately afterward and many of <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s legislative proposals are languishing in the council. And during the primary elections in March, several black aldermen who were among <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s most identifiable supporters got clobbered in races for party committeeman positions. Normally, aldermen are shoo-ins for those posts. `` What that told me is that the voters in my ward do n't like him,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Beavers </PERSON>, one of the aldermen, `` and they may not be crazy about me standing behind him either.''

<TEXT>
 Welfare officials celebrating the first anniversary of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s workfare program say they've shown that even the nation's poorest state can take those who have never had a steady job or who have n't worked in years off the dole. While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> debated the most comprehensive welfare reform bill in 50 years, <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> officials lauded their program for turning workfare jobs into paying employment for 109 of the 765 food stamp recipients participating so far. Welfare recipients, they said, may be pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps largely because of the state's poverty. `` We're not distressed by the current economic situation. In fact, I get a personal kick from trying to do more with less,'' Welfare Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> has the lowest per capita income in the nation at $ 10,204; 20 percent of its residents rely on food stamps. `` A lot of people, including some who work here in this department, said workfare ca n't work in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> recalled. `` The reasons they gave me for that is it's a rural-based state, that we have high unemployment.'' But <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said he knew workfare could work in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> because, although local governments and private non-profit groups were short of revenue for needed services, there were `` tremendous numbers of people on welfare who in my opinion were able to work.'' <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON>, a regional food program specialist in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> office, agreed that <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s poverty has contributed to its workfare success. `` I do n't know that this would have worked so well in some other place,'' <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> said of the program, which requires clients to work for government the number of hours times the minimum wage that equals the value of their food stamp allotment. She said because so many <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> agencies ca n't afford to hire people to perform necessary tasks they'll give workfare participants doing those jobs more responsibility and training than they would otherwise. She also noted that <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> workfare participants can more easily be recommended to private industry as solid, proven employees because they work an average of six months before <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> personally presents their resumes at a meeting of local business owners and managers in their community. <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> said that with 16 counties participating so far, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> probably has the largest-scale food stamp workfare program in the Southeast. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said he hopes to include all of the state's 82 counties within a few years. Each county's board of supervisors must opt to join <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s version of the federally authorized program. Participating counties pay $ 12.50 monthly to cover each workfare client's travel and other miscellaneous expenses, with the federal government matching that amount. Food stamp recipients in participating counties must sign up for workfare, Job Find or educational programs. In the past year, 1,972 of 5,448 clients in the participating counties opted to discontinue receiving food stamps rather than meet the requirements of one of the three options. Forty-four states have a workfare program tied to the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, according to federal officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Among the workfare success stories provided by <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> is the case of <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a longtime unemployed off-shore oilfield worker. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> began his workfare assignment as a novice in the Welfare Department's printing office. His workfare training later allowed him to select from among several print shop job offers _ at what he said is a livable salary. `` It's something when your children say, ` I want this and I want that, Daddy,''' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` Now, I ca n't get everything they want, but I get everything they need and some of the things they want.''

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Except for the thunder of aircraft taking off and the showers of flares overhead, Soviet soldiers serving at a base near <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport could almost convince themselves they are in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The corrugated metal huts and wooden barracks are typical of bases in their native land. Beside each cot in the bunkhouses are tubes of Soviet toothpaste, Soviet soap and Soviet mirrors, purchased at the base store. Russian women like <PERSON> Oksana </PERSON> <PERSON> Okulova </PERSON> serve breakfast, lunch and dinner to the soldiers on Soviet crockery. Afterward, the women wash up while the men go off to train Afghan government troops and help them defend the city against attack by anti-communist rebels. The hearty breads cherished by Soviets are baked at the base each day, and familiar foods like ham, cheese and apples are flown in for the soldiers, who eschew the spicy Afghan dishes. But the flares, which are released by aircraft to deflect heat-seeking Stinger missiles, serve as a reminder that the soldiers are in danger, even inside the closely guarded confines of the base. `` Of course it's dangerous flying here,'' <PERSON> Tiit </PERSON> <PERSON> Tommela </PERSON>, an army major from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, told visiting foreign journalists. `` We have to take precautions against your Stingers.'' Afghan guerrillas, who have been fighting the pro-Soviet government for 10 years, use the U.S.-supplied missiles effectively against government aircraft. Ms. <PERSON> Okulova </PERSON>, a 25-year-old who sought an escape from the industrial Russian city of <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>, said the aviation dangers are the only aspect of her life in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> she finds frightening. `` We hardly ever leave the base, so it's easy to just keep occupied and not think about the fact that there is a war going on,'' she said. `` We are forbidden to go to the markets, and when we go on touring trips we travel as a group.'' Officers refused to say how many soldiers serve at the sprawling complex that provides security for the capital, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and the aircraft serving it. It appears to house at least 1,000 Soviets. On Saturday, as the noon sun burst through rainclouds in the mountains ringing <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, a squad of Soviet paratroopers in camouflage jumpsuits lined up on the sports field to teach Afghans the art of hand-to-hand combat. Nearby, soldiers worked with two German shepherds trained to sniff out explosives hidden in items like canteens and matchboxes. `` There are occasional problems with the men,'' Ms. <PERSON> Okulova </PERSON> admitted when asked how she and several dozen other service workers deal with so many lonely soldiers far from home. But several factors limit the potential for romantic problems. Strict rules forbid intimate relationships, there is little privacy in the dormitories and barracks, and the women must work long hours, Mrs. <PERSON> Okulova </PERSON> said. The Soviets plan to start pulling out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15, under an accord signed last month in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. However, the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> base may be one of the last closed by the Soviets. Because there is no firm exit date, the soldiers at the base have a business-as-usual attitude, although they admit to being eager to return home. `` We will go when we are told to go,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON> of the Ukrainian city of <LOCATION> Kharkov </LOCATION>. `` Everything here is normal for the time being, although we are of course happy that a settlement has been reached in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.'' Soviet soldiers intervened in December 1979 to support the government, and about 115,000 remain in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In keeping with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s official contention that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s army is now strong enough to defend the country without <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> fighting power, the soldiers had high praise for the forces loyal to President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> `` They will resolve their own problems,'' said <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarelkin </PERSON>, a paratrooper from the Russian city of <LOCATION> Ivanovo </LOCATION>. He was one of several decorated heroes turned out in full parade uniform Saturday for the benefit of the visitors. `` The Afghan army is young, but it should be able to defend itself.'' Some Western observers here expect the rebel forces based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to move north and take control of parts of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as the Soviets retreat. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s regular army numbers only about 40,000 soldiers, many of them underage conscripts likely to flee if government positions becomes indefensible.

 The top aide to a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> congressman jumped to his death from a hotel window Sunday after <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported he had made bizarre demands of male staff members, including asking one to do a striptease. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, 46, chief assistant to Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, fell 18 stories to a seventh-floor roof of the Helmsley Palace Hotel, said police spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. The death appeared to be a suicide, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> left a note on hotel stationery, he said, but he declined to disclose its contents. The Post article quoted former staff members as saying <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> had ceded control of his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office to <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>. The newspaper said <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> used money from <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s re-election campaign to recruit for a company <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> owned, offering salaries up to $ 50,000 for single young men, then coerced them to socialize with him. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, a 39-year-old Democrat, was registered in a different room from Pappas Sunday at the hotel, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. The congressman was interviewed by detectives, who would not comment on the questioning. A hotel operator said a <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> was registered but was not answering his phone. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, unseating Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON>, a conservative Republican who was caught in a scandal when the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported he was seen in public with young male prostitutes. The Post's front-page article about <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> Sunday came as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigates allegations his campaign disclosure reports concealed $ 6,650 in payments to <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, paid $ 72,200 as <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s administrative assistant last year, also owns a company, <ORGANIZATION> Pappenbauer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, that received $ 119,642 in fees and expenses since 1980, a revised <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> campaign reports shows. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON>, Republican chairman in <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s district, told the Easton -LRB- Md. -RRB- Star-Democrat he filed the complaint that led to the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> investigation, but it was the Post that had raised questions about sexual discrimination and what <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON> called `` the apparently established preference for young males in the recruiting and hiring practices.'' The newspaper quoted <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> staff members as saying <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> told one male employee that he would have to perform a striptease at a 1987 office retreat. The unidentified aide refused. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Ourth </PERSON>, was quoted as saying that when he was recruited to be <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s press secretary in December 1986 he was told he could not date for a year and should devote all his time to the office. Ourth quit within six months. The article also quoted <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hira </PERSON>, 22, a special assistant to <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, as saying he was fired for refusing to stay at a party in <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> hotel suite last November, after <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> announced he would run for re-election in 1988. Fellow staff member <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> quit because of similar demands, <PERSON> Hira </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The newspaper quoted a memo from <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> dated Nov. 14 as saying, `` ... it is important for everyone on this staff to remember that <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> is the chief of staff, responsible for everyone's paycheck When he expresses a wish, however slight, it should be taken seriously.'' Those interviewed were quoted as saying they did not believe the pressure went beyond attending dinners and parties organized by <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>. Former aides also were quoted as saying <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> excluded female staff members from his social activities. The newspaper said <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> issued a statement saying <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s office `` has been run in an efficient and well-structured manner The office has been managed in a way which has served the people of the 1st Congressional District of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> well for many years.'' Neighbors and former staff members told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> frequently stays at <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>' large frame house in <LOCATION> Accokeek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s residence is further south in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mary </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> called it `` The Dump.'' And in its current state, the apartment where she wrote much of `` Gone With The Wind'' shows the effects of care by those who, frankly, could n't give a damn. The three-story brick and stucco building sits in the middle of a muddy lot in midtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Its windows are broken or boarded, its roof is sunken and torn, its walls are sooty. But a group with $ 850,000 in financial backing wants to save the 74-year-old building, saying it represents possibly the last chance for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to properly honor one of its most celebrated residents. Developers, on the other hand, say `` The Dump'' ca n't be restored and should be razed to create a park to complement a recent flurry of construction in the neighborhood. Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, rented a first-floor apartment at what was then called <ORGANIZATION> Windsor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Apartments from 1926 to 1932. She was killed in a 1949 automobile accident 13 years after her epic novel of the Old South and Reconstruction was published. The fate of the building is in federal court. <ORGANIZATION> Trammell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which purchased the property in 1985, sued the city in January after Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> refused to sign a demolition permit for the apartment building. Young had said he would support demolition as a last resort, but the preservationist group came along and <PERSON> Young </PERSON> agreed to try to save the building. <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> had begun landscaping work around the building. Meanwhile, the group, <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is drumming up support for a Mitchell memorial project. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, president of the group, says most of the other <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> sites where Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> lived have been destroyed, leaving few physical reminders of the writer. ` This is one of our last opportunities,'' he said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said wants to restore the building to the way it was in Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s time, display the apartment where she did her writing and establish a writer-in-residence program. While previous attempts at `` Gone With The Wind'' attractions focused on the popular 1939 movie, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the apartment project would emphasize Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s book. `` We'd like to keep the literary aspect in the forefront,'' he said. The literary emphasis also would keep the project from becoming merely a tourist attraction, he said, though the lack of a major `` Gone With The Wind'' center in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is a major impetus for the effort. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the restoration effort has raised about $ 850,000 in cash, pledges and pledged services. He said it also has the endorsement from <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION>'s only remaining heirs _ two nephews. Among the opponents are those who were acquainted with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and say she would be against the memorial. `` I'm opposed to saving what she called ` The Dump' because <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> herself told me on several occasions that she wanted no museums or landmarks preserved in her memory,'' columnist <PERSON> Celestine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibley </PERSON> wrote recently in The Atlanta Constitution. But <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said there are many misconceptions about Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, and the project would offer a chance to clarify her background. And the recent announcement that a `` Gone With The Wind'' sequel is being written by a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> author will generate even more interest, he added. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, marketing principal at <PERSON> Trammel </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON>, said the developer sponsored two studies of the site before deciding that restoring the apartment was not feasible. One study, he said, found that the deterioration of the building was worse than expected. The other concluded that the funds needed for the project _ an estimated $ 2 million _ would not be available. If <PERSON> Trammel </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON>'s plans proceed, the park would have a historical marker designating the site as the location of Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s one-time residence, <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said. Any surviving or significant items from the building would be saved for inclusion in a possible traveling museum of `` Gone With The Wind'' memorobilia, he said.

 A new chocolate that wo n't melt in 90-degree temperatures has been developed in the high-technology kitchens of the Columbus-based <ORGANIZATION> Battelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman said. Food technologists at <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON>'s laboratory in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, are licensing rights to the new chocolate formulation, said laboratory spokesman <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vollerin </PERSON>. `` Chocolate should melt in your mouth at approximately 37 degrees Celsius -LRB- 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- but it should not melt or become fluid at outside temperatures at the same level,'' he said. The development would be a boon to candy distributors, who can not deliver chocolate during warm weather without expensive refrigerated trucks, and it could keep chocolate sales steady through the summertime and in hot-weather areas. <PERSON> Vollerin </PERSON> said consumers should not notice any difference in appearance or taste. There's no secret ingredient other than `` some traces of natural compounds,'' <PERSON> Vollerin </PERSON> said. `` It's the way we put them in. That's the secret. The process has been patented and licensed to a Japanese company for marketing in the Orient, and negotiations are under way for the licensing of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European rights, <PERSON> Vollerin </PERSON> said. If all goes well, test marketing could begin next year, he said. <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>'s food technology program also has developed new cookie-baking techniques that spare heat-sensitive fillings such as fresh fruit, nuts or chocolate chips, he said.

 Soviet scientists toasted their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleagues and then headed home after recording simulated low-yield nuclear bomb blasts that both sides said showed cheating on a test ban treaty could be detected. The successful weekend experiments in the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert and similar ones last September in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> used delicate seismographs to detect minuscule shock waves from the explosions of 10 - and 15-ton charges of dynamite, a fraction of the strength of most nuclear weapons tests, from as far as 400 miles away The experiments are expected to show that `` any chances for cheating are about excluded'' under a test ban, <PERSON> Evgeni </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and an adviser to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said Sunday. After seismometers detected the first detonation of 10 tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Archambeau </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado-Boulder </ORGANIZATION> geophysics professor, said the experiments mean `` that we can more accurately gauge the numbers and distribution of stations that will be required to verify a low-threshold treaty.'' <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, wearing a sweatshirt that said, `` Arms are for Hugs,'' called a comprehensive test ban `` very important. It is extremely important to stop the arms race.'' The Soviets offered toast with vodka and beer on May Day, a communist holiday. Scientists said they would turn to learning how to determine the difference between nuclear weapons detonations and industrial explosions by conducting more tests. <PERSON> Archambeau </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s seismic monitoring advisory committee, said he hoped both governments would sponsor further experiments The multimillion-dollar experiments in this country and in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were conducted by the council, a private group, and by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Archambeau </PERSON> and other scientists in the project had been concerned that after the success of last year's research near the Soviet test site, efforts here might be thwarted by <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s fault-riddled geology, which soaks up sound waves He said he was relieved by the success of Saturday's final test. `` This is quite a strong signal. It's highly valuable,'' he said after a 15-ton explosion 100 miles east of <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Saturday sent seismic needles quivering at the joint U.S.-Soviet monitoring station in <LOCATION> Deep </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, 210 miles away. On Friday, 10 tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> were detonated beneath the desert 100 miles north of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and another 10-ton shot was set off 50 miles south of the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site. They were monitored at the joint station in Deep Springs, midway between <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, and at two permanent <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> installations closer to the Test Site 110 miles north of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, where all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> underground nuclear detonations are conducted. One hundred forty additional temporary monitoring stations were set up across <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Friday's first test barely moved the seismometers at <LOCATION> Deep </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> and the second was not detected, but both showed up on more sensitive digital instruments, said <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Eissler </PERSON>, research geophysicist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. She noted that a limited nuclear test ban treaty passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week forbids detonations larger than one kiloton, 100 times stronger than the 10-ton TNT blast. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, senior staff scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and a co-director of the test ban verification project, said the council had spent about $ 3.5 million on the effort since it began two years ago.

<TEXT>
 A wintry storm moved into <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sunday, piling snow up to a foot deep in and west of the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>, whipping winds to 60 mph and triggering a blinding dust storm blamed for two fatal traffic pileups. Strong thunderstorms struck parts of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Northwestern Wyoming got 8 inches of wet snow, closing the eastern and southern entrances to Yellowstone National Park in the morning. South of the park, 5 inches of snow was reported in <LOCATION> Moose </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, where wet snow accumulating on power lines caused some blackouts, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Up to 14 inches of snow was reported in the mountains and foothills of south-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Snow also was widespread over eastern sections of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Parts of eastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> got 5 inches of snow overnight. Up to 8 inches of snow was reported at <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, with 7 inches at the Snowbird ski resort and 5 inches at <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION>. In eastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, 50 mph winds spawned the dust storm, which dropped visibility to zero and caused the pileups on Interstate 70 near <LOCATION> Seibert </LOCATION> about 45 miles west of the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> border, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmstedt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. Two motorists were killed, and 17 people injured, authorities said. The incidents occurred in east - and westbound lanesof I-70 between <PERSON> Limon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seibert </PERSON> Nearly 45 miles of the highway was closed for more than two hours before visibility improved. High trucks and trailers were banned from Interstate 80 at <LOCATION> Wendover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, because of strong, gusty wind. <ORGANIZATION> Bryce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, reported gusts near 60 mph. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, winds gusted to 80 mph in <LOCATION> Ruidoso </LOCATION> and 60 mph in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ruidoso </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blanca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> was closed. The northern and central high Plains also had gusty wind, with gusts to more than 50 mph throughout the Dakotas and gusts to 60 mph in central <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Gunnison </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>. A day before, the difference in pressure between that storm and a high-pressure front 700 miles off the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> generated 65 mph wind in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, generating waves that destroyed a municipal pier and stranded 1,400 tourists on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` Whenever winds blow, it's due to a pressure difference, from high to low, just like water running downhill,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Grebe </PERSON> of the weather service. On Sunday, the body of a man believed to be a boater who jumped from a disabled craft in wind-tossed seas Saturday washed ashore near the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Lifeguard Sgt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hargett </PERSON>. Another man knocked off a boat five miles north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Saturday was missing Sunday, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Embleton </PERSON>. When the wind slammed 12-foot surf into the <LOCATION> Redondo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Municipal Pier on Saturday, a 155-foot section of the pier collapsed, said city spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. A restaurant also was damaged. An estimated 78,000 utility customers in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had power outages Saturday and some 1,400 tourists had to spend the night on <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> when the wind closed <LOCATION> Avalon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> to the boats that ferry island visitors. Hotels were full so tourists were sent to a local church. The pastor farmed people out to parishioners, a high school gym and a movie theater, said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsucker </PERSON>, administrative assistant at the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. Boats resumed running Sunday, she said. Strong thunderstorms rumbled across <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the Keys on Sunday, with three-quarter-inch hail and gusts up to 63 mph reported near Marathon and Conch Key. Elsewhere, central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> had light showers. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, posted a record low Sunday with a cool 43 degrees, four degrees off the former mark set in 1965. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 27 degrees at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> to 86 at <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The low for the day was 10 degrees at <LOCATION> Truckee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. For Monday, occasionally heavy snow was forecast over central and eastern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, south-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and the northern <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> Scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast from the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> into northwestern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Widespread showers were forecast across the northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> region, with scattered showers across northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Highs only in the 30s were predicted across much of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>; in the 40s and 50s from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> to the northern and central Rockies, and across central and northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>; in the 80s from central and eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> through the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> region to southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and in the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> deserts; in the mid 90s to 100 across inland areas of southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and in the 60s or 70s across much of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says seven years of charisma in the White House was enough, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be the first to acknowledge it's probably not a reference to him. `` You do n't know how hard it's been to keep my own charisma in check these past seven years,'' the vice president tells audiences, tongue in cheek. On one subject, both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who locked up the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination earlier this week, seem to agree. Both concede they are viewed as bland. And both insist it's fine with them. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` What's wrong with being a boring sort of guy?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: `` Maybe it's time for a little competence.'' Are <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> really that boring? No, say the candidates themselves, not really. Both say their wives do n't think so, either. Yes, says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sears </PERSON>, a political consultant who ran President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1976 campaign and the early part of his 1980 race. `` It's true at the moment. They're both saying they're managers. That sounds pretty boring. We're looking for leaders here,'' he said. In defense of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> adds: `` In terms of one's ability to compel deep feeling, the vice presidency is not an office in which you can gain that.'' In defense of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s campaign manager in 1984, says: `` It's a good example of a guy who understands his limitations and maximizes his assets He did n't try to make himself something he was n't.'' Neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been able to evoke the kind of passionate responses from audiences that, say, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or Democratic contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> do regularly. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has been known to scratch jokes out of prepared speeches. The vice president has a half dozen standard jokes he uses regularly, but sometimes he muffs the delivery. Both are widely viewed as pragmatists, not ideologues. And when talking about themselves, the two men likely to be rivals in the fall sound remarkably alike. `` People are not looking for a lot of pizazz out there. They're looking for someone who's stable, whose had some experience, a record of achievement, has values they can identify with ... Running for president is serious business.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>? No, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Here's <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: `` The fact is, after seven years of charisma, it's time for accomplishment and a record.'' Even when the candidates are insisting they really are n't all that boring, they sound alike. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` My wife does n't think that -LRB- I'm boring -RRB-. I do n't know about Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, what she thinks. Or Mrs. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. ... I think that I'm a scintillating kind of guy.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: `` People say I'm not a passionate guy. ... My wife thinks I'm passionate and so does <ORGANIZATION> Playgirl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>.'' The publication had put the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor on a list of best-dressed males. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also is fond of pointing out that the word charisma, like himself, is of Greek ancestry. He does n't usually elaborate, but the implication is that there must be a little charisma in him. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he does n't plan to change his image. He recently told reporters he wo n't `` kind of suddenly get my hair colored and dance up and down in a miniskirt or do something to show that I've got a lot of jazz out there and drop a bunch of one-liners.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a political analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, says both candidates are indeed boring _ and should leave it at that. Efforts to appear otherwise come off as sounding silly, <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> suggested. `` Boring politicians do pretty well in this country,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was pretty boring. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was boring. <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> seemed boring, at least in comparison with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>. And we elected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with a lot of reservations. He was too interesting. But he was elected because of our desperate desire for a change.'' With two boring candidates running, that personality trait should cancel itself out, <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> suggested. But are they equally boring? `` Between them? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a little more boring,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has more of a tendency to say foolish things. In that sense, he's not boring. But the only way for him to make himself not boring is by making himself into a joke.'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eizenstat </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s domestic affairs adviser, said a presidential candidate with charisma is `` the exception rather than the rule.'' `` In 1976, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> were not exactly accused of being charismatic candidates,'' <PERSON> Eizenstat </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Eizenstat </PERSON> said it may be too early to rule out the charisma factor entirely. `` Candidates take on a certain charisma, which will come out when they're anointed as nominees of their parties, they may not have now. All the hoopla of national conventions invests people with a certain halo effect.'' In any event, <PERSON> Eizenstat </PERSON> said he personally does n't find either <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> boring. Dull, perhaps, but not boring. `` I do n't, because what turns me on are public policy issues and people who are interested in discussing them.''

 The stakes in world-champion banana-split making got a bit higher _ er, longer _ thanks to the determined residents of this central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> town. Using 33,000 bananas, 2,500 gallons of ice cream and 150 gallons of chocolate syrup, <LOCATION> Selinsgrove </LOCATION> made a 4.5-mile-long banana split Saturday in a bid to regain a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. `` It's something for the town to say, ` When we work together, anything is possible,''' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoops </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Selinsgrove </LOCATION> teacher who organized the event to raise money for a community development organization. About 24,000 people standing and sitting in front of one-foot sections of the 12.6 million-calorie dessert dug in at 4:30 p.m. Each paid $ 2 for the privilege. `` It was getting pretty soupy after a while,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Linn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, who was standing near the middle of the giant split, made in three sections up Market Street through the center of this town of 5,500 residents. Selinsgrove set the record for the world's longest banana spilt in 1982 with a 1.5-mile concoction, winning a place in the 1983 Guinness Book. But in 1983, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> high school students created a banana split a tenth of a mile longer. <LOCATION> Selinsgrove </LOCATION> on Saturday outdid <ORGANIZATION> Zeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sorority </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Bowling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which created a 4-mile banana split in 1985, organizers said. A surveying company would verify the length of the banana split and send the results to <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>. Six hundred captains each produced 40-foot sections of the dessert, made in a cardboard trough from empty carpet rolls. In addition to the ice cream, bananas and chocolate sauce, organizers sprinkled on 600 pounds of chopped nuts, 150 gallons each of strawberries and pineapples and 24,000 cherries.

And they say it's an aphrodisiac.'' `` Honey and horseradish makes a good cough medicine,'' added his wife, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, 66. In addition to tasting recipes made with horseradish, some people participated in the Horseradish Olympics _ which included a root toss, where contestants tried to lob foot-long horseradish roots farther than anyone else, and a hot dog eating contest. The dogs, of course, were slathered with horseradish.

 A supporter of extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> is taking over the nation's second-largest local <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but concerned party members have stripped the post of most of its power and even its office. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> stunned <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> by winning election March 8 as chairman. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who was scheduled to take office today, blames his lack of clout within the party on `` Democratic elitists'' who he says are more concerned about their status than the party itself. `` There are some people in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that are n't being very democratic,'' he said The group's bylaws were changed by the party's 34-member steering committee three days after the election, when <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> narrowly defeated incumbent <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Veselka </PERSON>. The unanimous final approval of the bylaw changes came April 15 by the 664-member executive committee, made up of precinct chairmen. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> tried to thwart the vote, but a state district judge denied his request for a temporary restraining order. Embarrassed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders say <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was elected to the 2-year-old post by accident because of his common name and the race's obscurity. <PERSON> Veselka </PERSON>, an attorney, was unable to campaign in the weeks before the election because he was involved in a trial outside <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> says he won because he worked hard pushing <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> issues that `` finally hit a nerve.'' His election shocked party leaders, who face working under a chairman associated since 1975 with a perennial presidential candidate who claims the Queen of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> is involved in drug trafficking and has called for a quarantine of all AIDS patients. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Veselka </PERSON> defeated in 1986, said his sole occupation is working for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. He staffs solicitation booths the LaRouche organization sponsors at airports and other public places. <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, trails only <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' Cook County, which includes <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, in size as an election district <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> will send more delegates to the Democratic National Convention this summer than 17 states. When <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> assumes his limited duties, he'll have no office at the party's headquarters. Quarters that <PERSON> Veselka </PERSON> used are occupied by another staffer, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, the party's executive director. `` Mr. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> will have access to any records he needs. He just wo n't be able to come in and tell staffers what to do,'' <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' attorney, says the new bylaws prohibit his client from performing his statutory duties, such as record-keeping and handling the party's primary. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, the party's general counsel, counters that the chairman's duties under the law are to handle the county primary, which involves accepting applications and certifying the candidates. Under the old rules, the chairman raised funds for Democratic candidates in the district and largely determined how that money was spent. Now only the party's secretary and treasurer have access to the money. `` Not very many people are going to give money if <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> is in control,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> might not be able to deliver the votes or might not want to support a mainstream Democrat. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> also will have little power to set priorities for the local party. `` He will carry the title and preside over the meetings, but he wo n't set the agenda. He ca n't stray from the agenda, either,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said. For now, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he is n't sure of his plans except that he wants to bring more people into the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> during his term. His attorney says they have n't ruled out a possible return to court. Despite the squabbles, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> has done one good thing, says <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, a past county chairwoman: `` He has united the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials in suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s 5th Congressional District are stuck with a candidate they do n't want: a backer of political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. One official said party leaders were focusing on other campaigns when <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> backer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Houchins </PERSON>, a little-known candidate endorsed by the party, in Tuesday's congressional primary <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, a sales representative from <LOCATION> Drexel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, will face Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulze </PERSON>, a well-financed Republican, in November's election. <PERSON> Houchins </PERSON> has blamed his loss on the Democratic organization in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> counties, which make up the district, and on voters, whom he accused of ignorance. `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> could run for office and get elected,'' he said Friday. `` The county committees did not take <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> seriously, the area leaders did not take him seriously and the committee people did not take him seriously. ... So ultimately the voter did n't take the LaRouche threat seriously.'' Party leaders agreed. `` Of course, it's our party's responsibility and obviously we failed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlino </PERSON>. `` We should have exercised our maximum effort to promote <PERSON> Houchins </PERSON>.'' On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> called for <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> to step down to let a `` legitimate candidate run.'' <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said he would rather see <PERSON> Schulze </PERSON> win. `` It would be better than having a LaRouchian,'' he said. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, a perennial presidential candidate, has promoted a quarantine of AIDS victims and the colonization of Mars, and has charged that <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> is a drug dealer. He is on trial in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with six aides and five of his political groups on charges they conspired to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation. The grand jury was probing allegations that more than $ 1 million was raised for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign through credit card and loan fraud In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> said he openly identified himself with <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and won the election because of voters' dissatisfaction with mainstream Democratic candidates. But <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> and other Democrats contend that <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> concealed the affiliation. `` I do n't believe there was anything indicating he was a LaRouchian published by him. I think he was more surprised than other people that he even won,'' <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said. `` No one could even get a hold of him. I never saw him, I never met him, he was never at any meetings held by the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. I never received one phone call from him, not one piece of literature from him.'' <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> said he was in the streets daily `` talking face-to-face with people, talking about why they're trying to railroad <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, why they're trying to keep him out of politics.'' `` I told them what we've got to do to get the economy in shape. ... That's what people are interested in.'' Ms. <PERSON> Merlino </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> won because he was first on the ballot, the candidates' names were similar and the victor made misrepresentations. `` I did n't think the problem would be so big that we could n't overcome it in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' she said `` I should have done more. I should have been more aware.'' <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was the only one of the three that carried <PERSON> Houchins </PERSON>. Overall, <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> had 10,667 votes, or 53 percent, and <PERSON> Houchins </PERSON> had 9,298 votes, or 47 percent, with 99 percent of the vote counted. Democrats in the Republican stronghold were busy backing candidates in other races, Ms. <PERSON> Merlino </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Merlino </PERSON> said their committees will not back him.

<HEAD>Government Giving Indian Children Weak Education, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American Indian children educated in schools run by the federal government score worse on standardized tests than 79 percent of students nationwide, a new report says. The report is the first such compilation of test scores at schools run by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. It was compiled by the bureau itself and has been released to tribes and others for comment. The report blames many shortcomings on a lack of leadership _ sometimes actual lack of leaders, as shown by a 33 percent turnover rate among principals, use of acting directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> for five out of the past six years and 11 vacancies on the 40-person headquarters staff. Bureaucratic turf battles also contribute to the problems, it says. `` Collegiality, the act of putting aside vested interests and working for the good of the whole, is found in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best educational institutions but is often missing in the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> system, where administrators are sometimes more interested in shoring up and expanding their administrative domain,'' the report says. The 260-page document asks tribal leaders, school boards and others to consider an `` effective schools'' strategy including steps to hold <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> educators more accountable for their students' performance It also suggests expanded authority to waive Indian hiring preferences, and loans to educate prospective teachers that would be increasingly forgiven the longer the teachers stayed at work in a bureau school. The report says pressure to hire <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> teachers _ now 41 percent of the teaching staff _ means some are poorly trained and `` deficient in the basic reading, writing and mathematical skills they were expected to teach.'' Some of those checked for the study had failed state certification tests, which all teachers now are supposed to pass. `` Matters of budgets, personnel, facilities and other administrative tasks, rather than education itself, preoccupy too many principals,'' the report added. `` Some <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> teachers seem to begin with the expectation that their students will do poorly. ... Too many responsible officials in <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> education do not seek to lead but merely get by from day to day.'' The bureau educates 37,917 Indian students, about 10 percen of the nation's young Indians. About 30 percent attend boarding schools and about 30 percent are in schools run by tribes under contract with the bureau. The best schools barely approach average national scores. Overall the bureau's students ranked in the 21st percentile on standardized tests _ that is, they did worse than 79 percent of all children taking the test. Only one of the bureau's district offices had a single grade above the national median, the 50th percentile. The 27 second-graders of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION> district averaged in the 52nd percentile. Tribal leaders and school boards have had access to their own scores before, but the report provides the first opportunity for one tribe or area to compare its standing with another, said an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who discussed the document on condition that he not be identified. The worst scores were recorded in the <LOCATION> Chinle </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, where 202 fourth-graders and 154 fifth-graders, mostly from rural <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> families, wound up in the 7th percentile. The report highlights some success stories, but at the same time says the positive developments need to be pointed out more effectively to other schools and areas. For instance, the Dilcon and <LOCATION> Chuska </LOCATION> boarding schools for <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Defiance </LOCATION> district use a special curriculum requiring students to write something every day. Their eighth-graders do well, with <PERSON> Dilcon </PERSON>'s two months ahead of the national average.

<HEAD>Error Causes Change In Winner Of Statewide Math Contest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORMAL, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A numerical error led officials to crown the wrong team winner of a state high school math contest, but a rival suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> school reclaimed the honors after a recount, officials said. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathematics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Math </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contest </ORGANIZATION> considered the appeal of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s coach and found he was right Final score: New Trier 992, <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> Township High 979. A clerk tabulating the scores gave New Trier of <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> only three points in one event Saturday when it should have received 33 in the competition at <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` We regret it was announced that <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> was the first-place winner,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Shilgalis </PERSON>, a contest official. `` It's really nice to win, it's gratifying to win, but winning is n't why you do it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, coach of <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>'s math club. `` It's not football.'' Some <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> students were disappointed. `` We all started cheering and jumping up and down,'' senior <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Epp </PERSON> said Sunday. `` We were in first place for the first time, which was really fantastic.'' Still, <PERSON> Epp </PERSON>, the individual winner in the geometry event, said, `` I think that having fun and learning good math is a lot more important than whether we win state.'' Saturday's win brought New Trier its eighth consecutive crown in the contest and also pitted two schools whose rivalry is fierce _ in the classroom and the playing field. <PERSON> Rhoad </PERSON> called this year's event the `` battle of the giants'' because <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> and New Trier placed high in a national written math contest in March. Of the 14,000 schools entered, <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> placed first, a Canadian school placed second and <PERSON> New </PERSON> <PERSON> Trier </PERSON> was third. At the weekend contest here, students competed in 13 events, including a relay in which each member of a four-student team worked on one-fourth of the problem.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gazed from a balcony over the sunny, riverfront lawn party where a well-dressed crowd sipped wine. `` No one ever told us it was going to be easy,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> shouted to the 300 partygoers. But the candidate wanted his predominately black audience to remember something: `` When you consider what we came from, we do n't have the ability to get tired `` This is not just <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. This is from the back of the bus in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> to being within one of three to being the next president.'' It is a theme that has become increasingly prominent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in recent days after his heavy losses in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primaries. He is sounding a twofold message as he trails <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> down the home stretch of the primary season: First, he vows to fight on to win the nomination and raise issues. But second, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> highlights the historic aspect of his candidacy, casting it in terms that spell victory whether he wins or loses the nomination. In the face of a new poll showing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a 40-point lead in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, whose primary is Tuesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appeared to be dwelling increasingly on this over the weekend. By pointing to his unquestioned successes and the wide acceptance his candidacy has received, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> paints his effort as an outgrowth of the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and another step on the road to full equality for blacks. He contrasts his bid for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with the grim days more than two decades ago when people died fighting for just the right to vote. So as he campaigns across <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, he tells church crowds and rallies that his candidacy is far more than a journey from the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses in February to this summer's Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. It's a journey that began when blacks began rebelling in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, against being forced to ride in the back of the bus, he said. And it's a mission that must be carried forward by people like the well-heeled crowd at the estate of physician <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> in this <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> suburb, he told them. He said reporters are asking him after his string of losses, `` How can you go on?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s answer: `` Do you know how far we've come? ... We're almost to the top of the hill We've come too far. We must press forward.'' The crowd laughed with acknowledgement when he pointed to the strides they have made financially, saying, `` Most of us standing here today are one generation out of chitlins.'' To dramatize his point, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> related as he often does the story of his humble <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> beginnings _ born to a teenage mother and the married man next door, living in a house with wallpaper for warmth not decoration, waiting to eat Thanksgiving dinner until his mother came home with leftovers from the table of the white people whose meal she had prepared. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sometimes seems amazed himself as he tells the story. `` When I win, there are no more impossible dreams,'' he often says. But in keeping with his portrayal of his candidacy as part of a historical continuum, he told his <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> audience that he expects them to carry on the movement. He said they must `` translate this movement'' into demands for blacks in positions of authority at banks and universities and corporations where there are still barriers, as well as in government. `` When I shake apples from the tree, you must pick up these apples and make them into jelly and take them to the market,'' he said. `` To have continuity in our struggle we must establish a heritage of success in the government for all coming generations.''

<HEAD>Soviet Grain Goal Questioned</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s grain production target for 1988 is unrealistic, despite <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s well-publicized `` intensive technology program'' to boost agricultural output, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst. Christian J. Foster of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said this year's Soviet target is 235 million metric tons, including wheat, corn and other grains. `` This total is unrealistic, even though it is only 2 million tons above the 1987 goal,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. `` Soviet plans continue to call for unlikely grain output goals of 250 million to 255 million tons by 1990 and 260 million to 280 million by 1995.'' A major part of Soviet strategy is the intensive technology program, which means greater use of better-quality fertilizers, pesticides, seed and farm equipment. It also means use of these production items should be concentrated on the best soils. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said that in 1986 almost 73 percent of the area planted to wheat and other `` small'' grains was fertilized, a record. The application rate per hectare -LRB- 2.47 acres -RRB- was up 20 percent from 1985 and nearly 70 percent from 1980. `` Moreover, the fertilizers, which have often benefited mainly weeds, have been increasingly supplemented by herbicides and other plant protection agents -LRB- PPAs -RRB-,'' he said in the May issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. `` To compensate for lower quality domestically produced PPAs, emphasis has been placed on imports of more potent chemicals from the West.'' By 1990, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> plans to use intensive technology on as much as 50 million hectares, `` despite the fact that constraints to broadening the program are already appearing in its slowing rate of expansion,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. The area for intensive technology rose about 10 million hectares in 1986 from less than 19 million hectares in 1985, he said. But the increase slowed to about 6 million hectares in 1987 and is planned to increase only 4 million in 1988. `` Furthermore, the additional grain production from intensive technology in 1987 was a reported 25 million tons, only 1 million more than in 1986,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. `` This is in spite of a reported 20 percent increase from 1986 in the area under the program.'' Last year's Soviet grain output was 211.3 million tons, up only 1 percent from 1986, but <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> noted that it was the first time ever that two consecutive grain crops of more than 200 million tons had been harvested. Bad weather hurt the quality of 1987 grain, although the average yield of 1.83 tons per hectare was second only to the record 1.85 tons harvested in 1978. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said the 1988 winter grain crop, which includes winter wheat, rye and barley, was planted under favorable conditions last fall and is thought to have suffered below-average winterkill. `` A concern of Soviet farmers in the New Lands this spring is the lack of high-quality seed for spring grain,'' he said. `` The quality of seed stocks was below average in the areas with harvesting problems last year _ the Urals region, the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> region, northern <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and the Non-Black Soil Zone.'' A chronic problem for Soviet planners _ partly related to climate and geography _ is the production of milling wheat, the high-quality grain desired for bread, pasta and other food products. `` Their problems persist despite plans calling for self-sufficiency in food grains, and despite wheat production twice the size of food needs,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. As a result, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has looked to foreign sources for high-quality wheat to augment its own vast harvests of lower quality grain. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, particularly since subsidized prices have been available under <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Export Enhancement Program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, has been the main beneficiary. In the international marketing year that will end June 30, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will import around 22 million tons of wheat, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> providing about half, up from less than 1 percent just two years ago. `` The expected increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of Soviet wheat imports in 1987-88 likely will be at the expense of other primary suppliers _ <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbig </PERSON> said he planned to resign as conductor of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> because of numerous violations of his contract, a newspaper reported today. <PERSON> Herbig </PERSON>, the orchestra's conductor since 1984, told musicians about his plans during intermission of Saturday night's concert. On Sunday, he declined to discuss his resignation, effective when his contract expires in 1990, The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. Several musicians told newspaper that <PERSON> Herbig </PERSON> cited several complaints, many of them related to the orchestra's financial troubles. Among <PERSON> Herbig </PERSON>'s complaints, they said, were cancellation of a 1989-90 tour of the Far East; refusal to guarantee frequent domestic tours; reduction of the number of guaranteed musicians from 103 to 97; and refusal to promise the orchestra will move in 1989-90 from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION> to Orchestra Hall. `` <PERSON> Herbig </PERSON> told us that virtually the only thing they honored in the contract was payment, and that even that was sometimes late,'' said <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Janowsky </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DSO </ORGANIZATION> bassist. Orchestra board Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in a statement Sunday that the orchestra's financial troubles caused the board to fail to meet some terms of <PERSON> Herbig </PERSON>'s contract. But it was the board's `` intention and hope to honor Maestro <PERSON> Herbig </PERSON>'s contract in every detail,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Herbig </PERSON> said he would complete a second three-year term under a contract he signed in 1987, leaving 28 months to work with management in finding a replacement. The orchestra in November, while musicians were in the midst of a 12-week work stoppage, announced a deficit of $ 1.4 million for the 1986-87 season, raising its cumulative deficit to $ 4.1 million against an annual budget of $ 14 million. A deficit reduction campaign has been launched. But The News, citing an unidentified source close to the orchestra, said musicians were told last week an additional deficit of $ 400,000 was anticipated for this season.

 The 75-year-old president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> denied allegations he traded patronage jobs for sexual favors, saying he was guilty of nothing more than poor judgment and having sex that `` hurt no one.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>, who is also chairman of the powerful county <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, read a short statement at a news conference Sunday, then got into a shouting match with a reporter, went to his office and locked the door. In his statement, <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> called the allegations `` repulsive'' and said they were an attempt to smear a reputation built in 35 years in public office. He said the allegations raised by the <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a private watchdog group, and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> WMAQ </ORGANIZATION>, `` wrongfully portray me as some sort of perverted old man.'' The association contends that <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> engaged in three-way sex and strip poker with various pairs of four lesbian women at his farm near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> between 1980, the year his wife died, and 1986. While <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> acknowledges having sex with two women he later hired, he said his actions `` were not sordid, filthy or illegal.'' In his latest denial of the accusations, <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> said he was guilty of nothing except `` extremely poor judgment'' and `` having relationships with the opposite sex, which hurt no one.'' <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>, president of the county's governing board for 19 years, rejected the association's call that he resign. `` There is nothing that I have done over those years that has violated the public trust in me,'' he said. He refused to say whether it was appropriate to hire women after having sex with them, and told a <ORGANIZATION> WMAQ </ORGANIZATION> reporter who repeatedly asked that question, `` You're the scum of the earth and so is the <ORGANIZATION> BGA </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> BGA </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> has admitted that `` as far as we know,'' <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> did not make sex a condition for hiring the women. `` Within two weeks in two instances, the people are on the public payroll,'' <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> said Sunday. `` To me, that's an obvious link. There's no doubt about it.'' Three of the women <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> allegedly had sex with are on the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> payroll and one used to be, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> BGA </ORGANIZATION> says one of the women who had sex with <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> has been an officer with the county Forest Preserve police since 1984, and another was hired by the preserve as a laborer in 1980. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a former political aide to Mayors <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, said he doubts <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> broke any laws. `` It's clear that he simply used his immense hiring powers ... in effect to pass out favors to friends,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. `` That's not illegal ... but it is exemplary of really terrible abuse of the patronage system. `` This is the kind of scandal that has brought down governments,'' he said. `` However, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> being what it is, you find more people on the street commenting on his virility at age 75 than whether or not this was a heinous act.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, survivor of invasions, repression and political warfare, commemorates on Wednesday its 90th anniversary as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foremost center of learning. The celebrations have been pegged not to the college's founding date in 1898 but to a famous uprising on May 4, 1919, that vaulted <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students into the vanguard of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s revolutionary and nationalist movements The university marks its birthday with symposiums on its great thinkers, publication of books chronicling the university's role in shaping modern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, sports competition and disco and folk dancing. But as it enters its 10th decade, <LOCATION> Beida </LOCATION>, as it is known in its abbreviated Chinese form, faces yet another crisis, a lack of money that educators claim could seriously erode its standards of excellence. `` We have many problems,'' said <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Huaicheng </PERSON>, director of the president's office. `` Facilities are quite backward and need to be renovated. Students live six to a room. There are not enough classrooms and the library is inadequate. We ca n't even buy all the books we need.'' <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> said the school last year had to cut corners to make up a $ 1.3 million gap between planned spending and funds of $ 8.1 million from the government and other sources. He said there's no money left to boost pay for instructors, who start out at less than $ 30 a month, about the same as an unskilled laborer, and seldom make more than $ 55. Most of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1,000 universities share the same financial plight. The government, acknowledging that education has been neglected in the past, is spending more, but must give priority to lower education in a nation still 20 percent illiterate. The government now is encouraging teachers to help out colleges and bolster their meager incomes by moonlighting. Universities are being told to make money by selling basic services and technology. <PERSON> Beida </PERSON> students and faculty, living up to their activist traditions, have been the first to question the wisdom of this policy. Students with shoeshine kits appeared on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s central Tiananmen Square to show what they thought of sideline jobs. Open letters to members of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s parliament and big-character posters on the campus recently spoke of the `` crisis'' engendered by the government's investing in industrial development rather than its human resources. `` Beida students have a tradition of being concerned about the future of the country,'' <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> said. University President <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Shisin </PERSON> defended the protestors and complained to <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> journalists that some department heads at the university did n't even have their own offices. <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> began in 1898 as the <ORGANIZATION> Peking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. It was founded during the Qing Dynasty's `` 100-Day Reform,'' a short-lived effort to introduce some Western ideas in government and education. For its first two decades, the school's main role was to turn out government functionaries, and among its less kind nicknames were `` the gambling den'' and `` fountainhead of ribaldry and bawdiness.'' That changed in 1916 when <PERSON> Cai </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuanpei </PERSON>, a classical scholar who had studied in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, became president. <PERSON> Cai </PERSON> introduced Western scholarship and coed education and brought in educators such as <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Duxiu </PERSON>, one of the fathers of Chinese leftism, and <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>, who studied under American pragmatist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> and led the movement to use the vernacular language in Chinese literature. One of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first Marxists, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Dazhao </PERSON>, was librarian and then professor at <LOCATION> Beida </LOCATION>. Among his library assistants was <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beida </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> universities moved to the southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION> after Japanese troops invaded the capital in 1937, returning only in 1946 after World War II ended. Three years later <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> came to power in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, bringing with him strong anti-intellectual biases. In 1957, when <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> encouraged critics to speak out with the slogan, `` Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend,'' <PERSON> Beida </PERSON> teachers declared that `` the masses want to overthrow the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' They were among the first to be purged in a subsequent crackdown. <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Yinzhu </PERSON>, an American-educated economist, was replaced as president in 1960 and disappeared shortly after knocking government policies in a magazine article where he said, `` It is not enough to destroy; one must build.'' The first clashes of the disastrous Cultural Revolution began at <LOCATION> Beida </LOCATION> in 1966 when <PERSON> Nie </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuanzi </PERSON>, a woman in the philosophy department backed by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON>, leveled attacks on university President <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ping </PERSON>. In the next few years hundreds on the campus were detained, driven to suicide or murdered in armed battles between rival radical factions. For a decade almost all classes were suspended and no degrees were given. `` The Cultural Revolution brought overall destruction to the university,'' <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> said. He said entrance exams were revived in 1977. The school now accepts about one out of five examinees. It has offered degrees since 1981. The school now has 20,000 students, including post-graduates and special students, with a freshman class of about 2,000. Since its merger in 1952 with <ORGANIZATION> Yanjing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a former American missionary college, it has occupied 500 acres of wooded land in northwest <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Qing Dynasty-style buildings with red pillars and slanted, tiled roofs and surrounded by bamboo groves and lakes are one throwback to the Yanjing period. One fixture that will be missing at 90th anniversary celebrations will be a giant statue of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, torn down late one night in April by university workmen. Teachers who helped build the monolith during the early days of the Cultural Revolution applauded its removal, saying it was one reminder of the past they could live without.

<HEAD>Voters Overseas to Get Blank Ballots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ballots without the names of specific candidates will be available for the first time to an estimated 3 million Americans in other countries who are eligible to vote on Nov. 8 for the next president. The new, fill-in-the-blank ballots are for people who may not be able to get a regular absentee ballot submitted in time _ from a remote mission in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, for example, or a submarine at sea for months. But mostly they are for the victims of slow mail deliveries. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said a million of these write-in ballots will be sent in July to all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies and consulates and to the voting officers attached to each military unit overseas. The object is to increase the number of Americans who vote, even if they are working, traveling or living abroad. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> have the largest number of such civilians. The biggest numbers of military are in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> estimates that in the 1984 election, about 55 percent of the overseas military and 35 percent of civilians cast ballots. For civilians, that was much lower than the national average of 53.1 percent. He also estimates on the basis of polls that 8.5 percent _ roughly 250,000 _ tried to vote but failed to get in a regular absentee ballot and have it counted by voting authorities at home. There were many causes, including failure to write the proper office in time, failure of local authorities to mail the ballot in time, failure of the voter to mail it back, or failure of local deliveries abroad. Absentee ballots that arrive too late are not counted. `` We just got a court order Monday to make election officials in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> count absentee ballots received up to 10 days after the April 26 primary,'' <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Most <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> election officials began mailing their absentee ballots only two weeks before the election.'' One reason for slow mailing by local authorities is that they have to wait until candidates are named before they can start printing. The blank absentee ballots will be usable only for federal positions in the general election on Nov. 8. The voter must first write for a regular absentee ballot from his or her district at home, getting the application in at least 30 days before Election Day. If the absentee ballot does not reach the voter in time, he or she can write in the name of a choice for president, for senator if there is a senatorial election in the state and for a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. The names of political parties can be written instead, and such tickets may be split. `` You can write the name of one party as your choice for president and another party for the senator, if you do n't write individual names,'' <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> explained. State authorities will have to count the write-in ballot as they do regular absentee ballots. The write-ins are not to be used or distributed within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>. But they will be sent to units deploying to overseas assignments and to ships and submarines expected to be at sea on Election Day.

 Special interest groups have supplied $ 53 million to congressional candidates in the last 15 months, with the chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> making the biggest haul. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who faces a challenge this fall from Republican Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, led the list of recipients of political action committee money with $ 1.4 million. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also ranked as the largest overall fund-raiser among candidates so far, with just over $ 5 million by March 31, compared with <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>'s $ 365,000. The figures were released Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which said congressional candidates raised $ 180 million overall in the first 15 months of the two-year cycle that culminates with November's elections. Of that, it said, $ 53 million _ or 29 percent _ came from the special-interest groups known as PACs. At the comparable time in 1986, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> contenders had raised $ 167 million, of which $ 41 million was in PAC money, a 24 percent share. The growing clout of special interests in congressional elections has prompted <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> critics to seek voluntary restraints on the amount of such money that can be spent by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates. The Democratic push has been stymied by Republican filibusters. Overall, the 143 candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats raised $ 79 million during the 15-month period, about $ 1 million less than at the comparable time two years ago. The decrease was due in part to a smaller number of candidates than in 1986. The 1,201 candidates for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats had pulled in $ 101 million as of March 31, a $ 14 million increase. The jump came in part because 17 more incumbents are seeking re-election than two years ago. Aside from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races in two other populous states _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> _ also ranked high on the money lists. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., ranked second behind <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in overall fund raising, with more than $ 4 million collected toward his contest with challenger <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, the Democratic <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lieutenant governor <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s receipts totaled $ 2.4 million. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, incumbent Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> ranked third in fund raising at $ 3.7 million, while his opponent, Republican Cleveland Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>, had raised $ 2.5 million. Among House races, the leader was Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who is trying to hold onto the traditionally Democratic seat he has held for two terms. He raised $ 800,000 during the first 15 months of the election season. Close behind were Reps. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif., with $ 750,000, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., with $ Top recipients of PAC money among <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members were <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., with $ 267,000, and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, with $ 257,000 Also ranking high on that list was <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., with nearly $ 257,000 in special-interest money

<HEAD>Quiet Negotiations Under Way on Clean Air, Acid Rain Bills</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation to control urban air pollution and acid rain has been stalled in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but there are stirrings in the House trenches and talk of an offensive in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Factions in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are finally exchanging proposals in quiet negotiations that started only after nine renegade Democrats led by Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, D-Wash., politely grabbed the reins from warring chairmen In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, is openly threatening a parliamentary end-run around Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, an acid-rain control foe who has refused floor time to the <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> clean air bill that has been ready for debate since last And on both sides of the Capitol, a new phrase has entered the vocabulary of lawmakers and environmental lobbyists trying to break the clean air logjam: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Their message is clear: the Clean Air Act will be strengthened, possibly with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> occupied by a man perceived to have a stronger environmental commitment than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s name is creeping into this scenario. He is a candidate to succeed <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> next year when the West Virginian steps down from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s most powerful post. `` Hopefully, those who've tried to stop any legislation will look at a new majority leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the possibility of a Democratic administration in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and see that this is the year to work out acid rain,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., the environmentalists' point man in the House Time is running short. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which will take time off for the national political conventions and its own re-election campaigns, has set an Aug. 31 deadline for action. That is the stopgap date set last December as the Clean Air Act's deadline for metropolitan areas to meet standards for maximum levels of ozone and carbon monoxide or risk sanctions like a ban on construction of new pollution sources. More than 60 areas are not expected to attain the standards. The debate in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is over how much more time they should be given to reduce air pollution and what steps they must take to comply with the health-based standards. The biggest apparent stumbling block on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> side is whether to force automakers to produce vehicles with cleaner emissions and install equipment to capture polluting gasoline fumes during refueling. These are not pleasant questions for the powerful Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., who comes from an automaking district The acid rain component of the clean air struggle is far more complicated for lawmakers trying to combat coal-burning plant emissions that produce the fallout some scientists say poses human health risks and harms lakes, coastal waters and building facades. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> illustrates part of the complications. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> not only has power plants that would need improvements under the <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> bill but also a high-sulfur coal industry in the northern part of the state. It could be hurt if power plants switch to cleaner fuel like natural gas to meet the bill's requirements. Most of the utilities that would be affected by an acid rain bill are in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Lawmakers from that area do n't want to see their constituents' electricity bills run up by expensive smokestack scrubbers to clean up emissions. Western lawmakers like the idea of being able to sell their low-sulfur coal to the Midwest. But many do n't like <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s idea of a surtax on electric bills nationwide to soften the blow on Midwestern ratepayers. The power companies, like the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, do n't want any acid rain legislation at all. These foes argue that scientists are divided over the effects of acid deposition and that the nation should await the arrival of clean-coal technology being sought under a $ 2.5 billion research program. Southerners are not bystanders. Acid rain problems have shown up from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Northeasterners, downwind from <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> utilities, want action, as does the environmental lobby. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> says he has been negotiating with colleagues, including <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, to get his bill to the floor. He said in an interview last week that supporters will take direct action if the leadership does n't call the bill up for debate. `` Clearly, there will be an effort to tack it on to something else as an amendment,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, one of 48 senators who have written <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> asking for floor time. <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a Byrd spokeswoman, says the majority leader `` has no plans to call up an acid rain bill.'' She quoted <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> as saying: `` Any senator may at any time call up an amendment to any bill. I would not be surprised if this is tried with acid rain.'' Meanwhile, the clock is ticking toward Aug. 31 with some supporters of tougher air pollution control laws vowing to oppose another deadline extension. `` This really is a race with the clock,'' says <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, adding that his so-called Group of Nine hopes to have its own acid rain plan drafted in two weeks in an effort to get movement on this issue in Energy and Commerce. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, co-sponsor of a tough acid rain bill with Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, D-Minn., says he soon may call his health subcommittee back to the table to try to win approval of a clean air package and throw the issue to <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s full committee <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> suspended bill-writing efforts nearly two months ago, his panel still evenly split over the acid rain control question.

 A sightseeing helicopter carrying five people crashed into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and sank Sunday, killing a passenger who was trapped underwater for more than an hour and a half, authorities said. The other four, including the 22-year-old pilot, were pulled out of the murky water by police Harbor Unit officers who found two men clinging to pontoons and two grasping for other bits of wreckage. They were not seriously injured. The accident occurred almost three years to the day after a helicopter operated by a subsidiary of the same company, <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, plunged into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> with eight people aboard. One man, a Japanese businessman, died. In Sunday morning's accident, the helicopter had just completed a 15-to-20-minute tour of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> when it plunged into the river about 15 blocks north of its destination, the 34th Street heliport, police said. The aircraft, a Bell 206-B, was hovering about 1,000 feet above the river awaiting permission to land when the pilot `` experienced performance difficulties,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempster </PERSON>, chairman of Island Helicopters. The pilot activated emergency flotation pontoons and `` initiated emergency landing procedures,'' <PERSON> Dempster </PERSON> said. On impact, however, the flotation devices apparently separated from the rest of the craft. Rescue efforts culminated in scuba divers finding a passenger strapped to a rear seat of the helicopter on the bottom of the river, 35 feet below the surface. The water temperature was in the mid-40s, and the man had been under water more than 100 minutes, divers said. The passenger, identified as <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Oyama </PERSON> by the Japanese Consulate, was taken to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where he died at 9:05 p.m., said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schectman </PERSON>, a hospital adminstrator.

<TEXT>
 Four months after he completed a 25-year prison term, <PERSON> Modesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> has yet to taste freedom. The former army captain was convicted of killing a cadet in 1962 who allegedly learned of his involvement in a plot to overthrow President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s longest-reigning leader <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON>, 56, said in an interview in March that he was never allowed to appear in court to plead his innocence and that his confession was extracted by torture, including electric shocks on a grill. `` When you are defenseless under the torturers, 10 in my case, you give in and say what they want you to,'' <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> was released from prison on Dec. 20 but was put under police custody in the town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estanislao </LOCATION>, 85 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>. He was brought to <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> in February, where two round-the-clock guards prevented him from leaving the home of his invalid mother. The government said without elaboration that the guards were protecting Ortigoza. He escaped March 25 with the help of an opposition leader. Both fled one block to the residence of Colombian Ambassador <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Emiliani </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> granted both political asylum but the <LOCATION> Paraguayan </LOCATION> government has refused to act on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s request for safe-conduct passage out of the country for <LOCATION> Ortigoza </LOCATION> and the dissident, <PERSON> Hermes </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Emiliani </PERSON> recently said he has had `` no news'' on the pending requests for safe passage. Interior Minister <PERSON> Sabino </PERSON> <PERSON> Montanaro </PERSON> says his country is in no rush to grant <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> safe passage, calling him a `` common criminal.'' Government officials have branded <PERSON> Saguier </PERSON>, 40, a subversive and compared <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON>'s escape to the embassy `` a terrorist action.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Saldivar </PERSON> declined to say when the government would respond to <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON>'s request for safe passage. `` It looks like it will be one of those things that will go on and on and on indefinitely,'' said a European diplomatic who has followed the situation closely. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity. Neither Ortigoza nor <PERSON> Saguier </PERSON> are allowed to speak to reporters or to leave the ambassador's residence. Their lawyers, family and close friends are the only ones permitted to visit. <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON>'s treatment is meant to be a lesson to those who would conspire against <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, in power since 1954. <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Digno </PERSON> <PERSON> Britez </PERSON>, says the May 16-18 visit to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s trip to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in June could help <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saguier </PERSON> gain safe passage out of <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> would not want something like that to be brought up while he visits the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Britez </PERSON> said, adding: `` Our government is not a democracy so the consequences were pretty predictable from the start.''

<HEAD>Oil Talks: Fasting, Jet Lag And `Near Non-OPEC Members'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some wondered what it would be like if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders met during <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON>, the traditional Moslem month of fasting that began April 18. Now we have the answer: grueling. Because some of the 13 delegations are mainly or exclusively Christian, part of the cartel's oil negotiations took place during the day. That's the normal time for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> business. But because the Moslem members prefer to slow down during their sunrise-to-sunset fast, the formal <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> sessions started late at night, after the Moslems had eaten their `` breakfast.'' As a result, some of the oil debate was in progress almost around the clock. The non-Moslem oil ministers found it hard to cope with the schedule, which forced them to try to sleep part of the day. One said he was taking pills to stay awake during the nighttime sessions. Some said they felt as though they had been hit with jet lag, minus the travel.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Often it's hard to understand why <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders have so much trouble settling their differences over oil policy. Once in a while it's easy. Consider a comment by <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil minister, to reporters who asked whether he was ready to give up his minority opposition to an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> plan: `` I usually am very reasonable and willing to discuss anything, once our point of view has been accepted.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Another clue to why <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s meetings often last longer than would seem necessary: `` We know that some -LRB- delegates -RRB- like to be out of our respective countries,'' said an official from an African <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member. `` A weekend in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ not bad.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 It's getting harder to classify the players in the international oil game. Time was, and not long ago, you had two types: those in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and those outside it. At the latest <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> conference the distinctions were a little less clear. You had the usual 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. But you also had something called `` non-OPEC,'' an unofficial association of six independent oil-producing nations, including <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, that wants to establish formal ties to the cartel without becoming members. Then you had three other oil producers _ <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> and the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ who wanted to rub elbows with the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders but still keep enough distance to stand outside the `` non-OPEC'' camp. Some called these three `` near non-OPEC.'' And then there are the rest, producers such as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that want to have nothing to do with the cartel.

 <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that regulates the state's oil industry, met several staffers at <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters last week, including the deputy secretary general, <PERSON> Fadhil </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalabi </PERSON>. He said he found them knowledgeable about oil but also very cautious. `` I guess I would be, too, if I had 13 bosses,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, a Nigerian, is the top <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> boss, at least in title. He is president of the formal conferences and the highest ranking spokesman for the cartel. At the end of the latest meeting <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> lashed out at the news media, accusing it of trying to stampede <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> into making decisions. `` Why should we make a decision just because you say we should?'' he said in a high-pitched tone to one reporter.

 As the strike at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> steelworks entered its sixth day, 120 haggard workers appeared at the facility's gate to receive flowers, food and words of support from tearful family members. Most of the 50 wives, children and parents of the striking workers remained outside the partially opened gate on Sunday, but a some weeping wives stepped a few feet inside to embrace their husbands. `` I know that my voice is breaking,'' strike leader <PERSON> Andrezej </PERSON> <PERSON> Szewczuwaniec </PERSON> told the group. `` But I'm very moved. There is lot of optimism in me because there is only one Polish heart, and it can not be split.'' He told the families that the strike, which began Tuesday for higher pay and union recognition, would continue today. `` We will not disappoint our wives, our sons, our mothers nor you behind the gate,'' he said. When he stopped speaking, the crowd began chanting, `` God bless you! God bless you!'' The family members passed plastic bags of food and bunches of flowers through the gate to the strikers, and the group sang patriotic hymns from both sides of the fence. Earlier in the day, police had stopped some people from marching to the plant. But police were nowhere around the main plant gates at midafternoon, when the family members began arriving on foot or by public transportation. The families offered words of support: `` We are with you. ... We support you. ... Long live the mill.'' `` We are all moved here,'' said another member of the strike committee, <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Handzlik </PERSON>. `` Here we are seven years after martial law and again we raise our hands, we raise our heads, we raise our backs. `` We want to demand human and social rights that we deserve. We want to assure you that we will go on with the strike.'' After the speeches, the workers said `` Do widzenia'' _ `` Until we see you again'' _ and marched back inside the plant.

<TEXT>
 The federal trial of a woman accused of killing her husband and another woman with cyanide-laced Excedrin, the nation's first murder-by-product-tampering case, is nearing its end. The jury in the trial of <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 44, was to hear closing arguments today, then be charged by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> before beginning its deliberations. If convicted, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> could be sentenced to life in prison. She is accused of five instances of tampering with over-the-counter medicine, including the two cases involving death. She has denied any involvement in the deaths. According to prosecutors, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, unhappy in her marriage and frustrated by more than $ 8,500 in debts, plotted the June 1986 death of <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 52, to collect $ 176,000 in life insurance benefits. They also said she placed other tainted pain-relievers on the shelves of area drugstores to make the poisoning appear random. Sue <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, died two weeks after <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>. She swallowed poisoned Excedrin capsules, authorities said. The <PERSON> Nickells </PERSON> apparently did n't know Ms. Snow. In sometimes tearful testimony Wednesday and Thursday, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> denied killing her husband of 12 years or knowing he had more than $ 25,000 in life insurance. She said she did library research in 1983 and 1984 on poisonous plants, including some containing cyanide, to protect children from dangerous foliage on their rural property. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> denied testimony by her 28-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, who said her mother had contemplated killing <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> for some time. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> also denied testimony from another relative who she had talked about reaping `` close to 200 grand'' in life insurance benefits. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> admitted that in the spring of 1986, she and her sporadically-employed husband owed more than $ 8,500. But she insisted there was nothing macabre about the letters she wrote to one bank shortly before <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s death indicating that her `` marriage problems'' were almost over and that payments would stay current. A prosecution rebuttal witness, <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, concluded testimony in the trial Thursday. She said that Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, her former roommate, had told her that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> talked of getting rid of her husband and asked how much cocaine it would take to kill a person.

 The apparent suicide of Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s top aide sent shock waves through <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s political community, but fellow Democrats predicted the congressman would be re-elected to a fifth term. `` I do n't think this reflects on <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>.

If that is the case, I would see no reason that he would n't be re-elected as he was in the past,'' said <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, who has known <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> about 15 years. Eastern Shore Republicans, who are seeking to regain control of the seat, also were shocked. `` I find it very difficult to be critical of Mr. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> at this point,'' said <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent in the November election, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilchrest </PERSON>. `` Being critical at this point is not necessary.''

<HEAD>Cable Industry Growing Into `Goliath'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After years of being considered the little sibling of broadcast television, some say the cable TV industry is beginning to look more like Goliath than <PERSON> David </PERSON>. Cable TV, now watched by more than 50 percent of all American households, has become a $ 12 billion industry that is gaining viewers steadily, mostly at the expense of the broadcast networks. But with prosperity comes increased scrutiny, and in cable's case <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been raising questions about concentration of ownership within the industry, complaints of poor service and rising rates Some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say it may be time to reregulate cable TV. `` We have to pay attention to this,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told an audience at the opening session of the group's annual convention Sunday. `` We ca n't rebuff our friends,'' he said. `` An important part of good business is good politics.'' More than 13,000 people are expected to attend the convention, which runs through Tuesday. Most governmental regulation has been lifted from the industry. The most recent deregulation came in January 1987 when most cable systems were freed of municipal rate control. They now have more control than ever on what viewers see and how much they pay. Deregulation brought increases in rates. The industry says the average subscriber's bill rose 6.7 percent in the first six months after price control was lifted, but critics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cite instances of rates going up by as much as 400 percent in some systems. Despite the increase, subscribers continued to sign on. Cable systems added more than 4 million subscribers in 1987, putting the percentage of households receiving cable to nearly 52 percent _ about 45 million households. Now that many cable companies have finished building their systems _ wiring more than 80 percent of the nation's households _ cable companies are starting to pay off their debt and are putting their cash into programming. `` Programming is going to drive penetration,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cownie </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> NCTA </ORGANIZATION> chairman. `` That's going to move us up to the 70 percent saturation level from 52 percent where we are now.'' The industry has been encouraged by the success of its early efforts, like <PERSON> Showtime </PERSON>'s `` It's <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shandling </PERSON>'s Show,'' a comedy series now on <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The show is one of only a few that have moved from cable to broadcast. Most of the migration is still from broadcast to cable, which has become home to many an old syndicated rerun. But cable executives say that will change as cable systems pour more money into developing their own programs. `` We should be more concerned with what the content will be than where it comes from,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>, chairman of Home Box Office. <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> received praise for its recent program `` Dear America: Letters Home from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' Cable TV, particularly the Entertainment and <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION>, also has been landing some big sports contracts. Exclusive cable contracts for big sports events, though, have been criticized for denying viewing of these games to those who do n't subscribe to cable Before cable came along, these games could be seen free on broadcast TV. But cable is likely to continue its foray into sports programming. `` There are more first run movies and sports on cable, and that's going to continue,'' said <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>. `` The only things that will get some protection -LRB- from cable-exclusive contracts -RRB- are big sports events like the Superbowl.''

<HEAD>Feelings Mixed Whether Rebuilt Downtown Is Better</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COALINGA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Coalinga </LOCATION>'s downtown business district, devastated five years ago by one of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s strongest earthquakes this century, is still struggling to recover. In one terrifying moment, the town's turn-of-the-century stores buckled under the force of the quake. The 6.7-magnitude temblor on May 2, 1983, dealt its heaviest toll to two blocks that held most of the community's retail stores. All had to be razed. Today on the same land, modern one-story block buildings house the merchants who hung on during the hard times after the quake in the town of 8,000 residents about 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. But vacant lots also mark much of downtown, raising concern that there are too few shops left to attract enough customers to be profitable. `` If there were other businesses, things would be working tremendously; there are too many empty lots,'' said <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, who moved all the clothes from her dress shop to her less-damaged home after the earthquake until she could get back in business, first in a gymnasium, then a house trailer and now in the rejuvenated downtown. Downtown businesses now include two dress shops, two banks, two drug stores, a furniture store, a combination bicycle-computer shop and a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> mail order store. Other downtown offices house a weekly newspaper, a lawyer, accountant and real estate agent. `` There are no coffee shops, so people do n't come downtown as much,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>. `` We need more retail in these two blocks, not offices.'' The city government, which aggressively secured a variety of financing to recover from the quake, owns the rebuilt stores and is trying to find more financing and more businesses to fill the empty lots. The city subsidizes rents, charging about 34 cents a square foot, said <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a councilman and <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> director. That's a sharp increase from the 10-20 cents per square foot merchants paid for space in the structures wiped out by the quake. Those increases make survival difficult for store owners who were just making it under the old rents. Mrs. <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> said the owners of a jewelry store decided to retire after the earthquake, a television store closed and one business owner died of stress while struggling to keep going in a house trailer. Not all merchants have been hurt, however. The operators of Service Pharmacy owned their building and it was fully insured, enabling them to rebuild large enough for their needs and allow space to rent out offices. Sales taxes, which indicate how much retail business a community is doing, have n't climbed back to the level before the earthquake, which left 47 injured and caused an estimated $ 31 million in damage, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, the public works director. But 2,873 building permits were issued in the five years since for $ 41 million worth of new construction or rehabilitation, he said. `` That's about one permit per building in town,'' <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. There has been a net gain of 384 dwellings in <LOCATION> Coalinga </LOCATION> since the earthquake, allowing the population to increase from 7,000 to 8,000, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. The city also has a new natural gas system, new sewer lines, a new fire station, bus terminal, day care center, senior citizens center, fitness center and community swimming pool. Despite the personal and financial trauma, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> feels the earthquake `` was a real positive thing in making us clean up some problems we had in buildings _ safety and that type of thing.'' The quake was one of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 10 strongest quakes this century. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale.

<HEAD>House Swallowed By Acre-size Sinkhole</HEAD>

 When the house started groaning and the studs started popping, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Pivnick </PERSON> knew it was time to start running _ a sinkhole was about to swallow his home. `` I knew what it was as soon as it occurred and I knew how dangerous it could be,'' he said Sunday. `` I was afraid the walls were going to come tumbling down and ceiling was going to collapse.'' Besides scaring <PERSON> Pivnick </PERSON> and his neighbors, the sinkhole that opened up in a quiet middle-class development near here Friday surprised geologists with its size and location. `` I call this a double freak sinkhole because it's so far south and it's so big,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a geologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinkhole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday after examining the depression. The sinkhole, 20 feet deep and more than 200 feet wide, is one of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s largest, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` At least one whole acre has been swallowed up in one big gulp,'' he said. Neighbors rushed to <LOCATION> Sebring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> on Friday evening to pack up the possessions of people evacuated from the two houses consumed by the sinkhole. During the weekend, as the water table began to transform the sinkhole into a pond, neighbors started talked of moving, <PERSON> Pivnick </PERSON> said. `` In a couple of weeks everybody's going to forget about the big sinkhole in Sebring except the neighbors. They'll still be living on the edge,'' said <PERSON> Pivnick </PERSON>, a psychologist for the Avon Park Correctional Institution. Although police, fearing the house might plunge deeper, forbade <PERSON> Pivnick </PERSON> and a visiting friend from collecting any of their belongings, residents who were allowed to return have been generous and upbeat. `` I've had like eight people offer to give me a place to stay _ gratis,'' <PERSON> Pivnick </PERSON> said. `` I've talked to my adjusters and they seem to be very agreeable to helping me, but I had a friend visiting and none of her stuff was covered.'' <PERSON> Pivnick </PERSON>, 40, said his insurance will cover almost all the contents of his $ 70,000 three-bedroom single-story home. `` The loss is kind of settling in now,'' <PERSON> Pivnick </PERSON> said. `` I'm thinking about where I'm going to be living in three months. Around dinner time Friday, when `` the house was groaning, the studs were popping'' and the ground in the yard started to shift, <PERSON> Pivnick </PERSON> said they could only run out and warn neighbors. `` -LRB- Then -RRB- the people of Sebring came in _ I've never seen anything like it _ they arrived in pickups and packed up -LRB- neighbor <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>'s -RRB- house in about five minutes,'' <PERSON> Pivnick </PERSON> said. Police would not let them near his house. By Saturday, the sinkhole had stabilized with the evacuated <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> house on one side, off its cracked foundation and bowed in the center. A major cause of sinkholes is the altering of water tables flowing through limestone and clay formations under the soil. A sudden lowering of the water table caused by irrigation or drought, for instance, can weaken walls and roofs of the underground limestone caverns, leading to their collapse.

 There's a quote taped to her calendar that sums up the vigor of 96-year-old <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON>: `` I am not afraid of tomorrow, for I have seen yesterday and I love today.'' Today, she takes more naps than when she started working at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Her hearing is n't the greatest; and when she walks, it's a slow gait. But that has n't kept her from her jobs as bank president, village treasurer and insurance agent in this Southern Illinois town of 1,700. She keeps up the pace, `` because I like it. I love my work.'' `` I ca n't figure life without working,'' she added. Born in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> in 1892, Mrs. <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> moved to <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> when she was 3 months old. She graduated from the local high school in 1910 _ the year <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> was chartered _ and became a milliner. `` That's what I was gon na do,'' says the petite, white-haired, bespectacled woman. `` Then women stopped wearing hats.'' So in 1915 she joined the bank as a bookkeeper, and eventually held other jobs, including cashier and teller. She worked next to her husband, a cashier, from 1921 until he died in 1948. When he died, she took over as town treasurer, a post still holds. In 1967, she became bank president. But that's not all. She's also treasurer of the local women's club, and holds memberships on two village committees `` I do n't take any vacations,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON>, who has no children. `` I do n't have anyone here to take my place, and I think if you have a job you better take care of it.'' Since she suffered a mild heart attack last year, she does n't drive to work A bank employee picks her up and drives her to the home she shares with a retired teacher. `` She's 10 years younger than I am, but I have to take care of her,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON>. `` I do the cooking. I'm a gourmet cook.'' During the interview, Mrs. <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> was interrupted by some of the bank regulars _ one woman told her about a friend in the hospital and another talked about tulips. `` How you doing?'' said one friend. `` I'm up, but I'm not exactly at'em,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> responsed. A teen-ager asked for a piece of candy and Mrs. <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> obliged, but only after the girl repeated the request numerous times. `` I do n't hear very well,'' she explained. Though Mrs. <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> does n't like the word `` quit'' _ she calls it `` dirty'' _ she said she will retire in about a year. `` I do n't know what I'll do if I do n't work. You ca n't cook all the time,'' she said, noting that her spare time is spent napping, reading magazines and cooking. `` As you get older, you need more sleep,'' she said, laughing and adding: `` Yeah, I still can think.''

 Contra leaders outraged over actions of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said they want the next round of peace talks outside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, while President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has insisted that any new discussions take place in the country. Two of the five-member Nicaraguan Resistance, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, returned here Sunday following the second round of stalled talks. A key issue has been the workings of the cease-fire agreement signed in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, on March 23. `` They are hinging the entire cease-fire agreement on how goods will be delivered instead of on the democratization of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said. `` We had already agreed on how the goods will be delivered, and now they bring it up again.'' The leaders of the U.S.-backed rebels expressed outrage with the actions of the leftist government during the talks, saying Nicaraguan officials had reneged on promises and created an oppressive atmosphere that jeopardizes future talks in the wartorn country. `` They have been carrying on a succession of repressive actions against the people of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. `` They have taken action against striking workers, the interior minister has beaten one of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s distinguished radio reporters,'' he said, `` and we are forced to stay in our hotel like it's a prison.'' On Friday, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Osejo </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> anti-Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, claimed Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> summoned him to his office, berated the radio's reporting of anti-government demonstrations and punched him in the mouth. The next round of talks have been tentatively set for May 12-24. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> hopes they will be held outside of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, maybe in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> harshly criticized the rebels in his May Day speech Sunday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, and insisted that the talks continue in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` It's tough to endure having them here in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. We have to disinfect the entire city after these people leave,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told several thousand backers. `` But now that we're meeting in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the meetings have to continue in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' Rebel leaders say the latest round of talks stalled over details of how Contra forces may receive humanitarian supplies during a pact that calls for rebels to enter truce zones. The government is then to free 700 prisoners and allow Contras to join talks with Nicaraguan political parties. The Contras on Friday rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> proposal that the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> resupply the rebels. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is `` just another arm of the Sandinista government.'' He preferred that a private carrier agreeable to both sides bring in food, clothing and medicine. Sandinista police on Friday cordoned off the entrance to an anti-government workers union where demonstrations had been taking place. About 1,500 construction workers were protesting economic measures enacted a week earlier. Thirty-eight of those workers are on a hunger strike in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON> said Sunday that a group of Nicaraguan exiles in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> would lend support by starting a similar hunger strike.

 Iranian radicals will try to win control of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in a runoff election on May 13 that could determine the future course of the Islamic revolution. The staunchly anti-Western radicals made sizeable gains in the first round of voting on April 8 for 188 of the 270 seats in the Majlis, or parliament, but no faction won a majority. The runoff will be for the 82 remaining seats. The results of the first round, announced by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run media, show a tilt toward the radicals, with some leading conservatives losing their seats. The radicals could be helped in the runoff by the anti-American passions that resulted after six Iranian vessels were destroyed or disabled in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in battles with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on April 18. If the radicals win control of the legislature, they could use that anti-American sentiment to adopt an even tougher stand against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in the gulf over the next four-year parliamentary term. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported that just under 17 million Iranians voted in the first round, about 80 percent of the electorate. Interior Ministry <PERSON> Ali-Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, a hardliner whose power is growing, declared that the turnout for the third parliamentary election since <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s 1979 revolution was a record. Among the winners were <PERSON> Hojatoleslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Karroubi </PERSON>, firebrand head of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pilgrimage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> who is believed to have masterminded riots in the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> last July. <PERSON> Karroubi </PERSON>, a middle-ranking cleric, heads a radical group called Militant Clergymen. According to figures released by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, he polled 971,752 votes in his <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> constituency, second only to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, one of the most powerful figures in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, a close confidant of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, took more than 1.3 million votes, the highest single vote so far announced. `` The results so far indicate that the third Majlis will be heavily weighted in favor of the radicals, opening the way for reformist legislation,'' said London-based analyst <PERSON> Vahe </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrossian </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sick </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> specialst with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview: `` The real picture wo n't emerge until the runoffs ... and when the Majlis elects the cabinet.'' Nonetheless, the election is expected to produce big gains for the radicals who are advocating major economic and social reforms long blocked by conservative clerics and the `` Bazaaris,'' the wealthy merchant class who have survived the revolution and still wield considerable influence. Although the final makeup of the Majlis remains incomplete, the first-round voting appears to have bolstered both <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who favors economic reforms, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>. Among other radicals who won were <PERSON> Ateqe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sediqi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajai </PERSON>, widow of the late President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajai </PERSON>, and one of 35 women among the 1,700 candidates. <PERSON> Rajai </PERSON> was assassinated with Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahonar </PERSON>, when leftist opponents of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> bombed <PERSON> Bahonar </PERSON>'s office Aug. 31, 1981. Another winner was <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghafari </PERSON>, an Islamic ideologue who trained with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and was a key figure in forming <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Revolutionary Guards. He was among the winners in 14 of the 30 <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> districts where final results were announced, along with <PERSON> Fakhreddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hejazi </PERSON>, another firebrand mullah who got more than 700,000 votes, and former Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Salamati </PERSON>, with more than 500,000. One of the winners in the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Hojatoleslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadeq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalkali </PERSON>, a former Islamic judge who ordered the execution of hundreds of people by firing squad or the hangman's rope in the early days of the revolution. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said he polled nearly 200,000 votes in the first ballot. Several leading conservatives were either knocked out of the running or failed to win absolute majorities and now face runoff competition May 13, according to monitored radio reports. Among them were <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazdi </PERSON>, a prominent deputy in the Majlis; and former Commerce Minister <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> <PERSON> Asgarouladi </PERSON>. Former Interior Minister <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali-Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nateq-Nouri </PERSON>, a member of the now-disbanded hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, failed to get a clear majority and will have to run in the May 13 second round, <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Nateq-Nouri </PERSON>, who was also briefly armed forces commander after President <PERSON> Abolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> was ousted in 1982, now heads the Hojati group, an extremist Islamic faction. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>'s radicals held a slim majority in the last Majlis. But he got a big boost from <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> before the election that could improve that position. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, apparently seeking to break a legislative logjam he feared was paralyzing the government and delaying badly needed economic reforms, decreed sweeping powers for the government aimed at increasing state control of the economy as advocated by <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>.

 The first <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor born to captive parents is downing about 30 minced mice a day and slowly gaining weight, say keepers who are watching the bald, fluffy chick for infection. `` So far so good,'' <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday. `` We're not through the most critical period, which is 72 hours.'' The chick, named <PERSON> Molloko </PERSON>, an Indian word condor, was hatched with human help Friday, boosting the endangered species' numbers to 28. It ate 28 mice Saturday and 30 more by Sunday afternoon, Ms. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` The appetite of the bird is very good,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, adding that the chick had regained its birth rate of 6 -RCB- ounces. As adults, the birds have a wingspan up to 10 feet. The chick had very bright eyes and its bodily functions seemed to be operating correctly, she said. The fist-sized bird's attachment to its yolk sac, similar to a human infant's umbilical cord, was healing well. <PERSON> Molloko </PERSON> hatched from an egg laid by the only pair of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors known to be actively breeding.

Fourteen birds are female. The chick's sex has not been determined. The flock includes 13 condors hatched from eggs taken in the wild during the past five years. <PERSON> Molloko </PERSON> was the first addition since April 1986, when a chick hatched at the park from an egg laid in the wild.

<TEXT>
 After eight months on the job and several disputes with Jewish leaders, the American rabbi who leads <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s tiny Jewish community is heading home and may not return to communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> `` They attempted to silence me altogether,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said of the leadership of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Jewish community. <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, the communist country's first rabbi in 21 years, said: `` I do n't want to come across as whining, or as an enemy of the state or as being defeated.'' He added: `` I can at least say I have tried. I can not say I feel I have accomplished everything.'' <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said he plans to return to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on May 16. `` It's conceivable it -LRB- the return -RRB- is for good, but I may be back in September. I have no intention of being here beyond 1988, because the situation is too impossible to work.'' In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> compared his situation to a brief stint as a rabbi in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> in the early 1960s when he ran into strong resistance for speaking out in favor of civil rights for blacks. `` In a sense I feel the same kind of isolation,'' the feisty, 65-year-old reform rabbi said in his apartment in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The Polish-born survivor of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> and nine other <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> concentration camps took over the post that had been empty since 1966. He is the rabbi for the less than 350 officially registered Jews and about 100 people he says are `` on the fringes.'' The largest Jewish community, with a little under 200 members, is located in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Others are in the cities of <LOCATION> Halle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> took over the post in September 1987, after retiring as rabbi in <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Since then, he has run into several disputes with the head of the Jewish community in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, whom he asked the AP not to identify by name. `` Maybe he has orders from somewhere to keep me under control,'' <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> says. `` He even controls my mail.'' <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> says there have been efforts within the Jewish community to silence him, for example by making it difficult to teach adult religious classes. `` I was told not to speak on Friday night because the service was too long. But that's a lie,'' says <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>. `` It was designed to silence me.'' He also has taken to task the editor of a government-run East German newspaper for alleged inaccuracies in reporting about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He also is worried about anti-Semitism in the news media, and points to the work of an East German cartoonist he says uses such themes. <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> also criticized the government's unwillingness to help restore the dilapidated Jewish community building where he works. `` Yes, I have violated taboos,'' he says, but insists everything he has done is permitted, even in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> is paid by the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Jewish community, which in turn receives funds from the communist government. The rabbi emphasized during the AP interview he had always viewed his post as a `` temporary assignment.'' <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said that he would return to his home in <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION>. Asked if he planned to write an autobiography, the rabbi replied with a smile: `` I soon may have enough time.'' While <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> outlines his disagreements in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, there has been some criticism of him as well. `` The Jewish community in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is startled by the unconventionality and the independence of their rabbi,'' the authoritative Frankfurter <ORGANIZATION> Allgemeine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said of him in a profile on April 19. The West German newspaper also said the `` tempermental rabbi'' had threatened to leave in the past.

 The last time <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Meserole </PERSON> stood under the spotlights before an applauding crowd she was taking off the cloth instead of putting it on. `` At one time, she was known as <PERSON> Shari </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> and she was the most popular exotic dancer in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' the Rev. W.V. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said into the loudspeaker system of the Eagle's Nest Cathedral. `` And from now on, she's going to be called the Reverend <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Messerole </PERSON>.'' The former stripper for <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>'s Carousel nightclub was ordained during a Sunday night service before the red-carpeted altar of the sprawling church. `` I'm finally delivered from everything. I'm really with the Lord,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Meserole </PERSON>, 54. `` I'm not with other people anymore. I'm just a different person.'' As a girl, Ms. <PERSON> Meserole </PERSON> said, she dreamed of becoming a nun named sister <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>. She attended a private <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school until her father made her quit when she was 13. She worked at a drug store, and then at a hospital before falling on hard times and moving into show business at 22. She was a stripper at <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>'s club in downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and was married to a locally popular comedian who once got into a fight with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> for heckling during an act and calling her husband a communist. She was still working as a stripper at the Carousel when, on Sunday morning, Nov. 24, 1963, she turned on her television the weekend of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination and saw her boss pull a gun and fatally shoot <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> in the basement of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police station. By the time she was 35, she said, she turned to prostitution, to alcohol and later to pills. Four years ago, while under treatment at an <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> hospital, she turned to God. `` I'm writing a book to help other people like me that were sick and beat and were left for dead, so they do n't have to live through that,'' Ms. <PERSON> Meserole </PERSON> said. `` During a year in the sanitarium, I saw a lot of people and they can be healed and my story will help.'' She said she plans to preach, beginning with a downtown rally later this month. But most of her work as an ordained minister of <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s charismatic <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deliverance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> will involve counseling others. `` I'll go wherever the Lord leads me, but the county jail is what I've got in my heart right now,'' she said. `` I want to go and talk to the prostitutes and the alcoholics and the people with all kind of problems.'' She now spends six days a week cleaning homes for a living, and said she did n't expect that to change much after the Sunday night service. It's a far cry from the late 1950s and early'60s at the Carousel, when she would dance along a runway, stripping to a G-string and pasties as the top act in town. `` But it's still exciting in a different way,'' she said. `` And it's a whole different life.'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, whose church recently moved into its huge hillside complex on <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> west side, said Ms. <PERSON> Meserole </PERSON>'s message will be heard by those he and other preachers ca n't reach. `` She can walk up to them and say, ` I know what you're going through,''' he said.

 <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s extreme right leader, refused to endorse conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> but told supporters not to vote for President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the May 8 presidential runoff election. `` We are in a position of choosing between the bad and the worst,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> told 30,000 of his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> followers in the Tuileries Gardens in the heart of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, who ran on an anti-immigration, `` French first'' platform, was eliminated along with six other candidates in first-round voting April 24, but his surprisingly strong showing means his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> followers could influence the outcome of the runoff. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> called the runoff vote on May 8 `` a formality'' _ the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mitterrand </ORGANIZATION> is widely considered a cinch to win. The right-wing candidate told his supporters to organize for the future. `` Once the people of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> are informed, we will be the majority,'' he said. Hundreds of riot police sealed off the area, fearing clashes with tens of thousands of unionists protesting <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> in countermarches. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> called his rally to honor May Day and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> of Arc, advancing her traditional feast day by a week because of the May 8 election. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> has appropriated <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> of Arc as a National Front symbol. Supporters first marched through the center of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, then moved to the lushly green Tuileries where a Roman Catholic Mass was said in Latin. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, 59, took 14.4 percent of the first-round vote, worrying many who fear the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> could awaken racist sentiments. Since April 24, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> has tried to attract <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s following, stressing the need to stop immigration and conserve <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s national identity _ top themes of <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> who claims that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, inundated by immigrants from former North African colonies, is being drained economically, socially and culturally <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> president a traitor for his views on immigrants and separatists in the strife-torn territory of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. `` No. No. No. Not a single vote for <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> said from his rain-drenched stage in the elegant gardens overlooking the Place de la Concorde and the Arch of Triumph. But <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> avoided a straight `` yes'' or `` no'' on <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, whom he referred to as the `` residual candidate.'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> spelled out three possibilities for his followers: stay home, vote for <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> `` to avoid the worst,'' or decide at the last minute depending on <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s statements in the final week of the campaign. `` If <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> is defeated, he has only himself, his friends and his allies to blame,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> said. `` We have no responsibility in the voting.''

<HEAD>Japanese Stocks Close At Record High; Dollar Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices rose across the board today in the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> while the dollar closed stronger. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the market's main barometer, closed at a record high of 27,669.72, or 160.18 points higher than Saturday's close. Volume was estimated at a moderate 900 million shares. Traders said electronics shares, such as <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION>, were rising. `` Many institutional investors are on vacation so today's bullishness is largely caused by private investors,'' said a broker at a major Japanese securities firm `` They -LRB- private investors -RRB- are expecting share prices to soar after Golden Week. So, they want to make sure they buy shares beforehand,'' said the dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity. Golden Week is the seven-day stretch that began Friday in which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> celebrates four national holidays. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> foreign exchange market was closed Friday and all banks, financial institutions, markets and most businesses will be closed Tuesday through Thursday for the holidays. `` The major shift will show up after the holiday,'' the broker added. Meanwhile, the dollar also rose to close the day's dealings at 125.33 yen, up 0.51 yen from Thursday's close of 124.82 yen. `` The general trend is the strong dollar, but there are hardly any major moves at all,'' said <PERSON> Hiroaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Shukuzawa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` The market saw recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic indicators as favorable and the dollar regained the losses it suffered after the poor showings of the last month's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures.''

<HEAD>Lines Form As Illegal Aliens Make Last-Minute Applications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Undocumented aliens hoping to legalize their status have flocked to immigration offices as the application deadline nears, and some officials believe the cost of filing kept them away until the last minute. `` You ca n't help but ask these people, ` What have you been doing the last 11 months?''' said <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, an official of the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, legalization office, referring to the duration of the amnesty program. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> attributed the surge in last-minute applications to procrastination and fear about the program. He said Sunday that his office processed over 300 applications last week. Undocumented aliens face a midnight Wednesday deadline to file applications for legal status under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. They must prove continuous residency in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since Jan. 1, 1982. Filing is the first step toward citizenship. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, handled about 250 applications Saturday and Sunday, said spokesman <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>, who believed many more would have shown up had they expected the office to be open through the weekend. `` This whole month we have processed 1,858 people, which is almost what we did in the first three or four months of the program,'' <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> said some applicants slept outside the center to complete paperwork and wait for a work permit rather than file applications and set a date for a later appointment. `` They're getting desperate because they've waited too long, and some are still looking for additional paperwork and they're finding out they do n't have the documents,'' said <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>. `` And a lot of them do n't have the money -LRB- for the filing fee -RRB-, let's face it.'' More than 1,000 illegal aliens applied in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last week _ fewer than expected, officials said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, officer in charge of the office, said the poor <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> economy may have made it tough for some applicants to come up with the filing fee of $ 185 a person or up to $ 420 per family. He also cited the mobility of the illegal alien population for the smaller than expected number of applicants. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, officials believe the number of applications will exceed the revised target of 100,000. They cited a sharp upturn in the number of aliens crowding <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> offices in recent days. One illegal immigrant who applied last week, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 38, said receiving legal status means being able to work without fear on a western <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> farm. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said he paid to be smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from his native <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1972. `` I can look any man in the eye now and not be afraid,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. `` I can walk straight, as a man should. The burden has been lifted off my shoulders.'' Wednesday's deadline does not apply to aliens applying for legal status under the Seasonal Agricultural Worker provision of the immigration reform act. They have until Nov. 30. With the amnesty program about to end, the government is preparing to shift the emphasis to employers. The immigration reform act mandates sanctions against employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers. Starting June 1, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has the discretion to issue warning citations or fine employers who violate the law. Currently, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> must initially issue warning citations.

<HEAD>Two Bombs Explode In Barcelona; 16 Hurt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two bombs exploded early today in this northeastern port city, injuring 16 people, two of them seriously. A separatist group told a local newspaper it had planted the bombs. Police said one bomb placed near a window of a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> exploded at 2:05 a.m. -LRB- 8:05 p.m. EDT Sunday -RRB- and shattered the bank's windows. Soon after authorities arrived, a second bomb with more than four pounds of shrapnel exploded in a nearby garbage container, injuring 16 people. Two of them, a national policeman and a paramilitary civil guard, were hospitalized with serious leg injuries. The other 14, including four firemen and ten civilians, were treated for cuts at a local hospital and released. The group Free Land, which supports independence for the four-province region of <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION>, of which <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> is the capital, took responsibility for the two blasts in a telephone call to the local Avui newspaper. The group has claimed responsibility for several attacks in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, including a March 17 explosion at the British Consulate, a bomb blast outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> last October and two attacks on American businesses in 1987.

<HEAD>Three Officials Offer To Take Place Of New Caledonia Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three rightist elected officials today offered to change places with 21 hostages held by Melanesian militants, but the main separatist group ridiculed the proposal. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ukeiwe </PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> in the French <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said he and two members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Nenou </PERSON>, wished to `` take the place of the hostages to bring an end to their ordeal and to assume fully our responsibilities.'' A group of Melanesians who killed four gendarmes in an attack April 22 are still holding 21 officers hostage in a cave on <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, a small island off the eastern coast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, minister for overseas territories in Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s conservative government, endorsed the proposed exchange and <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Leques </PERSON> ordered all offices, shops and bars in the capital closed at 4 p.m. -LRB- 1 a.m. EDT -RRB- in support of the idea. The <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, known by its French initatials <ORGANIZATION> FLNKS </ORGANIZATION>, dismissed the offer and reiterated the demand for a mediator with authority from <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to negotiate a referendum on independence for the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island territory. <PERSON> Hnalaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Uregei </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> FLNKS </ORGANIZATION> political bureau, told reporters the exchange proposal was `` at the same time grotesque, ridiculous and indecent.'' On Sunday, the front rejected Monsignor <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvet </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archbishop of <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, as a mediator to negotiate the release of the hostages. `` We want someone who would be representative of the colonial power, who would have authority to commit the colonial power,'' <PERSON> Uregei </PERSON> said today. Uregei, <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nenou </PERSON> are all members of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s rightist party, the Rally for the Republic, and among the most prominent opponents of the separatist movement. Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s 145,000 population. About 36 percent of the population is <LOCATION> European </LOCATION>, and the others are mostly Asian or Tahitian. The FNLKS is opposed to <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s plan for giving partial autonomy to the territory, as endorsed last year in a referendum boycotted by the separatists. On April 22, the rebels raided a post of the gendarmerie _ police under military command _ seizing 27 officers and killing four. Twelve hostages were released, but eight others taken, including the head of an anti-terrorism squad and an assistant prosecutor. The prosecutor and the anti-terrorism squad leader were freed and ordered to negotiate on behalf of the terrorists, but told the remaining hostages would be killed if the two men did not return to the cave hideout. Because of that threat, authorities still consider the two as hostages, for a total of 23.

<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s refusal to stop appearing on two television shows produced by his ministry led the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> to drop the programs, a <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` We had given <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> by mail a period of time to decide whether to comply with our request that he not appear in the shows,'' <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Weirich </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Va.-based cable TV network, said Sunday. `` If he was n't -LRB- going to appear -RRB- we would continue to carry the shows. But we were notified that he thought that was not in the best interest of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s evangelical association,'' said <PERSON> Weirich </PERSON>. The decision deprives <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> of the largest network carrying his shows. <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> carries religious shows, children's shows, documentaries, reruns of old TV series and family entertainment to nearly 37 million homes, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministry paid to air the shows, which had an average viewership of 40,000 to 80,000 homes, said <PERSON> Weirich </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. On Sunday, the network canceled the weekly hour-long broadcast of services from <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> church. It also pulled a weekday morning Bible study called `` A Study in the Word,'' which was replaced with a half-hour animated children's show of Bible stories called `` Flying House.'' The cancellations follow <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s refusal to accept a yearlong preaching suspension ordered by national directors of the Assembies of God denomination. That followed a three-month suspension by the Assemblies' <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> directors after <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> confessed publicly to unspecified sins, which reportedly involved voyeurism with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> prostitute. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has said he will resume preaching May 22. In the letter to <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> about two weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> offered to retain the programs if he remained off them for the year, <PERSON> Weirich </PERSON> said. A spokesman for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> could not be reached because he does not take calls on weekends. According to figures released by <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> last month, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s weekly show had an audience of 1.961 million households in February and the daily show was watched by 323,000 households On Sunday, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, promising he would try to never again criticize anyone, appealed for $ 6 million to save <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> <PERSON> Ministeries </PERSON> during one of his few national television appearances since his unexplained `` moral failure.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who was joined by his wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, and son, <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON>, said he was appearing neither as a preacher nor a teacher. He said he was continuing to abide by his self-imposed, 90-day ban on those activities. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did not talk about his alleged indiscretion or his troubles with the Assemblies of God during the taped, hour-long telecast. It aired in time slots that had featured <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> preaching until his confession Feb. 1. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said the ministry's budget was devastated by his problems. `` We have to raise the funds if we are to keep the ministry going,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said. `` Stations will cancel if we can not pay them. We can not pay them what we do not have.''

<HEAD>Disabled War Veteran Begins Attempt to Cross Nation in Sailplane</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran who lost both legs in combat took off in a sailplane in a 2,500-mile attempt to become the first person to glide across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The sailplane Eagle, with pilot <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, 41, at the controls, was lifted into the air by a tow plane Sunday at <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> near the Mexican border. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> is trying to raise nearly $ 50,000 in pledges to help maintain the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, a nationally ranked sailplane competitor and English professor, hopes to average about 200 miles a day, reaching <LOCATION> Kitty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hawk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> _ the birthplace of aviation _ on May 19. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> plans to glide his 15-foot-long craft back to the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Motor Speedway, landing inside the racetrack grounds, to wave the starting flag for the May 22 Winston Cup <ORGANIZATION> NASCAR </ORGANIZATION> stock car race. Others have tried similar flights, but have been forced to complete part of the trip by hauling their sailplanes on a trailer, he said. `` I'm not real concerned with whether I accomplish being the first person to fly -LRB- a glider -RRB- the entire distance; I'm in it for the challenge of making the flight,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said before takeoff. Since taking up the sport six years ago, <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> has conducted one `` soar-a-thon'' a year to benefit charity. This is his first transcontinental attempt, however, and he said the purpose makes it even more special. `` I think the Vietnam Memorial is one of the most important monuments we have. It's an opportunity for people to heal about the war and come to grips with their feelings about <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. `` Every veteran I know who is still alive feels he's part of that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Monument,'' said <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, who lost his legs in a 1967 morter attack that took the lives of six of his buddies and wounded another 18. Proceeds from flight pledges will be given to Friends of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial, a nonprofit group which helps maintain the monument and assists in memorials for familes of deceased veterans. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> has developed artificial legs that clamp onto his glider's foot controls. He said he became hooked on gliding when he saw his first one in flight 10 years ago. `` I do n't even like planes that have engines or gas because when I was in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> I saw too many planes go down in flames,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. `` I feel more secure in a plane with no fuel and no engine.''

 The dollar rose in thin European trading today, helped by new interest in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> traders who reappeared briefly on the market. Gold prices fell. East Asian markets came back to life today as market players returned to trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for one day before going into another three-day holiday spell. The markets were closed in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Friday for Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s birthday. Most major Japanese financial institutions are to be closed May 3-5. Dealers said East Asian players were reacting belatedly to the Friday report that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> index of leading economic indicators for March rose 0.8 percent. A 4 percent increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> single-family home sales for March reported Friday also had a favorable impact on trading, as did news that two small <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks had raised their prime lending rate to 8.75 percent from 8.5 percent. In addition, traders were opening new positions at the beginning of the month, which was boosting the dollar, dealers said. However, trading was thin because foreign exchange and bullion markets were closed today in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for a bank holiday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.51 yen to a closing 125.33 from 124.82 yen on Thursday. Later, in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 125.28 yen.

Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 2.06 to close at a bid $ 450.30.

 An editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> journal <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flag </ORGANIZATION> said it will be replaced by a livelier new magazine that readers will enjoy. Red Flag, for decades the definitive account of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political theory, will cease publication June 16 and be replaced July 1 by the magazine Seek Truth The new title comes from a favorite slogan of Chinese leaders: `` Seek truth from facts.'' The new magazine `` will firmly implement the policy of ` let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend' and have lively theoretical discussion,'' said <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Xing </PERSON>, Red Flag's associate editor The `` 100 flowers'' slogan refers to <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s 1957 call for intellectuals to freely voice criticisms of the party. The campaign was followed in 1958 by a severe crackdown. `` In short ... we will publish a lively magazine that readers will enjoy reading,'' Su, 30, said in an interview in the official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>. Sources said last December that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretariat </ORGANIZATION> decided to stop publishing Red Flag because other publications have taken over its role as the voice of the party.

However, it was increasingly ignored as it gained a reputation for supporting the old-guard conservative line being displaced by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s more pragmatic, reform-minded leaders.

 Thirteen members of the Bandidos motorcycle gang were arrested and eight others were being sought on federal explosives and conspiracy charges stemming from two 1983 bombings, an official said. Among those arrested Saturday in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> were top leaders of the national gang, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>. The suspects are accused of staging the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area bombings in retaliation for an earlier 1983 clash with the rival <PERSON> Banche </PERSON> gang, <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said. The bikers were named in a 23-count sealed indictment returned March 31 by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, he said. Two other Bandidos members named in the indictment were already in custody, <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said. A bomb placed near the gas meter of a home in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> exploded July 5, 1983. Later that day in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, a man and his 1-year-old daughter received minor injuries when a bomb exploded inside the van they were in. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said the blasts were believed intended for members of the Banches. `` Earlier in the year, in the spring of 1983, the Banches and the Bandidos got into an altercation in <LOCATION> Porter </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, that resulted in one Bandido member being killed and several members of each club being wounded,'' he said. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said a three-year investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> turned up evidence that the bombings were retaliatiory. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> is about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Those arrested include <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON>, age unknown, of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, identified by authorities as the <ORGANIZATION> Bandidos </ORGANIZATION>' national president; <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmick </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, national vice president; and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pruett </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, national secretary-treasurer. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said all face federal explosives and related conspiracy charges and some may face further charges. The maximum federal penalty for receiving or possessing destructive devices is 10 years imprisonment and a $ 250,000 fine on each count. The maximum penalty for the conspirarcy charge is five years and a $ 250,000 fine.

<HEAD>Economy Expanding Again, Purchasing Managers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The economy reversed a three-month slowdown in April as production and new orders picked up sharply, according to a survey of purchasing managers. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Managers </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group with about 30,000 members, said its index of economic activity released Sunday rose to 54.9 percent last month from 53.3 percent in March. The index had declined the first three months of the year, indicating a slowing in economic growth. A reading above 50 percent generally indicates economic expansion, while a reading below that benchmark indicates the economy is declining, the group says. For the first four months of this year, the index has averaged 55.1 percent. The April increase was sparked by a surge in production. Thirty-seven percent of the 250 purchasing managers surveyed reported increased production at their companies, while 53 percent said output remained the same as in March and 10 percent said it fell. In March, 29 percent of the respondents said production was up. Another factor boosting the index was an increase in new orders. Thirty-seven percent of the respondents said they had more new orders, compared with 29 percent in March. Forty-nine percent said orders were running at the same rate of March and 14 percent said they had fewer new orders. New orders tend to signal how well the economy will fare in succeeding month. April's economic expansion was forecast by a surge in new orders in March.

 <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas who killed three British soldiers and injured three in a car bombing and an ambush may have escaped from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, police said today. `` It is easy to escape,'' police spokesman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Steens </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Roermond </LOCATION>, six miles from the West German border. He said it takes `` a short time to get away'' through relatively open borders with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. One British airman was killed and two injured in this southeastern city when their car was sprayed with automatic weapons fire early Sunday morning. An hour later, a car bomb in <LOCATION> Nieuwbergen </LOCATION>, 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Roermond </LOCATION>, exploded, killing two British airmen and severely injured a third. Police said the two attacks on the six servicemen, who were visiting from their bases in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, were closely coordinated. There are no border controls for passenger cars crossing the Dutch-Belgian border 30 miles from <LOCATION> Roermond </LOCATION>. The West German border is more tightly controlled but also has some unmanned crossings at night. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks were the group's first in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> since the 1979 slaying of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ambassador. British forces in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were told today to take extra precautions when traveling in or near the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Signs at border crossings near <LOCATION> Roermond </LOCATION> said `` BFG -LRB- British Forces in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- Persons Advised Not To Enter Holland.'' The Irish, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> governments immediately condemned the attacks on the British soldiers. The British government said the six airmen were off duty and unarmed when attacked. In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility on Sunday. <PERSON> Steens </PERSON> told reporters today that `` there were a few witnesses who spoke about a person they saw'' in <LOCATION> Roermond </LOCATION> when three <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> enlisted men were fired on after getting into their car parked outside a local cafe. `` It was a man,'' Steens said. Senior Aircraftsman <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinner </PERSON>, 20, died instantly, while a fellow airman was listed in serious condition at a local hospital and a third was treated for minor shoulder injuries. The injured men were not identified. In the <LOCATION> Nieuwbergen </LOCATION> attack the car carrying the three service was torn apart by the blast as it pulled out of the parking lot of a discotheque. Two airmen _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, 21 _ were killed and a third, who was not identified was severely injured. Police appeared at a loss for clues to the trail of the assailants, and at the news conference declined to confirm reports that the explosion that wrecked the car at <LOCATION> Nieuwbergen </LOCATION> was caused by a bomb. Both border towns are frequent recreation destinations for British troops stationed in West German border bases. The blast, which could be heard up to five miles away, caused a fireball `` higher than the shops'' said <PERSON> Henk </PERSON> <PERSON> Mennink </PERSON>, who runs a nearby snack bar. `` You could see two bodies hanging on the front seats, and pieces of skin were lying at my door,'' <PERSON> Mennink </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. The victims were in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> for local festivities marking the official 50th birthday of Dutch Queen <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON>. Both their cars carried British license plates. Police evacuated homes in <LOCATION> Nieuwbergen </LOCATION> on Sunday and searched other British-registered cars for possible bombs. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claim of responsibility was received by media in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The group's message said: `` We have a simple message for -LRB- <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister -RRB- Mrs. -LRB- <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>: Disengage from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and there will be peace. If not, there will be no haven for your military personnel and you will regularly be at airports awaiting your dead.'' The message was an apparent reference to the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> leader's highly publicized March 23 trip to a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base for the return of the bodies of two British soldiers killed four days earlier at an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> The victims from Sunday's shooting attack were based at a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Wildenrath </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and were members of 16 Squadron <ORGANIZATION> RAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, which mans the Rapier anti-aircraft defense. The car bomb victims were from the <ORGANIZATION> RAF </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Laarbruch </LOCATION> base in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Their unit was not immediately known.

 The government will consider whether servicemen should continue using special British license plates following the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s slaying of three airmen in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, a minister said today. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has threatened to kill more British servicemen following Sunday's attacks in which three airmen also were injured. The six servicemen were traveling in two cars with special license plates. One car was sprayed with machine-gun fire. The other was destoyed by a bomb. Several British lawmakers have criticized the license plates as a `` giveaway'' to terrorists. Armed Forces Minister <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> was asked in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio interview whether their continued use would be looked at as part of the security review promised on Sunday by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON>. `` Yes, it certainly will,'' he said. `` There are a number of aspects we want to look into and that is certainly one of them. We will want to draw any possible lessons from these attacks.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said the government would look into anything it could do `` to tighten up the security or increase the potential safety of our lads.'' The six servicemen, visiting the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> from their bases in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, were unarmed and off duty when attacked, British officials said. On Sunday and today, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> aired warnings to soldiers and airmen who were away from their bases in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>: `` Terrorists only look at you for one reason. Be alert. Stay alive.'' The three men killed were identified by the British <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinner </PERSON>, 20, who was machine-gunned in <LOCATION> Roermond </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, 21, who were blown up in their car in <LOCATION> Nieuwbergen </LOCATION>. All three were senior airmen in the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> which guards air bases. They were visiting Dutch discotheques and bars just across the border which stay open later than German ones. The three airmen were believed to be the first British military fatalities caused by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> on the European continent. There had been attacks on British bases but no deaths. Sunday's killings also ended a 14-month lull in <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks outside <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the deaths with a statement through the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publicity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, saying it had a `` simple message'' for <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>: `` Disengage from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and there will be peace. If not, then there will be no haven for your military personnel and you will regularly be at airports awaiting your dead.'' The message referred to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s much publicized visit to <ORGANIZATION> Northolt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on March 23 for the return of the bodies of two British soldiers lynched in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> by mourners at an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral which they had driven into. The killings were seen as retaliation for the March 6 shootings by British security forces of three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> on March 6. The army said the guerrillas were preparing to bomb an army parade. The British armed forces have nearly 70,000 personnel and 80,000 dependants stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at four <ORGANIZATION> RAF </ORGANIZATION> and five army bases. Since launching its violent campaign to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1969, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has killed 392 British soldiers there and 24 in mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The known death toll in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is 2,642, according to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police. It includes 253 police officers, 174 militia of the British-trained <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> and 1,823 civilians. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has a network of support in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In 1986, Dutch police arrested two major <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> figures who were involved in a 1983 escape from <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s Maze prison and had spent several years in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>.

 New water rules have started for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s 750,000 customers, but it will be at least two weeks before residents find out how much water they will be alloted without penalty. `` I would encourage -LRB- residents -RRB- to start saving water now and not panic until they see how much they will get,'' said city Water Department Manager <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON>. Eventual penalties could include higher rates. The water rationing plan that has a goal of a 25 percent cutback in useage started on Sunday, a day of dazzling spring sunshine. The water rules adopted last week by the city's <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> prohibits hosing down sidewalks, using hoses without shutoff valves to wash cars, operating decorative fountains and automatic service of water to restaurant customers. The water-conservation regulations are the first for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> since the 1976-77 drought.

 Detailed analysis of a jetliner that had part of its fuselage blown off while flying at 24,000 feet found cracks apparently caused by metal fatigue, a federal official said. `` What appears preliminarily to be fatigue cracking'' was found at six rivet holes on a metal strip running the length of the aircraft, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said at a news conference Sunday night. The cracks, measuring 0.2 to 0.6 inch, were discovered on the metal strip, called the No. 10 stringer, that ran above the passenger windows on the left side of the <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said all of the plane's rivets, as well as those on <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON>'s other 737s, were being tested electronically in an effort to find any other cracks In an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said that although the general question of metal fatigue in older jetliners has been discussed and debated in the industry for years, the safety board viewed the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident as calling `` significant attention'' to the problem. The plane made an emergency landing Thursday at the airport in this <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> town. The flight from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> carried 95 people, including 89 passengers. Twenty feet of the plane's upper fuselage covering first class passengers tore away. A flight attendant who had worked 37 years with <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clarabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, apparently was sucked from the plane to her death, while 61 other people were injured. Seven remained at <ORGANIZATION> Maui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday in stable condition with burns and lacerations, nursing supervisor <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Perreira </PERSON> said. The seven, who were sitting in the area of the rupture, mainly in window seats, received their cuts from jagged sections of what remained of the fuselage, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. They also suffered wind burn, he said. Only 30 percent of the fuselage remained intact at the point of the rupture. <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said tests found that repairs made last November to two cracks in the plane's No. 4 stringer, located farther up the fuselage, appeared to have held. A service bulletin issued by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in April told airlines to look for corroding fasteners that hold pieces of the fuselage together. Close inspection of the upper skin of early-model <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s was ordered Oct. 5 by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> after routine inspections turned up cracks near where sections of sheet metal overlap, officials said Friday. The agency warned the problem could cause rapid cabin decompression, they said. Inspections carried out because of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order turned up nothing unusual, said <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>. In the wake of the accident, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has barred some of the oldest versions of the 737 from flying above 23,000 feet. The order affects 66 plans, operated by <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> airlines, that have made more than 55,000 landings. The Aloha plane, in service since 1969, had made 85,000 to 90,000 landings. Air and sea searchs failed to located any trace of the missing fuselage section, officials said. The section tore away while the first officer, <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>, was flying the plane at 322 mph to 333 mph, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said Saturday. The flight crew donned oxygen masks as <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> turned the controls over Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON>, he said. The plane hit the runway at 195 mph, 45 mph faster than a normal landing, because Schornstheimer found the jet's flaps, used for deceleration, would not work properly, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said.

 A member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, criticizing `` confused'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, called on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration today to bring <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations together to pressure <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign. `` There's been no multilateral effort,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America. `` There's been no effort to create a Central American solution.'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and intelligence officials have been at odds with the administration's diplomatic and economic efforts to oust the Panamanian strongman, who `` has known since the beginning that there's been a divided administration.'' `` There's been no process of building a congressional and an administration bipartisan foreign policy here, as we did for instance in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has also been bolstered by the lack of opposition to his rule from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s neighbors, he said. `` If we were to isolate <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> further from the support, the small support he is currently getting,'' said <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, `` if we were to bring pressure to bear from other Central American countries, so that he knows there is a united front against him, which he is aware does not exist today, you would increase your leverage.'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>'s criticism came after reports this weekend that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was negotiating a deal for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign but remain in the country. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Sunday that talks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> aimed at his removal from power are continued this weekend, but he said only `` progress is being made.'' Interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he could not discuss whether <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be allowed to remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, saying the talks were `` sensitive'' and were going on `` as we talk.'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s commerce minister said Sunday that drug trafficking charges must be dropped against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> before serious negotiations can take place. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approach in the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> negotiations also was criticized Sunday by Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, a top Republican foreign policy expert in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s anti-Noriega ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he expected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal of removing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to be met but declined to predict when or under what circumstances. `` I do n't think it would be helpful for me to ... get into hypothetical questions about leaving power, staying in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or leaving power and getting out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said. He said the announcement Saturday that the 40,000 Americans living in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> could pay utility, garbage and other bills to the Noriega-controlled government so services could be resumed was not a lifting of sanctions. He said such exemptions were contemplated in the original orders cutting off public and private payments to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Administration officials said Friday that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had agreed during private talks with a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration envoy to step down but not leave the country. However, the deal was denied by officials in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Commerce Minister <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Rognoni </PERSON> on Sunday called the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug trafficking charges a `` political ploy.'' `` What we see is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> acting as kind of a terrorist group now, where they are trying to hold hostage General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by discrediting him, by making a political indictment, and then trying to release the hostage by getting some changes to your benefit,'' said <PERSON> Rognoni </PERSON> in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' `` For us, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has to withdraw a political indictment that was set to have him as hostage of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy, and after that indictment is taken care of, then we can sit and discuss anything you want with relation to the U.S.-Panama relationship,'' said <PERSON> Rognoni </PERSON>. Also appearing in separate interviews on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program were <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind.; Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., and <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should keep open the `` military option'' for changing <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s government but should not use force or make a deal with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> without support from Panamanians and other Latin American countries. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be working with others rather than `` having a unilateral emissary going back and forth, sometimes without the apparent support of all elements of our government.'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> also pushed for more regional involvement in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and said it would be `` a very severe mistake'' to use military force in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` The Panamanian defense forces are not to be taken lightly,'' he said. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who supports ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` are not meaningful'' for the opposition because `` the notion of him staying in the country is unacceptable.'' `` Drastic actions of an economic nature, of a political nature, and some sort of military action will be needed to get him out,'' the envoy said. The military action, he said, should be by Panamanians.

Cmdr. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Michener </PERSON> told a congregation of about 500 at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday. `` We are brought together by nothing else than the sea,'' he said, adding `` we remember in sadness at our loss _ a son, a brother, family members, crew members. `` We are also here to remember in joy ... and give thanksgiving for the lives of our brothers,'' he added. The April 24 explosion and fire aboard the USS Bonefish off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast killed three sailors and injured 22 others among the 92-member crew of the diesel electric submarine. Funerals for Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Everts </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Naoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordelon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 39, of <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Pisgah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, were held over the weekend. During the memorial service under the white Gothic arches of the church on the edge of the city's historic district, the crew of the Bonefish dressed in their somber winter blue uniforms as a sign of mourning. Other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel in the congregation wore their summer whites. `` We loved these three valiant men,'' said Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Submarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION> _ the group to which the Bonefish was assigned. `` Thank God for men like them who know the price of liberty.'' Vice Adm. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> submarine forces said `` it is all the men of the Bonefish we honor today.'' `` The miracle is that 89 men were rescued and the ship returned to port through the heroic, professional and unselfish acts of others,'' he added. The Bonefish was on exercises off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast at the time of the accident. She was towed back to shore, arriving at the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> on Friday. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation into the cause of the accident is under way, said Lt.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> blasts and staccato bursts of gunfire shook the capital today as police reported 12 people died and 35 were wounded in factional fighting in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> refugee camps and neighboring Shiite Moslem slums. Meanwhile, the synod of <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops met in an emergency session at the residence of the community's patriarch to investigate the kidnapping, torture and killing of Monsignor <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Khreish </PERSON>, 53, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiritual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting was chaired by the <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, patriarch of the 850,000 Maronites who make up <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest Christian community. Police said <PERSON> Khreish </PERSON>'s bullet-riddled body was found Sunday by a bird hunter in a pine tree forest near the Christian resort town of <LOCATION> Ghazir </LOCATION>. Gunmen kidnapped the priest from his home in <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, a Christian port north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, on April 26. He was in his pajamas when his body was found. <PERSON> Khreish </PERSON> was the nephew of Cardinal <PERSON> Mar </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonios </PERSON> <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Khreish </PERSON>, the Maronites' former patriarch. Police said there were scars indicating physical torture on <PERSON> Khreish </PERSON>'s face and that he had been shot at least 30 times. They had no immediate indication as to the reason for his abduction and slaying in an area controlled by the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the victim's sister is the wife of the elder brother of <PERSON> Nayef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader who heads the Moscow-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. `` But no one can ascertain whether this has anything to do with the murder,'' one source said. The Lebanese Forces militia is a bitter enemy of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, who have fought alongside other Moslems in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 13-year-old civil war Police said gunfire and shell blasts in <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh refugee camps began Sunday and continued today between <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and Syrian-backed dissidents. It was the first major clash between the two sides since <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s reconciliation meeting with Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> last week. Police said they had no word on what touched off the clash. They said both sides fired mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns. At least two people were killed and 15 wounded in the two camps in southern <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the police report said. Ten people were killed and 20 wounded in fighting Sunday and early today between two Shiite Moslem groups in the slums of Raml el-Aali and <PERSON> Roweisse </PERSON>, police said. Police said fighters of the Atat and <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> clans were battling for local dominance in the two neighborhoods that adjoin <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s airport highway. Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s Amal militia, the Shiites' main paramilitary force, moved in after after midnight Sunday in a bid to end the fighting. An <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> communique ordered both clans to lay down their arms and withdraw from the streets and said violators would be shot. South <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s slums are outside the jurisdiction of a 7,500-strong Syrian army contingent posted in the Moslem sector of the Lebanese capital. The force has restored some measure of order in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, which had been plagued by kidnappings, assassinations and bank robberies since the civil war began in 1975.

<TEXT>
 A millionaire boatyard owner convicted in the contract killing of his wife hated prison and killed himself when an escape plan was foiled, his attorney and friends said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON> was imprisoned for hiring two men who answered an advertisement in Soldier of Fortune magazine to kill his wife, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON>. He hanged himself Saturday in his single confinement cell at <ORGANIZATION> Polk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, three days after authorities thwarted a helicopter escape plan, said state corrections spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Macmaster </PERSON>. `` He was always talking about getting out, that he could n't stand it,'' said longtime friend <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenno </PERSON> The attempted breakout also did not come as a complete surprise to another friend nor to his attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON> is approaching 60 and serving a sentence which would not permit him to be released until he's in his 80s,'' said <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON>. `` Someone in his position would not have a great deal to lose.'' <PERSON> Dyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a friend, said the escape attempt was `` not out of character.'' `` He's the type of person who does what he wants to, when he wants to,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON>, 60, had been sentenced to life plus 20 years. `` He had tied one end of the bedsheet around his neck and the other to the top bars in his confinement cell,'' <PERSON> Macmaster </PERSON> said. `` He was in the cell because he was an escape risk _ nobody thought he would kill himself.'' The suicide came after authorities uncovered his escape plans, an elaborate scheme that included escape by stolen helicopter from the <ORGANIZATION> Zephyrhills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, where he had been serving his sentence until Monday. Two undercover agents from the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> posing as pilots received $ 4,700 as a down payment on a $ 54,700 contract to steal a helicopter and fly <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON> out of the prison, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FDLE </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON> asked the undercover agents to have two machine guns and four hand grenades aboard the helicopter, authorities said. He intended to use the grenades to kill his prosecutor, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Moria </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasch </PERSON>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FDLE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON> was charged with attempted escape and weapons offenses. <PERSON> Stepson </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, a suspected accomplice, was charged with the same offenses but remained at large, authorities said.

<HEAD>March Gain Biggest in Almost a Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction spending, powered by a big gain in government projects, shot up 1.5 percent in March, the biggest increase in almost a year. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that construction spending rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 401.8 billion in March following a 0.4 percent increase in February. The March advance was the biggest since a 2 percent gain in April 1987 and reflected increases in all of the major categories. The advance was led by a 5.4 percent surge in spending on government building projects, which climbed to an annual rate of $ 82.3 billion, 8.1 percent higher than a year ago. Highway construction, the biggest single government category, posted a 7 percent increase to an annual rate of $ 27.6 billion. Residential construction rose 0.8 percent in March to an annual rate of $ 191.4 billion as a 2 percent increase in single-family construction was nearly offset by a 3.6 percent decline in multi-family construction. Non-residential construction edged up 0.3 percent to an annaul rate of $ 92.3 billion with industrial construction, office building and hotel construction all recording gains. The February and March increases followed declines of 2.3 percent in January and 0.02 percent in December. Analysts are looking for only moderate strength in construction this year because of widespread over-building of offices and apartments.

<HEAD>Court to Hear Administration Plea in Tax Case Involving Canadian
Citizens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to hear a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appeal aimed at making it easier for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to turn over tax information to a foreign government. The court said it will review a ruling that limited access by Canadian officials to financial records of two Canadian citizens with bank accounts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION>, the equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> here, sought records of <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mons </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapoor </PERSON>. Both Canadian citizens have accounts with the <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. The Canadian officials said they are investigating the two men's tax liability for 1980, 1981 and 1982 The officials sought the help of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government under a 1942 treaty between the two nations, and the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> issued summonses to the bank in 1984. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kapoor </PERSON> then asked a federal judge to block the summonses. The judge declined, but the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in their favor last year. The appeals court ordered the bank records withheld unless <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials state the Canadian tax investigation has not reached a stage analogous to one in this country in which the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> would refer the case to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for criminal prosecution. `` We do not believe that requiring the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to make such a statement will unduly restrict the service's summonsing authority or impede enforcement of summonses,'' the appeals court said. But administration lawyers said the ruling could hinder <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> treaty obligations and impair the ability of investigators here to obtain foreign financial records. The ruling `` requires a treaty partner's tax investigation to meet standards grounded in domestic policies that have no application in the treaty partner's jurisdiction,'' the government's appeal said. `` It unnecessarily hinders investigations that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has pledged by treaty to assist and that are entirely proper under the laws of the treaty partner,'' the appeal added. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has such tax treaties with 31 foreign governments and also exchanges information under other agreements reached with <LOCATION> Carribean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> nations. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 87-1064.

He said the aircraft lost the use of one engine over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> approximately one hour and 15 minutes before landing, a second engine about 30 minutes later and a third engine just prior to landing. <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> said the captain requested and was granted an `` expedited approach and emergency vehicles standing by.'' The aircraft taxied under its own power to the terminal and the passengers left the plane in a `` normal fashion,'' he said. <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> said the cause of the engine failures was under investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, reached at home in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> this morning, said he had n't heard of the incident but was n't surprised the jet was able to land safely. `` Almost any aircraft we have is capable of operating on one engine,'' he said. However, he said he did n't know of any other 747 losing power in three engines. A <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official at the airport, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the aircraft flew to <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> rather than other airports in northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because the captain believed he could reach it safely. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted passengeers as saying they were frightened when told by the crew to put on life jackets and instructed in their use. `` We thought the plane would crash into the sea and we would be killed'' <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> quoted Japanese passenger <PERSON> Tetsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Otani </PERSON>, 25, as saying at the airport. However, he said the passengers remained calm. The agency quoted another passenger, <PERSON> Kazuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, 25, as saying: `` I expected death at any moment.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, who was on her honeymoon, told <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> that as the jet landed, the passengers clapped wildly. `` We are lucky we are alive!'' <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> quoted Ms. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> as telling her husband.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of Soviet emigres applauded <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> when they elected him chairman of a group of fellow former Soviet refuseniks that plans to challenge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s immigration policies `` The recent arrival of a few thousand immigrants showed how bad the immigrant absorption system is,'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said at the meeting Sunday. `` How can we talk about attracting tens of thousands of immigrants to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> when we ca n't even deal with the few thousand who came last year?'' The 40-year-old human rights activist, who spent nine years in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> labor camps, conducted a three-week campaign to unite about 20 groups representing Soviet Jews into an umbrella lobbying forum. About 400 activists at the meeting spoke in Russian and proudly displayed round blue badges designating them as delegates. There are about 200,000 former Soviet Jews in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said he wants to set up a private fund to provide low-interest housing loans for immigrants and create a company that immigrants can go to for help in building low-cost housing. He also proposed an employment agency to help find work for immigrants and clubs to help immigrants adjust to life in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said American Jewish organizations are ready to donate funds directly to the immigrants on condition that they speak with a single voice. His attempt to unite the emigres is not the first in the 19 years of Soviet Jewish emigration. Others have ended in failure, among them an all-Soviet Jewish party that did not gather the necessary votes to win a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> seat. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> has the support of many activists and has succeeded in bypassing political differences by declaring his forum a non-political, non-affiliated group. `` We shall try to speak in one voice about the issues we agree upon without involving political arguments,'' he said. But he dismissed the notion that his movement may become a political party. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> played a similar role among Soviet Jews refused permission to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the 1970s. The best known Soviet dissident after <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, he was arrested in 1977, convicted of being a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy and sentenced to 13 years in Soviet prisons. He and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> denied he was a spy. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was released in February 1986 and came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to meet his wife <PERSON> Avital </PERSON>, who left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a day after they were married in 1974. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was seen as a prize for political parties, but he has called <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> politics `` nightmarish.'' `` For a long time I was very cautious about getting involved,'' he said. `` But now it's time to unite.'' Others at the meeting expressed concern about the high number of Soviet Jewish `` dropouts,'' Jews who decided to settle in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or West European countries instead of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Of more than 8,000 Jews permitted to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1987, only 20 percent settled in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In April, 1,088 Jews left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and only 180 came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> reports said.

<HEAD>Gain Biggest Since December</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods climbed 1.6 percent in March, the biggest increase in three months, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. The department said that orders for durable and non-durable goods rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 216.08 billion in March, the best showing since a 2 percent rise in December. The March advance represented surprising strength, especially since the government had reported 10 days ago in a preliminary report that orders for durable goods had remained frozen in March. That was changed today to show a healthy 1 percent increase, reflecting new-found demand in orders for primary metals and machinery and in the transportation sector. The 1.6 percent overall increase followed no change in February and a slight 0.6 percent drop in January. During the first two months of the year, many businesses cut back on orders in an effort to reduce a large buildup of unsold goods. Originally there was concern that the big rise in unsold goods that had occurred in the last three months of 1987 would topple the country into a recession, especially if jittery consumers stopped buying big-ticket items following the Oct. 19 stock market collapse. These fears proved unwarranted, however, as a rebound in consumer spending helped propel the overall economy to healthy growth at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first three months of the year. The 1.6 percent March increase in factory orders was aided in part by a 17.4 percent surge in demand for military equipment, which rose to $ 10.04 billion. Without this big defense buildup, the overall orders increase would have been a smaller 1 percent. The key category of non-defense capital goods fell 3.8 percent to $ 32.5 billion. Despite the setback, analysts are still looking for this sector to show strength this year as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses boost spending on expansion projects to meet rising demand. Orders for transportation equipment climbed 3.4 percent while orders for primary metals such as steel were up 6.1 percent and orders for non-electrical machinery advanced 2.1 percent. Orders for non-durable goods, items not expected to last three years, rose 2.3 percent to $ 100.6 billion. Shipments of manufactured goods increased 2.6 percent to a record high of $ 214.4 billion following a 0.8 percent February increase. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that construction spending rose 1.5 percent in March, the biggest increase since April 1987. The advance was led by a 5.4 percent surge in spending on government building projects, which climbed to an annual rate of $ 82.3 billion, 8.1 percent higher than a year ago.

<HEAD>Court Rules in Case of Rhode Island Newspaper that Published FBI
Information</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today ruled that federal lawyers procedurally botched a contempt-of-court case against a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> newspaper that published <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> information about a Mafia boss. By a 6-2 vote, the justices said the procedural flaw must result in dismissing the government's appeal from a ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> was justified in defying a judge's order barring publication of the material. The newspaper thus had its federal appeals court victory sustained without the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ever reaching the merits of the contempt-of-court case. `` Having concluded that the court-appointed prosecutor who -LRB- appealed -RRB- and briefed and argued the case without the authorization of the solicitor general may not represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before this court, we dismiss -LRB- the appeal -RRB-,'' Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> wrote. The flaw was called to the court's attention by the Journal's lawyers, who requested that the case be tossed out The controversy stems from publication of information the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> obtained about <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L.S </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patriarca </PERSON>, reputed longtime crime boss for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, by tapping his Providence telephone without court approval from 1962 to 1965. The Journal was allowed access to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> logs and memoranda from the recordings in 1985, after <PERSON> Patriarca </PERSON> died. But <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patriarca </PERSON>, son of the reputed crime figure, challenged in court the information's release. He sought to bar publication. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> held hearings on <PERSON> Patriarca </PERSON>'s complaint on Nov. 13, 1985, and ordered the newspaper not to publish anything from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> materials until a Nov. 15 hearing. The Journal on Nov. 14 published an article that included information from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> logs and memoranda. <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> then ruled that the newspaper and its executive editor, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON>, were in contempt. He fined the Journal $ 100,000 and ordered <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON> to perform 200 hours of public service. But the 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturned <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>'s ruling The appeals court said the order barring publication had been `` transparently invalid'' and the newspaper therefore could violate it with impunity. When <PERSON> Patriarca </PERSON> challenged release of the information, <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> had appointed <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> as a `` special prosecutor'' to represent the federal government because the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were defendants in <LOCATION> Patriarca </LOCATION>'s lawsuit. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> also represented the government in the appeals court, and filed the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal that was granted review last October. But <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> never received <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> permission to file that appeal, and the Journal's lawyers said the lack of permission was illegal. Federal law requires the solicitor general, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top-ranking courtroom lawyer, to file virtually all <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeals for the government unless he authorizes someone else to do so. Just why <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> was not authorized by Solicitor General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON> to file the appeal was not explained in briefs submitted to the justices. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported that sources close to the case `` blame the solicitor general's office, which, they say, showed little interest in the case despite efforts by the special prosecutor to maintain contact.'' Writing for the court today, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said, `` Absent a proper representative of the government as a petitioner in this criminal prosecution, jurisdiction is lacking and the -LRB- appeal -RRB- heretofore granted is now dismissed.'' Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> dissented. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not participate in the case, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 87-65.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today complained that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has failed to provide enough money for day-care programs and called on him to endorse legislation to expand federal funding for child care. One day earlier, during a stop in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination said his likely November opponent, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, did nothing to stop the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration from dealing with drug runners instead of fighting the nation's drug problem. Today, at a day-care center in a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> high school, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> read a story to 12 children whose mothers attend the school. `` This is the kind of thing we need,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of the center. `` We need to have it as a matter of national policy.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, wrapping up his <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> campaign with stops in four cities today, also called for stepped-up federal efforts to help collect child support from delinquent fathers. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, looking for big wins Tuesday in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> to cement his position in the race, also said Sunday that community intervention, not capital punishment, is the best way to curb drug trafficking. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met Sunday with law enforcement officials in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, countering <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recent focus on crime and drugs with sharp criticisms of past <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration dealings with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is now under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug charges. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also suggested the administration tolerated drug smugglers who were used to help resupply the administration-backed Nicaraguan Contra rebels. `` What kind of message is that for the courageous police officers, school superintendents, teachers, educators and parents and the children of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. `` This is an administration that ca n't say no to drug dealers itself. How can it tell our kids to do that?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. `` The greatest threat to our security in this hemisphere is not the Sandinistas, it's the avalanche of drugs that is flowing into this country.'' While he frequently attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made no direct references to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, his sole remaining active Democratic rival. But he urged supporters to ignore a new poll showing him with an overwhelming lead in the race for <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s 159 Democratic delegates. `` My friends, pollsters do n't vote, people do,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used the backdrop of a county jail in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> and confiscated drugs and weapons at a police station in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> to underscore his attacks on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration drug policy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee, has called on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to support the death penalty for major drug suppliers. `` It's been tried,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a staunch opponent of capital punishment. `` It does n't work.'' Instead, he called for greater cooperation between federal, state and local law enforcement and education officials and increased federal funding for drug programs. Such efforts, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, have been `` jerked around'' during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years because of funding cuts. `` If we're going to solve the problem, it's got to be at the community level,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said from the steps of the county jail in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. From there he went on to <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Packo </PERSON>'s, a restaurant often referred to by the fictional character <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> in the television series `` M.A.S.H.'' There, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lashed out at Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a favorite target in his effort to tie <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to a long list of allegedly improper activity in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` I want to be a president who will appoint an attorney general you and I can be proud of and who will put justice back in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Earlier Sunday, in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he could not describe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role as vice president because he had not distinguished himself on any issue. `` I'm not sure I can answer what that role has been, frankly, because he's such a blank slate,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. While in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> participated in a May Day parade in a Polish neighborhood. The poll of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> residents released Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a nearly 3-1 lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ 62 percent to 22 percent _ with 16 percent undecided and a 3.5 percentage point margin of error. The poll was conducted over 10 days beginning April 20.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Connecticut Police Search KKK Rally Attenders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to let <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> police conduct pat-down searches for weapons on all people who attend <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan rallies. The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that such searches violated individuals' privacy rights. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, imperial wizard of the Invisible Empire, and fellow <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrands </PERSON> sued <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> law enforcement authorities to challenge pat-down searches conducted at <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> rallies throughout the state from 1980 through 1984. The first <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> rally in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> in some 50 years was held in the rural town of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> eight years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> learned that groups with a history of violent confrontations with the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> planned several counter-demonstrations in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Police obtained a court injunction allowing them to set up checkpoints and subject people headed to the rally site to pat-down searches. The searches yielded seven guns, ammunition, 41 knives, two swords, two machetes, five baseball bats, three pieces of pipe, eight lengths of chain, two cans of mace, weighted knuckles and a number of clubs. Such pat-down searches were conducted at most of the 16 <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> rallies subsequently held in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> communities, and yielded similar weapons. At each, all people seeking to pass established checkpoints near the rally sites were advised of their right to turn back and avoid being frisked. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabranes </PERSON> ruled that the ban on unreasonable police seaches contained in the Constitution's Fourth Amendment was being violated by such pat-down searches. Citing a 1967 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on police pat-down searches, <PERSON> Cabranes </PERSON> said such tactics are lawful only when officers have a reasonable belief that a particular person poses a threat to public safety. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> essentially upheld the judge's ruling last Nov. 9. `` The mass pat-down searches conducted at these Klan rallies went beyond the bounds established by the Fourth Amendment,'' the appeals court ruled. But the 2nd Circuit court modified <PERSON> Cabranes </PERSON>' ruling to allow police to search people and packages at such rallies with magnetometers, devices that detect metal objects. State authorities then sought <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review, noting that magnetometer searches do not detect non-metallic weapons such as clubs and bats. Their appeal likened the pat-down searches to the growing number of public places, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s building, that use metal detectors. `` We enter courthouses and other governmental buildings today expecting to pass through some sort of security system ... Similar measures are employed with respect to air travel, public appearances of high government officials or candidates for high office, military installations, diplomatic facilities and legislative chambers,'' the appeal said. `` We have seen too much ideologically related violence in our time to ignore the threat it poses,'' the state authorities added. `` Niavete would be too costly.'' The case is <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, 87-1363.

<HEAD>Court Refsues to Let States Tax Some Pension Fund Income in
Vermont Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to let states tax pension fund income from investments in federal government securities. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> officials who said they should be allowed to tax the income after it is distributed to retirees. The <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last December upheld a ruling by a state judge who said the pension fund money is tax-exempt. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Mathhew </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> ruled that interest on federal obligations _ such as short-term government borrowing _ is immune from state taxation even when the income is passed on by a pension fund to a retired investor. `` In practical operation, the tax in question was in fact a state tax on interest derived from federal obligations,'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said. The fact that pension money was passed on to someone other than the fund itself does not eliminate the exemption enjoyed by investments in federal securities, he said. The judge rejected arguments by state officials that interest on a government security is exempt `` only in the hands of the original recipient unless there is a specific federal statute to pass through the tax-exempt character of such income.'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> ruled in favor of <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keys </PERSON>, who when he retired in 1981 received a lump-sum distribution of $ 141,000 from a savings plan in which he had invested. The money included $ 35,000 in interest on federal securities. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> officials said Keys owed an additional tax of $ 1,246 on the income from the government obligations. The court rulings in Keys' favor meant he received a tax refund of $ 203 plus interest. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> officials said a lot more was at stake. They said the state court rulings could force them to examine the source of payments from pension and mutual funds, corporate dividends and even bank deposit interest and then eliminate from the state's tax base any income traced to investments in federal obligations. The case is <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> vs. Keys, 87-1583.

 Defense attorneys for accused Colombian drug lord <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> said today they will rest their case without calling any witnesses. The surprise announcement came on the defense's opening day after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> denied defense attorneys' motion for a 60-day delay to allow them time to pore over thousands of documents introduced during the 22-week trial <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, allegedly one of the leaders of the violent <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, is accused of smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from his private island of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>, said today the defense intended only to put some additional documents on the record. `` After moving exhibits in evidence, defendant <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> intends to rest his case this morning,'' <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>'s move came as a surprise. As late as last week, he had estimated the defense would take two weeks. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said he could not comment on the decision itself, but added, `` you could honestly say I looked surprised and stunned.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinbaum </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, said outside the courtrooom he also expects to rest his case immediately. However, <PERSON> Weinbaum </PERSON> said he doubted either side would have closing arguments ready before the end of the week. Following <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>'s announcement, <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> called an hourlong recess to discuss the defense documents. Much of the testimony in the <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> trial has come from convicted drug smugglers granted immunity from prosecution, from others hoping to lessen their sentences and from some who are awaiting sentencing. `` <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> pursued a singular dream, a singular vision: to be the king of cocaine transportation,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said in his opening statement in <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial in mid-November. `` He was to cocaine transportation what <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> was to cars.'' Bahamian officials have also been mentioned during the trial, with numerous witnesses alleging that Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> filled his pockets with bribes from smugglers such as <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>. Although no violence has been directly attributed to <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in the six-month trial, many witnesses have testified about threats communicated by <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> and his workers. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is also charged in separate indictments in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment accuses him of being one of the leaders of the so-called <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, believed to be responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ a bonanza worth $ 8 billion each year.

 A storm packing powerful wind dumped heavy snow on Western mountains today, leaving more than a foot of snow in some areas, after closing entrances to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> and kicking up dust storms blamed for two traffic deaths. The storm also contributed to weekend wind in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that left one boater dead and another missing and believed drowned. It was easing eastward onto the Plains but <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, first struck by the storm on Saturday, was expected to continue feeling its effects well into Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> predicted up to a foot of snow today in higher elevations of eastern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and northern and central <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> of western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> were expected to get up to 6 inches. The 7 a.m. temperature in northwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> was just 10 degrees in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The weather service warned fruit growers along <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wasatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> that a hard freeze was possible today and tonight. The storm left up to 14 inches of snow in the mountains and foothills of south-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Eight inches of snow fell in northwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, closing <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s eastern and southern entrances Sunday. South of the park, 5 inches of snow was reported in <LOCATION> Moose </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, where downed power lines caused blackouts. Heavy rain fell in advance of the snow, with 2.25 inches in 24 hours at <LOCATION> Alliance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, and 1.86 inches at <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, the weather service reported. Interstate 80 in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> was closed today in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION> west to <LOCATION> Walcott </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> and road conditions continued to deteriorate as snowfall increased over the state's southern section, police said. Wind gusting to 40 mph created blizzard conditions around <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, parts of which had no power this morning. Schools in <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> were closed and workers in federal offices there were told to follow their department's bad weather plan. State government workers living in rural areas were told their pay would not be docked if they chose not to drive into <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. Snow also was widespread over eastern sections of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Parts of eastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> got 5 inches of snow overnight. Up to 8 inches was reported at <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, with 7 inches at the Snowbird ski resort east of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and 5 inches at <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION>. `` The trees are loaded -LRB- with snow -RRB- and it's the kind of scene ski films look for. In fact, one's coming in so they timed it just right,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Elwood </PERSON> of Snowbird. `` There's quite a few powder hounds, diehards out there,'' <PERSON> Elwood </PERSON> said. `` That's what they love and that's what they're skiing. In eastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the storm unleashed 50 mph wind and caused a dust storm. Visibility dropped to zero and two pileups occurred on Interstate 70, killing two people and injuring 17, officials said. `` Visibility was down to zero,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> Trooper <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>. `` Dust was blowing so it covered everything like a film of oil. You could n't see in front of your face.'' About 76 miles of I-70 between <LOCATION> Limon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> were closed for more than two hours until visibility improved. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, trucks and trailers with high profiles were banned from Interstate 80 at <LOCATION> Wendover </LOCATION> because of the strong wind. Snow and wind closed Interstate 15 north of Point of the <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for several hours.

 Workers went on strike today at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, birthplace of the Solidarity independent trade movement, government and opposition spokesmen said. Government spokesman <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Augustynowicz </PERSON> said he did not know how many shipyard workers were taking part in the strike. It followed an appeal by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Sunday for a `` day of action'' to support striking steelworkers in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. A banner at the shipyard gate said `` Sit-In Strike,'' said <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwiazda </PERSON>, a local Solidarity leader in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, speaking by telephone. He said the strike began between 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. The strike was proclaimed in all departments of the shipyard and at least 3,000 people were participating, according to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate who is employed as an electrician at the plant. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s remarks were reported by <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, a senior Solidarity adviser in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Also today workers at an electronics factory in southwest <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> ended a one-day work stoppage after they obtained a promise for a $ 15 a month pay increase and possible further increases later in the year, opposition spokesmen said. The work stoppage at the Dolmel electronics plant in Wroclaw involved about about half of the plant's 3,500 workers, said opposition and government spokesmen. At a rally held at 2 p.m., workers were told that management promised the raise after two hours' negotiations, said <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON>, a Wroclaw Solidarity leader at the plant. The workers then decided to return to work Tuesday, he said. In <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, authorities locked the gates to the medieval <ORGANIZATION> Jagiellonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after students scheduled a rally there in support of the striking steelworkers. Despite heavy police presence, dozens of students gathered briefly at two locations in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> with banners and leaflets, said <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Surdy </PERSON>, a spokesman for the strike. Police detained 10 people, he said. Sunday, thousands of people heeded Solidarity's call for a national day of protest and scores of demonstrators were arrested in clashes with police in at least 19 cities. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said 90 people were detained during the May Day protests. Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON> said authorities detained at least 200 people. There were scattered reports of injuries but figures were not available. Meanwhile, steelworkers striking for a seventh day near <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> awaited an answer to a request for negotiations with the deputy prime minister in charge of the economy. A secretary to Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Zdzislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadowski </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic and planning chief had not received a letter sent Sunday by striking steelworkers. The letter invited <PERSON> Sadowski </PERSON> to negotiate with them at the Lenin steelworks in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>. A strike committee at the plant says it represents 16,000 of the plant's 32,000 employees and is demanding recognition of their union rights and a 50 percent raise on the average salary of $ 105 a month. Management said that fewer than 1,000 strikers were at the Nowa Huta plant Sunday. In Polish strikes, workers come to the plant during their scheduled shifts but do no work. Urban said at least 12,000 people took part in illegal demonstrations Sunday. Reports from witnesses and opposition spokesmen put the number at more than 30,000. The demonstrations followed a week of strikes and the worst labor unrest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since the communist government suspended Solidarity in December 1981. It later outlawed the trade federation. Solidarity had called for the demonstrations to protest a lack of union freedom and the government's austerity policy which has caused prices to rise by 42 percent recently. <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON>, the Solidarity spokesman who kept track of arrests, complained of `` exceptional brutality'' by police in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>. He said 84 demonstrators were detained there and claimed that that even passive protesters were repeatedly beaten. In <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told 6,000 supporters they must support strikers at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> steel mill. `` I demand from you solidarity with <PERSON> Nowa </PERSON> <PERSON> Huta </PERSON> tomorrow, in your shipyards, in your ports and in your factories. I want it to be effective. Show me tomorrow what you can do,'' he declared. After the rally, police with clubs attacked 500 militants who tried to march through <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. During the 40-minute melee, protesters hurled rocks and police beat demonstrators. At least four people were seen bleeding. Dozens were herded into police vans. The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said more than 9 million people attended official May Day ceremonies nationwide.

<HEAD>Court Orders Further Hearings on New Jersey Man Accused of Helping

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today ordered further lower court hearings to determine whether a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> man accused of helping Nazis kill more than 2,000 Jews in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> should be stripped of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. By a 6-2 ruling, the court set aside a lower court ruling that revoked the citizenship of 71-year-old <PERSON> Juozas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kungys </PERSON>, a retired dental technician from <LOCATION> Clifton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The decision means at least a temporary postponement in the government's likely effort to deport <PERSON> Kungys </PERSON>. The justices also provided some guidelines for determining when the government may strip the citizenship of those accused of lying to gain entry to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to win citizenship. Revoking citizenship _ a process called denaturalization _ is a preliminary step leading to deportation. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, in his opinion for the court, said citizens generally may be denaturalized if their alleged misstatements or concealments of facts `` had a natural tendency'' to influence decisions by immigration officials. Moreover, <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said another provision of immigration law permits denaturalization if the misstatements demonstrate lack of good moral character. The court ordered the 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider <PERSON> Kungys </PERSON>' case in light of the standards the justices outlined today. The 3rd Circuit court stripped <PERSON> Kungys </PERSON> of his citizenship in 1986, clearing the way for his likely deportation. <PERSON> Kungys </PERSON> has lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1948 and became a citizen in 1954. The government said he lived in <LOCATION> Kedainiai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, in 1941 when <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Nazi forces invaded that area, and that he aided in atrocities against Lithuanian Jews. Government lawyers said <PERSON> Kungys </PERSON>, as a member of a miltiary organization known as <LOCATION> Sauliai </LOCATION>, helped force more than 2,000 Jewish men, women and children to undress and walk into ditches, where they were shot. The 3rd Circuit court had ruled that <PERSON> Kungys </PERSON> made `` material misrepresentations'' when applying for entry into this country and when applying for citizenship. <PERSON> Kungys </PERSON>' lawyers said the alleged lies _ mispresentations about his age and place of birth _ were not significant enough to cost him his citizenship. Government officials said <PERSON> Kungys </PERSON> also lied about where he lived during World War II in an effort to conceal his true identity. Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said in a dissenting opinion that they would uphold the 3rd Circuit court ruling stripping <PERSON> Kungys </PERSON> of his citizenship. The case is <PERSON> Kungys </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 86-228.

 <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s 1st Congressional District seat was a hotbed of scandal and tragedy for Democrats and Republicans before the apparent suicide of the top aide to Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, the incumbent.

After a series of legal challenges, he went to prison in 1970. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s successor, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C.B </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, who later became Republican national chairman, represented the sprawling <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> district for five terms before resigning to accept an appointment as President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s secretary of the interior. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, a Republican elected in a special 1971 election to fill the vacancy, shot himself to death in 1973 amid news accounts that he failed to report a $ 25,000 campaign contribution from the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Reelect the President, an undisclosed fund of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s re-election finance committee. Newspaper reports at the time said <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> made an unusual personal appeal to then-Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> for money to help finance the congressional campaign of <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>'s close friend <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>.

But he was defeated in 1980 by <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> after being implicated in a sex scandal. A charge that <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> solicited sex from a 16-year-old male prostitute was dropped after <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> agreed to be counseled for alchoholism. He later acknowledged his homosexuality, publishing an autobiography in 1986 that detailed his marriage, homosexual life and drinking problem. His marriage was annulled in 1982.

 A sightseeing helicopter that crashed into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, killing a Japanese businessman and injuring the four other people aboard, fell out of the sky `` like a stone,'' a survivor says. The Bell 206-B Jet Ranger plunged 1,400 feet into the river Sunday minutes before it was to land. It quickly sank to a depth of 35 feet in the 40-degree water. The 22-year-old pilot had been trying to make an emergency landing and had radioed that the helicopter was experiencing `` performance difficulties,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempster </PERSON>, whose company owns the aircraft <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghiorsi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, said the aircraft was taken to Island Helicopter's <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> base for a mechanical investigation. Passenger <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelikan </PERSON> said he heard a `` loud, whistling noise,'' then the helicopter fell `` like a stone into the water.'' The pilot had activated emergency flotation pontoons, but they apparently separated from the craft on impact, <PERSON> Dempster </PERSON> said. The cabin darkened and filled with water, <PERSON> Pelikan </PERSON> said. `` I could n't open the seat belt,'' the 55-year-old West German businessman said. `` After about 45 seconds, I slipped out of the safety belt and found a hole in the door, perhaps it was a window. I do not know. I could not see.'' <PERSON> Pelikan </PERSON>, the pilot and two other passengers who made their way to surface were pulled out of the water by police. They were not seriously hurt. A police scuba diver found the fourth passenger strapped into a rear seat in the helicopter 1 -LCB- hours later, and cut him loose. The passenger, identified by the Japanese Consulate as <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Oyama </PERSON>, was taken to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he died, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schectman </PERSON>, a hospital administrator. <PERSON> Oyama </PERSON> worked for <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the consulate said.

 Astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, an outspoken critic of Marxism in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, published or edited five scientific works last year, an authoritative weekly said today in a lengthy article chronicling <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>'s academic achievements. `` Writing and editing five books in one year is my record,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> as saying. `` It may be the result of my concentrated effort.'' One of the books, `` Creation of Cosmology,'' was co-published with his wife <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, a physics teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where the couple live. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, 52, was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and fired from his job as vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> province in January 1987 after being accused of inciting students to stage pro-democracy demonstrations. The official media, however, has stressed in several pieces on <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> that he enjoys academic freedom at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Observatory </LOCATION>, where he has been working since last year. Since losing his university job `` for outspokenly advocating bourgeois liberalist views,'' the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Review said, `` <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> has achieved a great deal in his research work.'' The article said <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> was allowed to visit <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for the 12th time last summer for academic activities, during which he reached an agreement with the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to jointly build an international exchange center for astrophysics in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. While in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, friends urged him to stay abroad, but <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> refused, saying that as a scientist he had a social responsibility, the weekly said. It did not mention an interview <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> gave to the West German magazine <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> while in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in which he said that `` Marxism is a thing of the past'' and that `` democracy that comes from above is no democracy, it is nothing but a relaxation of control.'' The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Review quoted <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> as saying that last year's student demonstrations and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities' ensuing campaign against bourgeois liberalization, or Western ideas, at least made people think `` I have n't done an all-round, deep study of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s politics and economy. I just speak my own mind,'' he said. He said the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people have high hopes in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> following a major party congress last fall in which leaders committed the party to long-range political and economic reforms.

 A witness said a stuck throttle may have caused a race car to spin out of control, killing one person and injuring five at the state fairgrounds. `` There was general chaos, a lot of dust, screaming and running,'' <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, who was taking pictures at the event, said Sunday. `` The driver walked away from the accident in tears.'' State Police Trooper <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Capitano </PERSON> said the car, equipped with large wheels, hit spectators who were watching the `` mud bog'' event of the General Tire 4-Wheel and Off-Road Jamboree Spring Nationals. `` The vehicle going through the mud bog lost control and went through a fence that was 350 feet from the end of the bog, and hit spectators who were 95 feet back of the fence,'' <PERSON> Capitano </PERSON> said. `` He just could n't stop. We do n't know if something mechanical broke or what. We're investigating,'' he said. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said that when the car got out of the mud bog it made a loud noise as though the throttle was stuck. The car crashed sideways through a wire and wood fence that was erected for crowd control, then `` rocketed'' toward a group of 30 to 50 spectators at a high rate of speed, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. The mud bog is a heavily watered route, 200 feet long, that includes steep hills. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huntley </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION>, died of massive multiple injuries, said <LOCATION> Sangamon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Huntley </PERSON> was apparently run over by the car, <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luber </PERSON>, 9, of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> was in critical condition today at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Gron </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Hobart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, was in serious condition, and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gand </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> was in fair condition, Ms. <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeli </PERSON>, 15, of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, was treated and released.

<HEAD>Efficiency Gain Nearly Reverses Previous Quarter's Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The efficiency of the nation's businesses in churning out goods and services improved at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the first quarter of 1988, nearly reversing a deterioration of 1 percent in the last three months of 1987, the government said today. Despite an increase of nearly a million new jobs from January through March, non-farm businesses raised the total number of hours worked by only 1.7 percent while achieving a 2.7 percent increase in output. And for the first time since late 1986, workers overall are keeping up with inflation, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Wages and benefits increased at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the first quarter, raising the labor costs associated with each service or product by 2.4 percent. Those labor costs had skyrocketed at an annual rate of 4.5 percent in the final quarter of 1987 on a massive employment surge. However, after taking inflation into account _ as measured by relative changes in total output and prices _ the wage gains yielded not a penny more of purchasing power. The 0.9 percent improvement in productivity for non-farm businesses, which are responsible for about three-fourths of the nation's economic activity, is only slightly ahead of the 0.8 percent increase for all of 1987. Earlier figures had shown a 0.3 percent increase in the fourth quarter of last year, but those were revised in today's report to a 1 percent deterioration. Manufacturing, which still accounts for about one-fourth of the country's gross national product, continued to lead the effort in restoring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness. Manufacturers' productivity increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the first quarter with a 4.3 percent increase in output on only a 1.3 percent increase in the number of hours worked in the nation's factories. For the first time since early 1986, factory workers actually kept ahead of inflation. Nominal wage gains averaging 3.9 percent annually in the first quarter _ the biggest jump in about three years _ increased the purchasing power of manufacturing employees by one-half of 1 percent after dropping 2.2 percent in 1987. It also raised the labor costs associated with each item coming off the assembly lines by 1 percent, compared with a nearly 2 percent drop in labor costs in 1987.

<TEXT>
 Four senators who hold sway over <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spending say they will not authorize a $ 700 million scheme to lease an unmanned robot space factory from the private developers who would build and own it. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the senators said that neither the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration nor <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has done the studies to justify such an expenditure. They directed the space agency to contract with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> to `` undertake a thorough and independent review'' to be completed by next March. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed that the government agree in advance to lease 70 percent of the so-called Commercially Developed Space Facility at $ 140 million a year for five years. The private facility would be carried into orbit by the space shuttle and revisited periodically by astronauts who would service the factory and bring back its products. `` The committee feels that a $ 700 million budget commitment, especially in these times of severe budget constraints, should be based on a detailed assessment of the nation's microgravity research requirements and capabilities,'' the senators told <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>.

 Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a `` blank slate'' and urged him to speak out on breaches of law and ethics in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> talked today of `` a historical dimension'' of his campaign after spending the night at a union organizer's home. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in comments today in the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Berea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said he'd stayed at the modest home of steelworker union organizer <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulimeni </PERSON> to bring attention to laborers who he said have been hurt by administration economic policies. `` There simply are two dimensions to this campaign,'' he said. Besides the race for the presidential nomination, there is `` a historical dimension. It is part of the thrust to open up the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political system ... the thrust to empower locked-out people.'' One day earlier, as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was criticizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made fun of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying: `` The kitchen is clean and cool _ ai n't nothin' cooking. The two Democratic rivals and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the guaranteed <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee, were campaigning today in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on the eve of the state's primary The District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> have primaries the same day, but <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> offers the biggest delegate prize. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, at a day care center in a high school today, complained that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has failed to provide enough money for day-care programs and called on him to endorse legislation to expand federal funding for child care. `` This is the kind of thing we need,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> high school center. `` We need to have it as a matter of national policy.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who preached a pair of Sunday sermons in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, vowed to `` turn up the heat'' on rival <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. And he brushed aside surveys suggesting the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor holds a nearly 3-1 lead in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where 159 Democratic delegates are at stake Tuesday. A poll conducted Friday and Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a 65 percent to 23 percent lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> among Democrats most likely to participate in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> primary _ results similar to two other polls. All had potential margins of sampling error of about plus or minus 3 percentage points. A poll published Sunday in the <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> suggested <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had the support of 62 percent of registered Democrats, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 22 percent and 16 percent were undecided or supported other candidates. Another survey, for the <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, had similar results _ 64 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 24 percent, with 14 percent for others. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also picked up the support of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper. The current <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate count puts <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at 1,277 and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 852. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> professed optimism. `` Our campaign of hope continues,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told backers. `` Our support base gets broader and bigger every day.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was airing ads in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> portraying himself as a candidate of change, in contrast to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He implied that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' cautious style amounted to a lack of leadership. `` The kitchen is clean and cool,'' he said. `` Ai n't nothin' cooking. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent Sunday sounding law-and-order themes, visiting a police station in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> and stopping at <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>'s county jail. And he hammered away at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, saying that under it, `` rule of law and respect for the Constitution have not been the order of the day.'' In calling for tougher anti-drug efforts, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited the administration's history of dealings with Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` How can we tell our kids to say no to drugs when we have an administration that ca n't say no to drugs and drug dealers?'' he said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also suggested the administration could not effectively fight drugs with its top law enforcement official _ Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> _ embroiled in his own legal problems. The attorney general is the subject of a nearly yearlong criminal investigation. `` It's got to begin at the top, with a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> that knows what justice and rule of law is all about,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>. `` We've got an attorney general that should have left the office a long time ago _ and you know that and I know that.'' Later, in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ought to air his views more fully on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policymaking and on controversial matters like <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal problems. `` I'm not sure I can answer what that role has been, frankly, because he's such a blank slate. One does n't know. I hope we'll learn as time goes on,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not being `` sufficiently outraged'' to get involved in the Meese matter. `` There comes a time when personal cronyism ... must be replaced by a loyalty to public honor,'' he said in an address at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last week that if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were found innocent of the allegations against him, he would `` certainly'' hire him. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now has 1,163 delegates, according to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> tally _ more than the 1,139 delegates needed to nominate. Former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is still technically a candidate but has just 42 delegates.

 State Assemblyman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> confronted some South Vietnamese protesters outside his home with a baseball bat, police said. However, a spokesman for <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said the politician was carrying a bat because he was on his way to coach a Little League baseball game. No injuries were reported and no arrests were made Saturday outside the home <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> shares with his wife, actress <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hard </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, a two-time Oscar winner, is in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> filming the movie `` Old Gringo,'' with <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smits </PERSON>. About 25 people, most of them South Vietnamese, participated in the protest, carrying signs and calling <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> a traitor and liar, <PERSON> Hard </PERSON> said. `` Some of them activated the intercom at his front gate and began chanting into it,'' <PERSON> Hard </PERSON> said. `` It created a confrontation between the demonstrators and <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, who was carrying a baseball bat.'' `` He came out swearing at the Vietnamese,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Zirgulis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the protest. `` We were completely stunned and taken aback that this politician would go berserk. He actually went berserk,'' <PERSON> Zirgulis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, a baseball enthusiast, was on his way to coach a <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> game when he met the demonstrators on the sidewalk outside his home, his spokesman, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, said Sunday. `` He said he ` chewed them out like -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coach </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasorda </PERSON> would have had they been banging on his gate,''' <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>'s opponent in the June 7 primary, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Cota </PERSON>, was also at the demonstration, which <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Cota </PERSON> of staging. Both are Democrats. On Sunday, <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> also termed the protest political shenanigans. `` That is totally false,'' <PERSON> Cota </PERSON> responded Sunday. `` I did not organize the demonstration at all. I came only as an observer after I heard about the demonstration.'' The protest was staged to coincide with the 13th anniversary of the fall of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to the communists, <PERSON> Zirgulis </PERSON> said. But the group also wanted <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> to apologize for past remarks they feel were insulting to the Vietnamese, he added. Those remarks were made by <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> in June 1987 about a U.S.-based Vietnamese gang whom he described as a `` bully element'' involved in shootings, extortion and efforts to raise money to overthrow the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> government. The Santa <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON>, who is seeking his fifth term in the state Assembly, has often been a target of protests over his anti-war activities, as has Miss <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> was one of the so-called `` Chicago 7'' who were convicted for their role in protests during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The convictions later were overturned. He was elected to the state legislature in 1982.

 About 400 leftists rampaged through a working class section of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, smashing windows, erecting barricades and pelting police with rocks, officials said Monday. Police said 134 people were arrested and 53 police officers injured in the violence in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kreuzberg </LOCATION> district. But the city policemen's union said that 87 officers had been injured. City officials said the violence late Sunday and early Monday was a sign of what officials could expect in September, when finance chiefs gather in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> meeting. `` This was just a trial run for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> meeting,'' city interior affairs chief <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Kewenig </PERSON> said. Some stores were looted after the windows were smashed, a police statement said. Police said one group of hooded men broke into an apartment and roughed up a 21-year-old man who had been photographing the melee. The vandalism started after an estimated 8,000 people marched in a May Day parade in the working class neighborhood of <LOCATION> Kreuzberg </LOCATION>. Young leftists in the <LOCATION> Kreuzberg </LOCATION> district, an area of high unemployment, stage protests nearly every year on May Day. Demonstrations are anticipated during the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> meeting here.

<HEAD>Vietnam Asks For Aid As It Heads Into Another Year of Bad Harvests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is asking for urgent assistance from the West because its staple crop, rice, is being ravaged by bad weather, disease and insects. Top Vietnamese government officials told representatives of foreign embassies and relief agencies on April 14 that these same problems had caused a shortfall of more than 1.6 million tons of foodgrain last year. According to a Western diplomat who attended the meeting in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, the Vietnamese said there was a risk of famine in some provinces and that some villages in the northern part of the country had n't had rice for weeks. Two days before the meeting, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s official domestic radio said the first crop of 1988 was developing poorly because of lack of sunlight in the first three months. Twenty percent of the cultivated area can be rated poor, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanoi </ORGANIZATION> said in a broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The broadcast said nearly 74,130 acres were affected by insects and diseases and 247,000 acres by root suffocation disease. Another 321,100 acres lacked sufficient water, and the water level of ponds, lakes and reservoirs has dropped 6.5 to 19.5 feet compared with previous years, it said. Storms and typhoons also are expected to take their annual heavy toll on crops after the rainy season arrives in a few months. Communist-ruled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest nations, annually suffers from a combination of stagnant food production and high population growth. The new pragmatic leadership has stressed reforms based on material incentives to try to boost agricultural production. Western relief officials interviewed last year said there were no signs of starvation on any significant scale among the country's 63 million people, but that there was widespread and serious malnutrition, especially among children In the April 14 meeting, the Vietnamese asked for insecticide and fertilizer which the Western diplomat estimated would cost $ 100 million. He said he doubted the international community would provide the full amount. On April 26, <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas fighting Vietnamese troops occupying <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> said the West should exploit <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s food plight by increasing pressure for a Vietnamese pullout. `` If aid is given ... it would be like a transfusion of fresh blood into the body of a blood-starved <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> writhing in its death throes, thus reviving it and enabling it to carry on its war of aggression in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' a guerrilla radio broadcast said. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest of three anti-Vietnamese guerrilla groups, massacred millions of people when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 until 1978, when the Vietnamese invaded.

<HEAD>BIA Seeking Advice from Indian Parents on Upgrading Schools</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, concerned about the weak education its schools are delivering, is asking Indians how it should strengthen the instruction of their children. A new report from the bureau documenting test scores worse than those of 79 percent of the nation's students calls on tribal school boards, councils and others to consider an improvement strategy emphasizing strong principals held accountable for results. Of the bureau districts, what it calls `` agencies,'' only one showed children scoring above the national median for their grade. Tribal leaders and school boards have had access to their own scores before. But the new report commissioned by <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Swimmer </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary for Indian affairs, provides the first opportunity for one tribe or area to compare its standing with another, said an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who discussed the document on condition of anonymity. The authors conceded that it will be difficult to install new leaders and revitalizing a system that appears too often to be going through the motions. Calling the system `` in dire need of improvment,'' the report said: `` It is no secret that <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> education is today an organization lacking in a sense of direction.'' `` Its most productive members often feel that any successes they achieve occur despite the system, rather than with its support. `` Collegiality, the act of putting aside vested interests and working for the good of the whole, is found in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best educational institutions but is often missing in the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> system, where administrators are sometimes more interested in shoring up and expanding their administrative domain.'' Drawing on research findings being promoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, the report said: `` It is the principal above all who needs to insist on high standards of achievement for students and teachers and to communicate the firm expectation that these standards will be met. Some <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> teachers seem to begin with the expectation that their students will do poorly.'' The bureau educates 37,917 Indian students, about 10 percent of the nation's young Indians and about as many pupils as the public schools of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. About 30 percent attend boarding schools and about 30 percent are in schools run by tribes under contract with the bureau. Few of the students even approached national averages on standard tests administered in the 1985-1986 school year. The highest scores appeared in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Northern Pueblo agency, where 27 second-graders averaged in the 52nd percentile. This means they did better than 52 percent of all students taking the test. The <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> agency, also in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, showed an average in the 46th percentile for its 63 second-graders, and schools not affiliated with an agency in the eastern states showed 73 sixth-graders in the 49th percentile. The worst scores were recorded in the <LOCATION> Chinle </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, where 202 fourth-graders and 154 fifth-graders, mostly from rural <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> families, wound up in the 7th percentile. The report highlights some success stories but says the system needs a systematic way of spreading knowledge of successes to other areas. For instance, the Dilcon and <LOCATION> Chuska </LOCATION> boarding schools for Navajo in the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Defiance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, district use a special curriculum requiring students to write something every day. Their eighth-graders do well, with <PERSON> Dilcon </PERSON>'s two months ahead of the national average and <LOCATION> Chuska </LOCATION>'s a year above the bureau average, though a year behind the nation. Because of the isolation of the schools, administrative demands, pay falling behind the public schools and other reasons, the bureau system has an annual turnover rate of 33 percent per year among principals and 20 percent among all professionals. Among other recommendations, the report calls for consideration of education loans for prospective teachers, with a larger fraction forgiven the longer the teacher stays in the system; for recruiting retired people with valuable knowledge who might like a second career; and for easing the requirement that Indians be given preference as principals.

The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the legitimate president. <PERSON> Wainio </PERSON> said that canal expenses during the rest of 1988 are expected to wipe out any revenue surplus. The treaty specifies that any surplus revenue, up to $ 10 million annually during the life of the treaty, be turned over to the Panamanian government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> paid <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> nearly $ 79 million for use of the canal in fiscal 1987. Payments in fiscal 1988 are expected to total $ 80 million. For now, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is depositing the payments in an escrow account in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The commission employs nearly 8,000 people, including Panamanians and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. <PERSON> Wainio </PERSON> said the employees have shown up for work regularly. The canal has not been affected by violent anti-Noriega demonstrations that have rocked the rest of the country since June. In March, a two-week general strike shut down much of the Panamanian economy, but it had no effect on the canal. `` The Panamanians are not going to take a chance of doing anything that would upset canal operations. They will be taking over in 1999,'' <PERSON> Wainio </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wainio </PERSON> said that during the first five months of fiscal 1988, a total of 5,017 vessels navigated through the canal, compared with a projected figure 5,061. Commodities, especially grain, and containerized cargo, accounted for msot of the increase in cargo

 A top federal health official says he hopes the surgeon general's coming declaration that nicotine is addictive will prompt the public to give cigarette smoking the same attention as heroin and cocaine use. `` When we call this drug an addicting drug, we have to take it more seriously than we currently do,'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smoking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation'' program `` We have to at least give it the serious attention that we do for the illicit drugs such as heroin, cocaine, etc.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the report by Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> will be issued in the next few weeks and will mark the first time a federal official with such a high rank will have declared nicotine addictive. Although not directly under <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> organizational structure, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smoking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> is among several federal agencies working at the direction of the surgeon general in developing material for the annual smoking report. While there was no question <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is familiar with the contents of the report, department officials expressed surprise that he discussed them in advance of the formal release, tentatively scheduled May 16. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> will not discuss the report in advance of its release. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>'s statements appear to be based on <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s upcoming report, `` which, apparently, he has seen. We have not, and do not intend to comment on something we have not seen.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> did not specify what steps should be taken once <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> issues his report, but he questioned the way cigarettes are distributed. `` Why ... do we sell tobacco products in vending machines?'' he asked. `` We do n't allow other addicting drugs to be sold in vending machines. Why do we allow free samples of the product to be sent through the mail? Or to be passed out on public property where kids and others have free access to them?'' In the past, surgeon generals' reports on smoking have triggered both controversy and some strong actions, and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he expected the same to occur this time. `` What we saw with the last surgeon general's report in 1986, which documented the health effects of passive smoking, that passive smoking can cause lung cancer, we saw that that accelerated the trend toward restricting or banning smoking in public places and in the work place,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` We would expect that this upcoming report would lead to serious consideration of what should be the appropriate public policies for this drug.'' Among the changes prompted by the 1986 report is the recently inaugurated ban on smoking on commercial airplane flights that last two hours or less. `` We've been saying for many years now that nicotine is an addicting drug, just like cocaine, just like heroin, and other drugs that people commonly accept as addicting,'' he said. `` But this report, which will be released in a few weeks, looks at the evidence in far greater detail than we've ever looked at before. It compares this drug, nicotine, versus other drugs. `` And we hope that once the public begins to understand that this is more than just a simple habit, we will begin to take this behavior more seriously than we do,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. The lack of federal regulations on cigarettes is due to the historical social acceptability of smoking `` and probably the political influence of the tobacco industry,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. About 27 percent of the adult population smokes cigarettes, compared with 42 percent in 1964 when the first surgeon general's report documenting health risk from smoking was released, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> governing conference today voted strongly to retain its rules forbidding ordination of `` self-avowed, practicing homosexuals.'' After an hourlong, tense debate, delegates voted, 676 to 293, to maintain the restriction, assailed by some as unfair and even unenforceable. Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stumbo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kans. </LOCATION>, a delegate, said the regulation was a `` legal nightmare in terms of provability'' since self-incrimination violates the concept of due process. Another lawyer-delegate, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, argued, however, that the rule was essential and that `` many people owuld leave the church if it is not retained.'' The action came shortly after the delegates also had voted overwhelmingly not to substitute a more liberal section about the ordained ministry. Several other questions related to homosexuality still were before the conference, including a section of the church discipline calling `` the practice of homosexuality ... in compatible with Christian teaching.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodists </ORGANIZATION> have struggled for 18 years with the status of homosexuals in the nation's second-largest Protestant denomination. Delegates the issue the most important before their quadrennial governing conference. An advance poll indicated three-fourths of the 996 delegates oppose any easing of present restrictions. But powerful national agencies of the denomination have urged modifications in disciplines condeming homosexual practice and barring active homosexuals from the clergy. The issue reached a decisive stage on the seventh day of the 11-day conference, which previously has been occupied in committee sessions, with floor action now beginning. The 9.6-million-member denomination, larger than any Protestant body in the country except for <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION>, first established standards against active homosexuality in 1972, following several years of debate. Controversy about the issue has gone on ever since, including at the last three general conferences. `` The sides are too polarized to find any common ground,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. At issue were three sections in the denomination's Book of Discipline, including: A section on social principles terms homosexual persons of `` sacred worth,'' entitled to church participation, care and other human and civil rights, but adds: `` We do not condone the practice of homosexuality and consider this practice incompatible with Christian teaching.'' Another section on the ordained ministry says clergy must uphold `` fidelity in marriage and celibacy in singleness,'' adding: `` Since the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> teaching, self-avowed practicing homosexuals are not to be accepted'' in the ordained ministry. A section on administrative order bars use of any church funds for homosexual groups or `` to promote acceptance of homosexuality.'' Changes to modify or eliminate the various restrictions were sought by three denominational boards, along with a women's commission and youth unit But the church's bishops have urged maintenance of the present standards. Hundreds of petitions on one side or the other have poured in from regional and local church units and individuals. Bishop <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, outgoing president of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, says relaxing rules on homosexuality would lead to an `` angry exodus'' from the church. He adds: `` Any legislation that opens the way for the acceptance of homosexuality as an alternate, normal lifestyle within the Christian community would be impossible for vast numbers of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodists </ORGANIZATION> all over the world to accept.'' Representatives of a homosexual caucus, Affirmation, said they had little hope of any change, but would n't leave the church over it. `` We are not surrendering the church to its most narrow and bigoted elements,'' said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. He told reporters Sunday that `` heterosexism'' was behind discrimination against homosexuals. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Skeete </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> called the church's plan to start a new university in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` one of the most exciting missional opportunities we have faced in years.'' He said the church in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` stands on the threshold of a new and exciting time.'' Delegates voted overwhelmingly Saturday to establish the university in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, with an initial funding of about $ 20 million. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> Methodists have donated a 1,000-acre site for the project. The denomination has 128 colleges and universities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but the African institution will be the first one there. `` An <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> dream'' Bishop <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> called the project, saying the institution's design and leadership would be African.

 Postal executives this week will be introduced to a new breed of postal clerk that may never smile, but which also never frowns or gets cranky or takes a break when there's a line waiting. It's the new face of postal technology _ automated postal clerks _ and they will begin `` greeting'' the American public later this summer. The clerks, Infopost and Autopost, will be on display at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service's <ORGANIZATION> Third </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week. Infopost, which answers customer questions, already is whirring away in test form. It will be deployed to post offices in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area this summer to see how it does in real-life meetings with the public. Autopost, which weighs mail, takes money, makes change and sells postage, is still being built, although a wooden mockup will be on display. Field tests of a working model are expected in the fall. These are but two of the developments that will be under discussion at the three-day international conference, where technical managers will exchange ideas about speeding mail movement. Improved mail-handling technology is critical to speeding up movement of the increasing volume of mail while holding down costs, explained <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, senior assistant postmaster general for management information and research technology. Postal officials say the agency needs automation to avoid being swamped by the 250 billion pieces of mail expected by the year 2000. Other developments described by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> postal officials at a preconference briefing last week included machines that can arrange letters and parcels so the addresses all face the same way, read ZIP codes and handle a variety of other tasks. Teaching machines to read handwriting, for example, is something technicians have struggled with in hopes of developing equipment to find and read ZIP codes and then print a bar code on the letter _ like those black lines used on supermarket items. With the bar code, already widely used by business mailers, letters can be sorted more quickly. Other items under discussion will include laser equipment to help sort mail, automatic truck loading equipment and robots to move mail containers and do other jobs. On hand to see the American work and discuss developments in their own nations will be officials from 16 foreign countries, including <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>. While these executives may long for high-speed mail sorters and cargo handlers, the public face of technology will be embodied in <LOCATION> Infopost </LOCATION> and Autopost. People accustomed to automatic banking machines will likely find the new machinery familiar. Infopost offers information on a television-type screen which the customer touches to enter questions. It can respond either with an answer or with more questions. Asked about rates for overseas mail, for example, the machine can ask the weight of the item, tell what types of things are allowed to be mailed to the country in question, and give the rates and expected delivery time for various mail. It also will print the information on a slip of paper if asked. While Infopost deals with just information, Autopost _ also using an interactive television screen _ is a mailing station. It contains a scale which weighs the item to be mailed and asks for the destination ZIP code. With that information it outlines mailing options _ first class, priority mail, Express Mail or parcel post, for example _ and tells the cost of each option and how long it is expected to take for delivery. The customer can then feed coins, bills or a bank cash card into the machine, and it will make change and issue a postage-meter-like strip to be stuck on the letter or parcel. It will also give a receipt, if asked. The item to be mailed can then be dropped into a mailbox. While Infopost and Autopost are planned for tryouts in lobbies of post offices, eventually they could be extended to shopping malls, supermarkets and other locations, according to postal managers. Each will be connected to a central commuter, which will monitor the supply of postage and change, and call for a technician if problems develop. The computer will sound an alert if someone tries to break into the machines. The machines should be able to handle an estimated 68 percent of post office customer business, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimates, freeing clerks for more complex transactions.

<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON-ON-THE-BRAZOS, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A question of crass versus class has Texans feuding over whether to hoist a flag and pole 13 stories high at the spot where the state's forefathers declared independence from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1836. The 325-foot flagpole would fly a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag one-eighth the size of a football field over a local park. The flagpole, which purportedly would be the world's largest, would be about 245 feet shorter than the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION> Monument near <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, The Dallas Morning News reported. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a banker from nearby <LOCATION> Brenham </LOCATION>, wants to donate the flag and pole. `` Anyone that finds the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag crass and tasteless sure is n't much of a Texan,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said at last week's public hearing on the flagpole proposal Historical purists say the pole and flag would destroy the dignity of `` the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'' and create a carnival atmosphere at the park. `` Somehow the giant pole strikes me as more appropriate for Six Flags or AstroWorld,'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivey </PERSON> said in a reference to theme parks at the spirited hearing. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, a businessman from nearby <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, also said he was opposed to the giant banner and pole. `` You Texans,'' said the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> native, `` certainly do n't need to raise your flag any higher. But some residents of this hamlet of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which surrounds the scenic park that runs to the banks of the <LOCATION> Brazos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, say the flagpole is a banner idea. In the hearing conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushrer </PERSON> said the flagpole would be a boon to the tourist industry and added she was not bothered by claims it would reinforce the image of Texans being `` insufferable braggarts.'' `` Everything about <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is big,'' she said. `` ` Big as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' used to be something we were proud of We had big hats, big cars, big people. We were big in heart and big in pride.'' <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Washington-on-the-Brazos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, argued that because of the state's fiscal situation, the donated flag may not be replaced when it wears out. Parks and Wildlife Department staff will make a recommendation to the agency's nine commissioners, who are expected to deliver a decision May 12. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> refuses to reveal the cost of the pole and flag, but park officials estimated they cost at least $ 100,000. The record tallest flagpole _ 299 feet, 7 inches _ was raised in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> during an international exposition in 1915, according to the `` Guinness Book of World Records.'' If the flag is n't raised at the park, Aggie professor <PERSON> Ivey </PERSON> has another suggestion. `` Place it,'' he said referring to the arch football rival several hundred miles to the north, `` on an island in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texoma </LOCATION> where it would be visible from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION>.''

 Iran-Contra figure <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> today told graduates of the university founded by the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> that criminal charges against him are an honor and part of a legal battle he will win. `` Those accusations are not a brand _ they are an honor,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> told a cheering crowd gathered for his commencement speech at <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` God willing, with your prayers and support, we will prevail, even in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said, a day after his retirement as a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel. North lashed out at congressmen and a special prosecutor who have charged him with diverting money from an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> arms deal to rebels seeking to overthrow <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. `` We must not just choose the right president'' in 1988, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. `` We need a better <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' In introducing <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, an independent Baptist preacher, compared <PERSON> North </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> after noting that journalists had asked him why he chose the indicted <PERSON> North </PERSON> as a commencement speaker. `` We serve a savior who was indicted and convicted and crucified,'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> told some 900 graduating students at the campus of nearly 8,000 that is part of <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s religious empire in this central <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> city. Earlier, a <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> spokesman said the evangelist probably would back North for public office. `` He said last night to a reporter he would probably support him for any state office,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON>, a spokesman for the evangelist, told reporters. Members of a group trying to draft <PERSON> North </PERSON> for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> were among the thousands who showed up at <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to watch <PERSON> North </PERSON> make his first public statements since his indictment in the Iran-Contra affair. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Draft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jamey </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, declined to say whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> supports the effort. `` He has n't been telling us to stop, and that's an encouraging sign,'' <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said. He would not say what the group would do if <PERSON> North </PERSON> did tell them to halt their drive. North, who testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and later was indicted for his role in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's most-publicized scandal, is a fine role model for young people, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said earlier. `` We would n't have him here if we thought he was a bad role model,'' he said. `` By and large, this is a politically conservative school. By and large, we have n't had much opposition.'' The 8,000-student <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in this central <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> city is part of <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s religious empire. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> plans to present North with an honorary doctorate in the humanities. North's speech today comes a day after his retirement as a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel. North is under indictment on charges he conspired to defraud the government by illegally diverting profits from <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> arms sales to Contra rebels seeking to overthrow <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. About 60 people from four area peace activist groups, carrying signs that read `` Ollie Not for President'' and `` Real Heroes Do n't Lie,'' demonstrated in downtown <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION> against <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s appearance at the `` Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> is certainly a national figure,'' <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said. `` He's, in Dr. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s opinion, a great American and somebody who our graduates would remember for a long time as their commencement speaker.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> delivered the commencement address at Liberty last year. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> this spring started a national petition drive seeking a pardon for North. The independent Baptist preacher said he hoped to present 2 million signatures to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> within the next few weeks.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales abroad could jump by $ 3.3 billion, to more than $ 15 billion this year, with much of the increase going to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. But <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the Times report was misleading because a confidential report on which the story was based does not reflect anticipated sales. He said it considers only sales which are `` eligible'' for approval during the calendar year. Since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law requires inclusion of all sales that might be approved, many of which will not take place, `` it would be wrong to characterize the report in any way as a sales plan or to attribute any significance to changes in dollar amounts from one year to another,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The report cited by the Times, sent by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, lists potential sales to 33 countries. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would get $ 3.6 billion worth of arms and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> $ 2.7 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. The request gives more attention to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region than requests of previous years, with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration asking for advanced arms and equipment for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> to counter threats from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. Elsewhere, one of the biggest possible purchasers is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, with a potential $ 3.3 billion in arms, the report said. The president is required to submit an arms sale proposal to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> each year, but the master list has rarely become public. In the last fiscal year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> delivered $ 11.7 billion in military equipment and services to foreign governments and $ 2 billion more was sold directly by manufacturers, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. ANTITRUST LAWS The court said a manufacturer does not always violate federal antitrust law when agreeing with one retailer to stop doing business with another who sells at discount prices. The justices, by a 6-2 vote, said such a `` vertical restraint'' imposed by a manufacturer on a retailer becomes illegal only when `` it includes some agreement on price or price levels.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Sharp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 86-1910. CONTEMPT-OF-COURT The court ruled that federal lawyers procedurally botched a contempt-of-court case against a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> newspaper that published <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> information about a Mafia boss. By a 6-2 vote, the justices said the procedural flaw must result in dismissing the government's appeal from a ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> was justified in defying a judge's order barring publication of the material. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 87-65. TAX INFORMATION The court agreed to hear a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appeal aimed at making it easier for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to turn over tax information to a foreign government. The court said it will review a ruling that limited access by Canadian officials to financial records of two Canadian citizens with bank accounts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 87-1064. KUNGYS The court ordered further lower court hearings to determine whether a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> man accused of helping Nazis kill more than 2,000 Jews in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> should be stripped of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. By a 6-2 ruling, the court set aside a lower court ruling that revoked the citizenship of 71-year-old <PERSON> Juozas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kungys </PERSON>, a retired dental technician from <LOCATION> Clifton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The case is <PERSON> Kungys </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 86-228. <PERSON> KU </PERSON> <PERSON> KLUX </PERSON> KLAN SEARCHES The court refused to let <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> police conduct pat-down searches for weapons on all people who attend <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan rallies. The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that such searches violated individuals' privacy rights. The case is <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, 87-1363. EVIDENCE The court made it easier for federal prosecutors to introduce evidence in criminal trials of prior `` bad acts'' by defendants when the purpose is other than proving bad moral character. By a 9-0 vote, the justices upheld the conviction of a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> man sentenced to a year in prison for possessing stolen videotapes. The case is <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-6. SECURITIES The court refused to let states tax pension fund income from investments in federal government securities. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> officials who said they should be allowed to tax the income after it is distributed to retirees. The case is <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> vs. Keys, 87-1583. FISHING RIGHTS <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to award nearly $ 3 million in attorneys' fees to Indian tribes who won a lengthy court battle against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state officials over fishing rights. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck down the award on grounds a federal law reimbursing lawyers who represent the winning side in civil rights cases does not apply to the Indians' lawsuit. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Makah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribe </ORGANIZATION> vs. State of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 87-1390.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said today a manufacturer does not always violate federal antitrust law when agreeing with one retailer to stop doing business with another who sells at discount prices. The justices, by a 6-2 vote, said such a `` vertical restraint'' imposed by a manufacturer on a retailer becomes illegal only when `` it includes some agreement on price or price levels.'' The decision, a significant one for antitrust law, is a victory for <ORGANIZATION> Sharp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a setback for a former <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> retailer of Sharp calculators. <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owned and operated by <PERSON> Kelton </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrensberger </PERSON>, was the exclusive retailer of Sharp calculators in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> from 1968 to 1972. During that period, <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> became dissatisfied with <ORGANIZATION> BEC </ORGANIZATION>'s performance <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> contended that it was unhappy with <ORGANIZATION> BEC </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to meet sales quotas but a federal jury found that <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> was dissatisfied with <ORGANIZATION> BEC </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of selling calculators at prices lower than those suggested by <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>. Sharp in 1972 appointed <PERSON> Hartwell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> as a second retailer of its calculators in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, and in 1973 terminated <ORGANIZATION> BEC </ORGANIZATION>'s dealership. <PERSON> Hartwell </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> that it o the best possible job at home before expanding coverage elsewhere, he said. <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON>, who took over the family newspaper business when he was 27, has focused on buying newspapers and turning them around by modernizing and streamlining their operations and targeting their markets. `` Lean, capable management is at the heart of all successful companies,'' said <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON>, whose company has a 1988 revenue projection of $ 706 million with an operating cash flow of about $ 180 million. <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> said one of his corporate goals is to take advantage of opportunities in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries and eventually to turn the company into an American-owned international publishing company.

<HEAD>Judge Bans Press In Surrogate Case</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> SANTA </LOCATION> <LOCATION> ROSA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> _ A judge has barred the press from a hearing involving a custody fight between a couple and a surrogate mother, saying the case was essentially a closed-door adoption proceeding. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehden </PERSON> issued his ruling April 25 despite appeals by attorneys representing several <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area news organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Democrat, the <ORGANIZATION> Marin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> KRON </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrass </PERSON> signed a contract in 1985 to bear a child for <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> after being artificially inseminated with sperm provided by the husband. She was paid $ 9,000 when the boy was born in 1986. Barrass, a <LOCATION> Novato </LOCATION> resident, says she had no intention of giving the couple full custody of the child. She wants to be legally recognized as the boy's mother and granted liberal visitation rights. The case is `` more than just a normal adoption matter,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Faux </PERSON>, one of the attorneys who want the hearing opened. `` It's important to have the facts and issues before the public because this is a whole field that has great importance to the public,'' he said. He also said secrecy was not needed because the names of all parties in the case are already known and have been mentioned in earlier news stories.

<HEAD>Five Parties Form Coalition after Long Impasse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> BRUSSELS </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> _ Five parties reached agreement Monday on forming a new government, which would end an impasse that began when the last coalition fell in a language dispute Oct. 19. <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>, prime minister of the last government and now serving as caretaker, also would lead the new coalition. <PERSON> Jean-Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehaene </PERSON>, a Dutch-speaking Christian Democrat who spent more than four months negotiating an accord, said he expected approval at meetings of the five parties Thursday. Involved are the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> - and French-speaking wings of the Socialists and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and the nationalist, Dutch-speaking Volksunie Keeping <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> as head of the 35th Belgian government since World War II `` is the best guarantee for continued stability,'' <PERSON> Dehaene </PERSON> told reporters. He said the coalition should be installed `` within three weeks.'' It will continue the previous center-right administration's economic austerity program, including tax reform and reductions in public spending, he said `` The most immediate problems to which government policies must respond are those of employment and the budget,'' he said. The <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> coalition dissolved Oct. 19 in a linguistic dispute between wings of both his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and conservative coalition parties from <LOCATION> Flanders </LOCATION>, the Dutch-speaking northern half of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wallonia </LOCATION>, where the language is French. In the Dec. 13 elections, the government parties won only 110 of the 212 Parliament seats, a loss of five, and negotiations on forming a new government have continued since. If the five-party coalition comes together it will control 150 seats, well above the two-thirds legislative majority needed for constitutional amendments that would increase regional autonomy in <LOCATION> Flanders </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wallonia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dehaene </PERSON>, social affairs minister in the last government, began negotiations with the five parties Jan. 22 after coalition talks by two Socialist politicians failed. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s population is split between 4.5 million people who speak French and 5.5 million to whom Dutch is native.

 It has <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> scripts, a <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Vee </PERSON> sweater and a replica of the bubble machine that became a trademark of bandleader <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Welk </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fame </ORGANIZATION>, despite years of effort, is still short of the money it needs to display its exhibits to the public. The hall, conceived as a way of recognizing prominent <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> in fields of endeavor ranging from dairy production to sportswriting, resembles nothing so much as the cluttered attic of an eccentric relative. It takes up most of a columned office building north of the state Capitol, but it's not officially open and a visitor is greeted by an expanse of empty floor space. Piles of logs, stacks of bricks and bags of dried leaves rest in one corner. A potbellied iron stove stands near an old-fashioned white porcelain sink. A 1950s-style malt shop booth and five <PERSON> Welk </PERSON> bandstands, painted with the <PERSON> Strasburg </PERSON> native's `` LW'' script, sit incongruously in the center of the main display floor. Most of the Hall of Fame's possessions are locked in eight small rooms, from plaques to books to a mannequin dressed in the uniform of former <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vikings </ORGANIZATION> standout <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>. A life-size cutout of <PERSON> Welk </PERSON>, holding his conductor's baton, stands next to the football player. The white-suited <PERSON> Welk </PERSON> likeness was once stationed on the main floor, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the hall's executive director. But it was moved into a room `` because when I'd come in here, -LRB- if -RRB- it was a bit dark, he'd kind of startle me,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` It is pretty realistic looking.'' Also stashed away are a number of wax dummies, some dressed in Indian garb, that once were the property of the defunct <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Mandan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, a broadcast executive who first thought of the hall of fame idea five years ago, concede its development has been slower than expected. But <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, who has been meeting recently with a number of non-profit groups in an attempt to obtain contributions, said he remained optimistic. `` We're continuing to move ... except it's taking us a little bit longer than we thought,'' <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said. `` At this point, we need to work harder at it. We have been.'' The hall has been adept at publicity, organizing high-profile <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> appearances by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> _ a native of <LOCATION> Kulm </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> _ and former <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> commentator <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevareid </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Velva </LOCATION>, several miles southeast of <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>. But promoters have been unable to translate the exposure into enough money to put the hall into shape. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> estimates it will take $ 200,000 to $ 250,000 to organize and staff it for a year. So far, the hall has raised $ 10,000 through a car raffle and a small sum from selling memberships, said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` We do n't have very much -LRB- money -RRB- at all,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said last week. `` We're just squeaking.'' Once the hall is set up, <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> believes it could draw as many as 90,000 people annually, paying a $ 2 entrance fee, he said. That is roughly half the number of vistors that the nearby state <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> draws each year, he said. `` We're not looking at any gigantic amount of money,'' <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said. Celebrities such as Miss <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Welk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sevareid </PERSON> and pop singer <PERSON> Vee </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, are the highlights of the hall, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. However, its primary goal is to spotlight <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> groups such as the Boy Scouts, civic club dignitaries and sporting organizations. The celebrities `` hopefully are what will make people come in off the interstate,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` Once they're here, they can enjoy the rest of it ... `` Not too many are going to pull in just to see who the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> water user of the year is.''

 A man with a gun and a `` bomb-grenade device,'' apparently distraught over losing custody of his two children, took 15 people hostage today at an office building in the Wall Street area, but released them within several hours and then surrendered. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON>, a police spokeswoman, said 14 of the hostages slipped away when he let them go to the bathroom, make photocopies or run other errands. `` When the last man was there, he -LRB- the gunman -RRB- turned to him and said, ` OK, you can go too,''' <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON> said. The hostages were apparently unharmed, authorities said. Traffic in the surrounding streets of lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> was tied up by the incident, which drew the police bomb squad and other specialized police units. Members of the police hostage negotiating team moved into offices on the floor where the hostages were taken. The man, identified as <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> and believed to be a former <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T employee, then surrendered at around noon, police said. His former wife, who works in the office where he took the hostages, was in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, this morning seeking a permanent restraining order against him. <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON> said <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> never threatened the hostages or made any demands. She said he told the employees in the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T offices that `` he did not want to hurt them, that they were really not a part of this.'' `` He's emotional. He's in the midst of a domestic situation,'' <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> went to the 25th floor of the building around 9:30 a.m., looking for his former wife, <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON>. <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON> said the couple were divorced three years ago and were fighting over custody of the children. Police rushed his former wife to the scene when <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> surrendered without incident about 11:20 a.m. Police did not immediately determine whether the grenade device was real. The charges against <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, whose age and home address were not immediately known, had not been determined, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubler </PERSON>. `` On Saturday he threatened her life and she went and got a temporary order which was served on him yesterday,'' she said. `` He showed up at her office this morning but she was n't there. She was down in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> ... getting a permanent restraining order.'' EMS Capt. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Khur </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> EMS </ORGANIZATION> technicians evaluated the freed hostages on the 24th floor of the building. `` It appears none of the hostages have received any injuries, just trauma.'' <PERSON> Khur </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Boom in US Exports, Japanese Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports and Japanese imports both boomed last year, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> slowed the pace of its buying abroad and Japanese sales actually declined, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still bought $ 173.7 billion worth of goods more than it sold, up from $ 169.8 billion the year before. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surplus dropped to $ 80.4 billion from $ 83.2 billion in 1986. Dollar figures reflect the drop in the value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency in terms of the yen as well as the actual amount of the goods traded. This drop reduces the value of foreign sales and increases the cost of imports. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the effect is the opposite: imports are cheaper and sales bring in less money, in terms of dollars. The drop of the dollar was so large that it outweighed the increase of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports in the final balance. At the end of March, the dollar was worth 8.65 percent less than it was 12 months earlier, the fund calculates. In terms of actual goods sold, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports rose 13.2 percent for the year, against only 1 percent in 1986. Imports still grew by 2.2 percent but that was much less than the 10.9 percent of the year before. Japanese imports rose by 6.1 percent in the first nine months of 1987, a considerable increase though less than the 12.8 percent of 1986. Exports dropped by 2.4 percent, more than double the 1 percent of 1986. The fund calls these `` real adjustments in trade patterns.'' But it notes that trade remains way out of balance. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> raised its imports by 5.2. percent _ somewhat less than the 5.9 percent increase the previous year But it also increased its foreign sales by 2.8 percent, considerably more than the 0.9 percent rise in 1986. The Germans increased their trade surplus to $ 65.8 billion in 1987 from $ 52.2 billion a year earlier. Taken as a whole, the 21 countries that the fund calls `` industrial'' bought more than they sold to poorer areas: $ 85.4 billion worth, up from $ 66.1 billion in 1986. Neither the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> nor any other country with a communust government is included in this category. For poorer countries, the fund's monthly `` <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> Memorandum'' emphasized the rise in prices paid by consumers. `` Inflation rose sharply in the developing countries in 1987, led by a sharp acceleration of inflation in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>,'' it reported. In the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, the rise was 118.8 percent, up from 82.2 in 1986, but still below the 161.4 rise in 1985. The Third World's three biggest debtors also had the biggest price rises: 229.7 percent in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, 131.8 percent in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and 131.3 percent in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. For the fund's 130 poor countries, inflation was put at 40.1 percent, compared with 29.3 percent in 1986. The rise was moderated by the record in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, where the rate was held to 6.9 percent, up from only 5.4 percent in a year.

<HEAD>Activists Form Network of Groups in Hungary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 About 200 people gathered in a central <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> restaurant on May Day to form communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s first network of activist groups, a participant said Monday. The Network of Free Initiatives was formed after 45 dissidents issued a petition on March 17 calling for the formation of an umbrella organization of independent political, ecological, religious and youth groups in support of democracy in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` We seek to achieve changes in ways already contained in the constitution,'' the participant quoted dissident writer <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiss </PERSON> as telling the Sunday meeting at the <LOCATION> Hagi </LOCATION> restaurant. The participant spoke by telephone from <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity. Speakers at the gathering, which included leading Hungarian dissidents, emphasized that the Network of Free Initiatives wants to work for change by peaceful means. The participants elected about 50 representatives to a council that will lead the new network. In addition to Kiss, they include leading dissident <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON>, Olympic pentathlete <PERSON> Andras </PERSON> <PERSON> Balczo </PERSON>, writer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Esterhazy </PERSON>, and historian <PERSON> Gyorgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Litvan </PERSON>. Also elected were representatives of a youth group and of a newly formed independent union of intellectuals, as well as members of religious and ecological organizations. The meeting adopted a four-point resolution protesting government attempts to crack down on the Democratic Forum, a loose association of several hundred intellectuals, the participant said. The resolution also protested the recent expulsion of four liberals from the Communist party, the exclusion of independent ecology groups from a government-sponsored environmental organization and the death of Czechoslovak dissident <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON> in a Czech jail last week, the participant said. Sunday's statement echoed most of the points introduced in the March 17 petition, which called on the communist government to overcome <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s current economic and social crisis by engaging in dialogue `` in good faith'' with representatives of Hungarian society. The statement also called for a multiparty parliamentary democracy in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The March document, obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, appealed for `` good neighborly relations'' with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> should remain a sovereign nation as well as `` an equal member of the European family of nations.'' The petition has been signed by 726 people since it was issued. In recent months, the number of independent activist initiatives has mushroomed in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Several of these groups have defied police warnings and continued to organize meetings. The participant said the 50-member network council would meet Wednesday night to thrash out a position paper entitled `` There Is a Way Out,'' which reflects the network's views on how to solve <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s current problems. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is burdened by a gross hard currency debt of $ 16 billion, the highest per capita in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. Austerity measures introduced by the communist government this year have meant widespread belt-tightening for the country's 10.6 million citizens.

 A congressman's top aide wrote a poem, then leaped to his death from a luxury hotel the day a newspaper said he made unorthodox demands on male staffers' personal time, including that one perform a strip tease, police said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, 46, chief assistant to Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, D-Md., fell 16 floors from his Helmsley Palace Hotel room on Sunday afternoon after discussing the effect of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> story with friends, police said One friend said <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> was worried Sunday morning that the article had irreparably damaged his career but did n't seem depressed. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> and another aide were in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to meet with a lawyer and attend the Broadway musical `` Phantom of the Opera,'' police said. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> left a poem on hotel stationery, said a police spokesman, Lt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who would not reveal the contents. He said the death appeared to be suicide. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, who had a room on the 24th floor, landed on an eighth-floor ledge, police said. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> and the second aide, <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Skipper </PERSON>, had checked out by this morning, said a hotel detective who spoke on condition he not be identified. Today, <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which said it did not know his whereabouts, issued a brief statement by <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> expressing sympathy to <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>' friends and family. `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> was my friend and political ally for almost two decades,'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said. `` All of us who had the privilege of working with him will miss him more than we can say.'' In Sunday's front-page story in the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> staffers said <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> had taken control of the office from the 39-year-old Democrat, and that <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> pressured male staffers to socialize with <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>. One staffer quit and another was fired after they refused to attend a private party <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> held at a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> hotel suite last November, the newspaper reported. Staffers told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, who was divorced, told one male staffer he would have to perform a strip tease in 1987 at an office retreat in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The staffer refused, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The article came as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigates allegations <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s campaign disclosure reports concealed $ 6,650 in payments to <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, who was paid $ 72,200 as <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s administrative assistant last year, also owns a company, <ORGANIZATION> Pappenbauer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, that received $ 119,642 in fees and expenses since 1980, a revised <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> campaign report shows. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> helped engineer <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s first election to the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 and his successful 1980 bid to unseat Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON>, after the conservative Republican was arrested for soliciting sex from a 16-year-old male prostitute. The charge later was dropped but <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> acknowledged he was homosexual and an alcoholic. Political consultant <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said he talked by phone with <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> about the Post article for 25 minutes Sunday morning. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> he was worried that the article had irreparably damaged his career and had hurt <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s re-election chances, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. `` I told him, ` You've done nothing illegal, you've done nothing immoral and therefore I think you can deal with this,''' <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said, adding he did n't believe <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> was depressed. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, however, `` felt in his own mind that it was a fait accompli _ that nothing could be done about it,'' <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said. Those interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said they did not believe that the pressure to socialize with <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> and others on the staff went beyond the dinners and events that <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> organized. One press secretary, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Ourth </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> he was hired with the requirement that he not date for a year. When Ourth began dating, `` He called me the ` wayward son,''' Ourth recalled. `` He told me, ` You've lost the focus.''' Ourth quit six months after taking the job. Sunday's article quoted a memo from <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> dated Nov. 14 as saying, `` ... it is important for everyone on this staff to remember that <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> is the chief of staff, responsible for everyone's paycheck When he expresses a wish, however slight, it should be taken seriously.'' A classified ad in the Hannibal -LRB- Mo. -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Post </ORGANIZATION> placed by <ORGANIZATION> Pappenbauer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> offered salaries up to $ 50,000. `` Wanted A Young Man in A Hurry,'' it said, asking, `` Are you single and willing to travel?'' The ad asked for a writing sample and recent photograph. Former aides were quoted as saying <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> excluded female staffers from his social activities. Lawyers for the <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> campaign advised <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> not to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Trippi </PERSON>, a campaign spokesman. Neighbors and former staff members told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, who is single, frequently stayed at <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>' large frame house in <LOCATION> Accokeek </LOCATION>, Md.

 A fugitive suspected in a two-year crime spree that included bank robberies and a shootout with police has been tracked down through his fascination with high-performance cars. Forty <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents staked out an auto show at <LOCATION> Hershey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and arrested <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnick </PERSON>, a convicted bank robber accused in a series of crimes in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> area. He was armed but was arrested without incident Saturday. In <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyzer </PERSON> today scheduled a preliminary hearing and bail hearing Thursday morning for <PERSON> Minnick </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corless </PERSON> said <PERSON> Minnick </PERSON>'s arrest was based in part on a profile that reflected <PERSON> Minnick </PERSON>'s interest in race cars and his habit of frequenting automotive flea markets. Agents also received a tip that <PERSON> Minnick </PERSON> would be at the show, but would not say where it came from. Agents posing as gate attendants at the auto show spotted <PERSON> Minnick </PERSON> when he entered and identified him from an `` X'' tattoo on his left hand, <PERSON> Corless </PERSON> said. He was carrying two concealed handguns and $ 15,000, <PERSON> Corless </PERSON> said. A search of his car turned up more weapons, including a fully loaded machine gun with five loaded magazines, a shotgun, a couple of switchblade knives and a machete. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents had been trying to apprehend <PERSON> Minnick </PERSON>, 40, since February 1986, when he escaped from <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> after his alleged involvement in an armed holdup of a supermarket and a shootout with <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Crossbreeding between prairie chickens and grouse is common, but one prairie chicken has taken things a step further by courting a brown pickup truck as the object of his affections. He arrived at the J.B. and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> ranch 23 miles south of here in late March and has stayed, probably hoping he can convince the pickup to agree to a mixed marriage of sorts. `` He likes my pickup,'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. `` He runs toward it whenever I drive across the meadow, stamps his feet and performs his ritual for me. I have seen a few grouse near where he stays, but he tends to ignore them.'' Prairie chickens `` boom'' and grouse `` dance'' as they gather for their spring courtship rituals, which are common to both species and are similar. Prairie chickens inflate large orange air sacs on their neck, erect tufts of neck feathers and produce a deep resonant `` boom'' that can be heard for nearly a mile in calm weather.

 When the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Woodland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> became a little too gnarly for Principal <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutgen </PERSON>, he thought it was time students gave him a lesson in the slang of the day. `` I'd hear things,'' he said, `` and I'd think, gosh, is that good or bad or indifferent?'' The principal found his answer in `` Slang Struck: A Handbook for Parents To Better Understand What We're Talking About,'' a 137-word, student-compiled guide. The idea for the handbook came from English teacher <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Heintzman </PERSON>. Encouraged by the principal, she tacked a piece of poster board on the classroom wall and invited students to write in and `` keep it clean.'' Included in the handbook are such terms as babe -LRB- nice-looking -RRB-; stud muffin -LRB- nice-looking male -RRB-; majorly -LRB- very, very important -RRB-; sweetness -LRB- special -RRB-; and gnarly -LRB- cool -RRB-. But the new handbook is in danger of obsolescence already. Some of the words in `` Slang Struck'' already have different meanings.

<HEAD>Dukakis Slowly Brings Lieutenant Governor Into Statehouse Inner
Circle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The day after the March 15 presidential primary in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hustled home for a meeting on a thorny state subject: furloughs for first-degree murderers. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> attended the closed-door meeting of the anti-crime council, and when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> realized that it was the first time his potential successor had attended the top-level monthly gathering, he made her a permanent council member on the spot. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> slowly has brought his lieutenant governor closer to the center of state government as his chances of winning the Democratic presidential nomination have improved. As that has happened, advocates, lobbyists and interest groups have begun seeking out the first woman to hold statewide office in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> history. `` There have been people coming into my office since early last year wanting to sort of talk about the ` what ifs?''' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I've carefully stayed away from that because it seemed to me the most important thing I can do for him is to stay focused on the day to day managing of this state.'' She still does not meet regularly with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ weekly meetings are scheduled to begin later this month. And she has performed largely ceremonial duties as lieutenant governor, other than lobbying for administration priorities and sitting on boards such as the local government advisory council. `` The agreement has been that the governor will set the policy and <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> will help us execute it just like the rest of us,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' chief secretary, <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> Champion. Only if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins the nomination, Champion said, would <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> be brought inside the administration. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he has no intention of yielding office unless he wins in November; and even then, he said he might not step down as governor until he is inaugurated as presient. `` Nobody asked <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to resign from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>; nobody has asked <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to resign the vice presidency,'' he said recently. Despite her two stints as a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cabinet secretary, some distance remains between the state's two top elected officials. In 1986, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> operatives worked behind the scenes in an unsuccessful effort to block <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s nomination for the lieutenant governorship. At the 1986 state convention, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides leaked the story that <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was a political traitor after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' defeat in 1978 by trying to stay on in the administration of political archrival <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. In 1982, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> won no friends in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp when she remained neutral in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' successful comeback bid against King. Today, she says her role remains limited because it allows <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to demonstrate leadership at home. But it also leaves her politically vulnerable, should she inherit the governorship, to fiscal decisions the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration makes now. `` It is for him a very important aspect of his campaign nationally to be able to show people throughout the country as the governor of this state and as a political candidate and as a political leader what he can do,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. As the state's fiscal picture has tightened recently, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> has taken an increasing interest in planning the state budget that will carry into next year _ beyond the presidential inauguration. By June, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said she will present <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> her budget analysis and outline possible disagreements with the governor's plan. `` From the day the governor set off to be president over a year ago now, <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> Champion and I have been meeting daily, building up the agenda of discussion,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 47, served as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' secretary of environmental affairs in his first term and as secretary of economics early in his second term. She holds a doctorate in economics from <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. As is the case with any lieutenant governor or even the vice president, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> has few official duties. She has spent her time on a project called Blueprint 2000, a program to map out the state's future in areas such as transportation and economics.

 `` Romance Romance'' is a hit and a miss. The show, which opened Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Helen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hayes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>, is made up of two one-act musicals, a form of song and dance rarely seen on Broadway. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnick </PERSON> tried it more than 20 years ago with `` The Apple Tree,'' musical versions of short stories by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiffer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>. They had varying degrees of success. So do the creators of `` Romance Romance.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>, who supplied the book, lyrics and direction, and <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, who wrote the music, have gone to a short story by <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> and a play by <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Renard </PERSON> for their double bill. It's the curtain raiser, `` The Little Comedy,'' that proves to be the more agreeable. The witty <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> short story, set in turn-of-the-century <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, adapts well to the stage. The tale is told in the form of letters to old friends. The format is not as confining as one might think because the missives are acted out by the two main characters. The letter writers, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> and <PERSON> Josefine </PERSON>, are bored, jaded members of the Viennese upper crust. They toss away lovers like yesterday's strudel. For a little excitement, the two of them go slumming and meet in a park. He pretends to be a penniless poet. She becomes a poor shopgirl. Poverty attracts, at least for a while. Reality finally sets in, and both are relieved to discover they are from the same wealthy social set. The two lovers will get married. But do n't expect the union to last, they both say at the fadeout. <PERSON> Harman </PERSON> keeps the slender story spinning and although his rhymes are often predictable, they at least illuminate the characters or advance the tightly focused plot. <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>'s music has the appropriate old world charm, especially a lilting title song. `` The Little Comedy'' is a crisp confection topped with just the right amount of sour cream. But things turn soggy in Act 2, a moist little musical called `` Summer Share.'' The locale is a trendy Hamptons beach house shared by two married couples. <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> is <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s best friend, even though they are married to other people. So how long will it be before they have an affair? Well, they think about it for a long time. So do their mates. And so does the audience, left squirming while the two would-be lovers make up their minds. The characters are sketched so skimpily that it's impossible to work up interest in any of them, especially after they keep insisting how wonderful their marriages are. Although `` Summer Share'' claims to be the more modern of the two shows, it is also the more sentimental and shopworn. The evening ends with the characters urging theatergoers to `` cherish your romantic notions.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> is an ingratiating, handsome leading man. He's rakish and debonair in the first musical, pensive and appealing in the second As the unrepentant coquette, <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> is perfection in the first act, but the sappy material defeats her in the second musical. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoshour </PERSON> are properly morose as the left-out spouses in Act 2. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>'s modest settings are in keeping with the modest tone of the whole evening, while <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' costumes capture the spirit of both eras. The musicals, originally done last fall at a tiny off-off-Broadway theater, have undergone some reworking in their transfers to the larger <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>. `` Summer Share'' received the biggest rehab, but the fixing did n't do much good. `` Romance Romance'' offers two looks at love, one lively, the other leaden. Stay until intermission and you'll have an entertaining time.

 What other critics said: In the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said `` ` Romance, Romance,' lately the littlest musical off-off-Broadway, has made it uptown, in a slightly enhanced production that loses nothing of the charm and intelligence of the original ... In a Broadway season so full of pretentiousness, this show is delightfully small scale ...'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> wrote, `` For all its virtues, ` Romance, Romance' is a show that keeps you at a distance ... Ultimately, the material is arch and clever. You do n't feel you're rediscovering simple affection Rather, you feel you're being let in on a joke.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said, `` Just as the evening is a pair of sketches, the show's joys and disappointments are mixed.'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> praised the two leads, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, but added, `` The sad thing is that the musical _ or at least the music _ does n't really support them.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Monday urged the Polish government to negotiate with its labor unions and to refrain from using force against striking workers. `` The current strikes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> demonstrate more clearly than ever that successful economic reform and recovery require genuine dialogue between the government and society,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` In our view, such dialogue must allow for the expression of working peoples' concerns and rights.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> added that `` the use of force ... can not contribute to national reconciliation.'' The Solidarity trade union movement complained of `` exceptional brutality'' by police in clashes with protesters Sunday in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Thousands of Polish workers are striking to back demands for increased pay to offset price hikes of 42 percent caused by the government's austerity program. The week-long work stoppages are described as the worst labor unrest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since the communist government suspended Solidarity in December 1981. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports the Polish government's economic reform program and is willing to help in its implementation But he added that `` such help is feasible only if the difficult economic changes needed are supported by a broad spectrum of Polish society.'' The reforms that began in 1986 have included a thinning of the government bureaucracy and encouragement of private enterprise. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was willing to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ if agreement is reached between the government and the unions _ by supporting its loan requests to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> owes some $ 40 billion, the largest chunk to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and a `` significant'' sum to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the official said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which is the largest contributor to both institutions, would be willing to support loan programs `` if <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is serious'' about future reforms, said the official, who spoke only on condition he not be named. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> improved its ties with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after the Polish government released all political prisoners at the end of 1986. Cultural and economic ties were restored, and both countries exchanged ambassadors in March.

<HEAD>Militants Reject Offer To Trade Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Melanesian separatists rejected an offer Monday by three rightist elected officials to trade places with nearly two dozen police hostages being held in a cave. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ukeiwe </PERSON>, who represents this <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island territory in the French <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, announced at a meeting of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s new regional assembly that he and two <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> members, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Nenou </PERSON>, wished to `` take the place of the hostages to bring an end to their ordeal.'' <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, minister for overseas territories in Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s conservative government, praised the offer and said it could bring movement in the stalemated hostage drama. <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Leques </PERSON> ordered all offices, shops, schools and bars closed at 4 p.m. in support of the idea. Even taxi drivers stopped work in the capital, a stronghold of pro-French, anti-independence sentiment. But the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rejected the offer and repeated its demand for a mediator to negotiate terms for a referendum on independence for the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island territory. `` We want someone who would be representative of the colonial power, who would have authority to commit the colonial power,'' <PERSON> Hnalaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Uregei </PERSON>, a member of the front's political bureau, told a news conference. He said the proposal from the three officials was `` at the same time grotesque, ridiculous and indecent'' and said they knew it would not be taken seriously. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> has become an issue in next Sunday's presidential election between Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who urges dialogue with the separatists, and <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who calls them a small band of terrorists. A recent opinion poll in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> found 41 percent in favor of independence for the territory, 34 percent opposed and 25 percent giving no opinion. But among those who voted for <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> in the first round April 24, only 24 percent back independence and 58 percent want to keep <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> part of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Ukeiwe, <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nenou </PERSON> are members of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s rightist party, the Rally for the Republic, and are prominent opponents of the separatist movement. About 43 percent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s 145,000 people are native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, and many of them favor independence. About 36 percent are Europeans, who generally want to remain part of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The rest are mostly Asian or Polynesian. On April 22, the rebels raided a rural police post on the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, seized 27 military policemen and killed four others. They released 12 hostages but took eight more, including the head of an anti-terrorism squad and an assistant prosecutor. The remaining hostages are being held in a cave in a remote part of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, which lies off the east coast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s main island, La Grande Terre. The prosecutor and the anti-terrorism squad leader were allowed to leave the cave hideout and ordered to negotiate on behalf of the terrorists, but were old the remaining hostages would be killed if the two did not return. Because of that threat, authorities still consider them hostages for a total of 23. The front, which calls the 23 `` prisoners of war,'' said in a statement Monday that they were `` in good health and well cared-for.''

<TEXT>
 American Jewish leaders said Monday they will hold a religious service and a vigil in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit as a way of drawing attention to the plight of Soviet Jews. The events, organized by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewry </ORGANIZATION>, will take place May 27-28 while President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is scheduled to fly to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on May 29 for the three-day summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, has been invited to the Friday night service at the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> synagogue. Organizers said they did not know if he would attend. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, chairman of the national conference, told reporters the activities in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> are designed to impress upon Soviet leaders the conference's commitment to seeing Soviet Jews accorded more freedom. He said his group will continue the campaign `` to free Soviet Jewry so they can emigrate ... and to permit those who wish to remain to live as Jews without any limitations and without any discrimination against them.'' The conference estimates that as many as 400,000 Jews are seeking to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but have been denied exit permits. There are more than 2 million Jews in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has about one-fifth of the world's Jewish population. Jews have been persecuted for practicing their faith in the state-controlled society and are often discriminated against. Soviet Jews are planning an event in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during the summit, but conference officials refused to provide details, fearing organizers might be subjected to harassment by Soviet officials. When <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a summit last December, supporters of Soviet Jews staged a massive demonstration near the White House. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended that rally. <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Maass </PERSON>, head of the conference's <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> task force, also said they want the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to abide by the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act that proclaimed that people have a right to leave a country freely. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other Soviet officials have voiced irritation at the attention the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> focuses on human rights. In recent speeches <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has urged the Soviets to allow more freedom of speech and religion, and his aides say he will revisit that subject in a talk Wednesday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The conference will hold a day-long `` Summit Action Day for Soviet Jews'' Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is to speak. Also attending will be <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Begun </PERSON>, a mathematician who was allowed to emigrate in January after spending many years in Soviet labor camps. The American Jews say that under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the treatment of Soviet Jews has been mixed. On the one hand, there has been some improvement in cultural life, such as the creation of a Hebrew study group in one region. But the number of Jews allowed to emigrate is still a trickle compared with the 1970s, and some emigration laws have been tightened.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> closed a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> weekly today, charging it was funded by terrorist groups, and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-ager was electrocuted while climbing on a utility pole with an outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag. This afternoon, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops mounted a major offensive into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, pushing more than five miles into the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in pursuit of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations carried no reports of any such troop movement. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> shut down the Jerusalem-based <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Awdah </PERSON>, a weekly published in English and Arabic, determining it was `` a tool for terror organizations,'' according to ministry spokeswoman <PERSON> Tova </PERSON> <PERSON> Elinson </PERSON>. The closure order was delivered today to magazine editor <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kareen </PERSON>, who also heads the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The press service was a key source of information on the occupied territories before it was banned for six months beginning March 30. It has maintained contacts with foreign journalists. Israeli officials have padlocked several Arab news organizations since unrest erupted in the occupied territories five months ago. They contend the organizations have helped fuel Arab riots. <PERSON> Kareen </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Awdah </PERSON> received funding from terror groups. He said money to run the magazine came from subscribers. `` This was a political decision,'' <PERSON> Kareen </PERSON> said. `` Maltreatment of journalists has become government policy.'' <PERSON> Kareen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Awdah </PERSON>, which was founded six years ago and has a combined circulation of about 10,000, was the first Palestinian publication to interview Israelis face-to-face in an effort to promote dialogue. `` Now, the only relationship left is of occupied and occupier,'' <PERSON> Kareen </PERSON> said. `` The occupier will harass, the occupied will resist, and dreams of having a dialogue ... seem the product of naivete.'' In a related development, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard an appeal from the Israeli editor of a left-wing newspaper who was arrested five days ago and has been denied a meeting with her lawyer. <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> was one of three Israeli editors of the pro-Arab <PERSON> Derech </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanitzotz </PERSON> who were arrested for security offenses over the past few weeks. The newspaper was shut down in February on charges of being connected to the Democratic Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a Syrian-backed Palestinian faction led by <PERSON> Nayef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON>. State prosecutor <PERSON> Malhiel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballas </PERSON> argued Ms. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>' lawyer was likely to leak to the public details of the secret investigation if she saw her client. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdulhak </PERSON>, 16, from the village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wazan </LOCATION>, died Sunday night in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, the army said. Hospital officials quoted family members as saying he was electrocuted when he was ordered to remove a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag from a utility pole. The army said he apparently was killed while hanging a flag. In south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, members of the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia repulsed an attack by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> guerrillas who shelled a militia outpost in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> returned fire, aiming at guerrilla bases north of the security zone, the report said. It did not provide further details. Army officials said they were checking the report. On Sunday, the army suspended an officer in command of soldiers who killed an Arab stonethrower, and 13 Palestinians were injured in scattered clashes with Israeli troops throughout the occupied territories. The protests broke out as Palestinians responded to a call by underground leaders to hold a `` day of confrontation with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops.'' In the most serious incident, troops shot and killed a 22-year-old Palestinian in the village of <LOCATION> Fakua </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The officer heading the patrol was suspended from duty until the army finishes investigating the incident, an army spokesman said. He refused to elaborate, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the soldiers may not have been justified in opening fire. The shooting brought the Palestinian death toll in the uprising to 176. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> teen-ager and one soldier have also died.

 Members of a congressional committee scolded the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Monday for failing to require that companies establish tougher auditing procedures. Such a recommendation was among several made last October by a private task force headed by former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Treadway </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Treadway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> proposed that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> require publicly traded companies to have independent audit committees, composed of people from outside the corporation, to double-check financial statements. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> already requires companies it lists to have such committees. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, however, has decided to only urge the nation's financial markets and other industry groups that oversee securities trading to `` consider upgrading and expanding the scope of their standards with respect to audit committees,'' <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> oversight and investigations subcommittee Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Treadway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had concluded that fraudulent financial reporting was a major problem and should be addressed by the government `` Somebody's got to do something to see to it that we have confidence in our system ...,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> told <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>. `` One of the reasons the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Commission is drawing pay is to do that.'' Another subcommittee member, Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., said he was `` amazed'' that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> `` plans to pass the buck to others. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> officials were wary of imposing the requirement because of a fear that it would be too costly for small businesses. However, he added there had been `` strong disagreement'' among the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s commissioners over implementing the proposal. He said he himself favored the idea and believed that a mechanism could be worked out to reduce the burden on small companies.

The security vehicle followed the car but could go no faster than 40 mph, he said. `` The vehicle outran the naval station vehicle,'' but the accident was not a result of `` hot pursuit,'' he said. `` The security vehicle did not see the accident occur.'' Long said the speed limit on the base is 25 mph. About 7,000 people, including military personnel and civilian workers, live on the base at the southeastern tip of communist <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Children Trapped After Hospital Collapses and Kills 14</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new wing of a children's hospital collapsed Monday in <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>, and at least 14 people died in a crush of bricks and concrete. Dozens of children, their moans growing fainter, were feared trapped. `` There are fewer and fewer signs of life,'' one official said. Rescuers were pumping oxygen and drinking water through the debris in hopes of sustaining any survivors. The three-story building disintegrated shortly after sunrise in <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, winter capital of the northern state of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>. The wing, completed in 1985, had been lined with cracks. An older wing remained standing. More than 16 hours after the building came tumbling down, Indian army rescue teams were trying to remove the debris by hand and with cranes, but hopes were fading. Some rescuers pulled severed limbs from the wreckage. `` I heard children moaning in the morning, but in late evening there was nothing, a kind of strange silence amid the noise of rescue work,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Arun </PERSON> <PERSON> Joshi </PERSON>. `` They may be dying.'' By evening, 14 bodies and 29 survivors had been found. Some news reports placed the death toll as high as 30. `` But the worst is yet to come. At least 50 children and their parents or attendants are trapped on the first floor,'' <PERSON> Joshi </PERSON> said in a telephone call to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. `` It is a terrible sight up here.'' <PERSON> Joshi </PERSON> said a total of at least 75 children and their parents or attendants were caught in the hospital. A police spokesman in <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, 340 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, said the collapse was caused by a weak foundation in the new wing of the hospital. `` The entire new wing has come down. Much of it has just gone inside the earth,'' spokesman <PERSON> Satish </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> said. The government ordered an investigation, and three civil engineers who were responsible for construction were suspended. <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> said it will take at least 24 hours to remove the debris. `` Until then it is all guesswork, but we fear the toll will go up,'' he said. The new wing, which housed three wards, collapsed at 6:30 a.m. <PERSON> Joshi </PERSON> said the wing contained 51 beds, but some were shared by two children. `` I saw limbs of children being recovered from the debris. The death toll is likely to go up unless by providence the children are saved,'' said <PERSON> Joshi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Joshi </PERSON> said there had been cracks in the ground floor walls. He said a doctor told him the cracks widened Sunday and that he evacuated 35 children. <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, with a population of 500,000, is the second largest city in <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Chief Minister <PERSON> Farooq </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, the highest government official in <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> state, rushed back to <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, where he was attending a ceremony marking the seasonal shifting of the state capital.

<HEAD>High Court Ruling Seen as Blow To Discount Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in an antitrust ruling that could make bargain-hunting more difficult, said Monday that manufacturers do not always act illegally when they agree with retailers to stop supplying discount stores. By a 6-2 vote, the court said such action by a manufacturer becomes illegal only when `` it includes some agreement on price or price levels.'' The ruling makes it easier for manufacturers to avoid antitrust liability when, acting on requests from competing retailers, they stop doing business with stores that cut prices. `` At the margin, this can make life harder for discounters,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, an antitrust professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Noting that bills pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would outlaw such tactics by manufacturers, she said, `` The legislation reflects a fear that discounters could go out of business or find it harder to get merchandise without such protection.'' In other action Monday, the court: _ Ordered further hearings to determine whether a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> man accused of helping Nazis kill more than 2,000 Jews in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> should be stripped of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship _ Ruled that a procedural miscue by federal lawyers must result in dismissing the government's contempt-of-court prosecution against a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> newspaper that published <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> information about a Mafia boss _ Agreed to consider a case from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state that makes it easier for the federal government to turn over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax information to a foreign government _ Refused to let <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> police subject all people who attend <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan rallies to pat-down searches for weapons The justices let stand rulings that such searches violated individuals' privacy rights. The court's antitrust decision is a victory for <ORGANIZATION> Sharp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a setback for a former <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> retailer of Sharp calculators. <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owned and operated by <PERSON> Kelton </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrensberger </PERSON>, was the exclusive retailer of Sharp calculators in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> from 1968 to 1972. During that period, <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> became dissatisfied with <ORGANIZATION> BEC </ORGANIZATION>'s performance. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> contended it was unhappy with <ORGANIZATION> BEC </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to meet sales quotas. But a federal jury found that <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> was dissatisfied with <ORGANIZATION> BEC </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of selling calculators at prices lower than those suggested by <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> Sharp in 1972 appointed <PERSON> Hartwell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> as a second retailer of its calculators in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, and in 1973 terminated <ORGANIZATION> BEC </ORGANIZATION>'s dealership. <PERSON> Hartwell </PERSON> had told Sharp it would quit distributing its products unless <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> ended its relationship with <ORGANIZATION> BEC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> BEC </ORGANIZATION> then sued <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, and a federal jury awarded <ORGANIZATION> BEC </ORGANIZATION> $ 600,000 in damages. Under federal antitrust law, that amount was tripled to $ 1.8 million. The 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, however, threw out the jury verdict and sent the case back for a new trial. Monday's decision upheld the appeals court ruling Writing for the high court, Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said the trial judge erred in telling the jury it could rule against <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> if it found that <ORGANIZATION> BEC </ORGANIZATION> was terminated to reduce price competition in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> retail market. `` There has been no showing here that an agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer to terminate a ` price cutter,' without a further agreement on the price or price levels to be charged by the remaining dealer, almost always tends to restrict competition and reduce output,'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said. `` A vertical restraint -LRB- one imposed by a manufacturer on a retailer -RRB- is not illegal per se unless it includes some agreement on price or price levels,'' he said. If the Sharp-Hartwell agreement had included a price level at which Sharp's calculators had to be sold, however, the agreement could have been ruled illegal automatically. Nothing in Monday's ruling bars a manufacturer acting by itself from continuing to tell retailers that its products must be sold at certain prices. The legislation pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would outlaw even those pricing tactics. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> was joined by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. Justices <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> dissented in a 23-page opinion authored by <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, and Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not participate in the case.

<HEAD>Not Enough AID Money Going to Third World Women, Studies Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> does n't pay enough attention to women in the Third World, despite their roles in farming and other areas of commerce, two studies say. Reacting to the independent studies, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have introduced a bill they say would redress the situation by requiring the AID office that oversees women in developing nations to spend $ 10 million annually. Last year the office spent about $ 2 million. The bill _ introduced by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Reps. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> in one chamber and Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> in the other _ also would order AID to place women in 50 percent of positions in training programs abroad. `` Much has been said and written about incorporating women in development efforts, but far too little has been done,'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said in a joint letter to colleagues. The bill, which has 89 co-sponsors in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, is being promoted by Bread for the World, a Christian group that lobbies against hunger and poverty. That group plans a letter-writing campaign to encourage AID to increase benefits given to women in developing countries, said president <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the brother of Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill. AID opposes the bill, even though <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, the agency's new director, is `` committed to AID's efforts to integrate women into developing economies,'' spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipson </PERSON> said Although the agency believes more needs to be done for women in developing countries, the legislation would create an additional layer of bureaucracy and cut down on AID's flexibility, he said. Agency officials think the legislation is like `` using an elephant to deal with a fly,'' he said. Moreover, he said that while Americans recognize the importance of women in the Third World, AID officials sometimes run into roadblocks in developing countries where women frequently have inferior status. What prompted congressional interest were two independent studies _ commissioned by AID and completed in 1987 _ that said AID programs often are inattentive to women. `` AID's women in development policy is not being implemented fully or vigorously, and there is little enthusiasm and few incentives for doing so,'' <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting group, wrote in a December report. Unless there is agency-wide acceptance of the policy of incorporating women, it will be `` marginally useful at best,'' the study said. While lip-service is given to the importance of women's roles in development, the policy is not a `` serious concern'' for many AID managers, the study said. Numerous studies have demonstrated the vital role women play in a developing nation's economy. In <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, for instace, it is estimated that women are responsible for growing more than 80 percent of the food consumed in the home. Case studies in <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, for example, show that when there is widespread male migration, women's earnings are the mainstay for subsistence expenditures. Women also play a large role in informal commerce, serving as traders and merchants in countries like <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>. In a community in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, women's earning from handicrafts tided families over during a drought. The failure to take women into account can undermine some development projects, according to a report written by <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Carloni </PERSON> for AID in April 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Botswana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> Expansion project was rated highly successful in developing an agricultural training institution. But the project may not ultimately improve the lives of farm families if the extension service continues to bypass female farmers who play a major role in agriculture, the study said. In another project in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, architects focused too narrowly on the domestic role women play, the study said. The women were taught to use a different type of stove designed to reduce deforestation, but were not educated on broader conservation topics.

 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo replaced the head of the governing party with a moderate Monday and was expected to reshuffle his Cabinet after the opposition took control of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. In a speech Monday, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> adopted a conciliatory attitude to the opposition, which won parliamentary elections April 26. Government officials said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> would reshuffle his Cabinet and replace rightists with moderates. `` Hardliners and those with military background are not considered for nomination,'' said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Police, meanwhile, stopped opposition activists from circulating a petition calling for an investigation of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> nominated moderate <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil-jung </PERSON>, 71, to head the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and replce <PERSON> Chae </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon-shik </PERSON>. Other senior party officials appointed later in the day were all moderates. Opposition candidates made a surprisingly strong showing in the National Assembly elections, depriving the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s party of its majority for the first time in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s 40-year history. `` We lost the elections but we have not lost our fair and just attitude. We have no regrets about holding fair elections,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told a meeting of party officials. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said the opposition-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> would pose a serious problem but his party should tackle it under the principle of `` dialogue and compromise.'' Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> emerged as the largest opposition party, on Monday called for a parliamentary investigation into past wrongdoings under ex-President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, 62, demanded that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> probe alleged corruption involving <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and and his family and a 1980 anti-government uprising in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, during which nearly 200 people were killed. But <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said the investigation could be delayed if it would affect a successful staging of the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in September. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, whose term ended Feb. 24, has come under fire for alleged involvement in large-scale financial scandals. His younger brother, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>, was arrested in March on charges of embezzling official funds. Opposition politicians are pushing a petition drive to collect 1 million signatures to demand the former president be subpoenaed for investigation. About 300,000 signatures have been collected, they said. But police Monday banned collection of signatures in the streets for the petition. No official reason was given for the action. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said he would support a probe of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s alleged financial wrongdoings but opposed putting him on trial because he was a president. Aides said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> would once again be appointed to lead his party at a convention scheduled for Saturday. He resigned the party presidency two months ago to help unite the divided opposition. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> emerged from the elections in a far stronger postion than rival opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>. Both Kims ran for president against <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and split the opposition ticket, allowing <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to win.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Surged 1.6 Percent In March</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories registered a surprising 1.6 percent upward surge in March as strong export demand and heavy defense orders reversed weakness in the previous two months, the government reported Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that orders for durable and non-durable goods climbed to $ 216.08 billion, an increase of $ 3.43 billion from the February level. The 1.6 percent advance was the first increase this year after orders had shown no improvement in February and actually fell 0.6 percent in January following a 2 percent December gain. Analysts had expected a much smaller March advance of around 0.3 percent. They said the report showed demand was rebounding following a brief period when businesses cut back to work down a high backlog of unsold goods. At the beginning of the year, economists had been so worried about the big rise in inventories that they were forecasting order cutbacks and job layoffs could topple the country into a recession. But the orders report on Monday, following strong employment gains and big rises in consumer spending, showed that the economy regained its footing in the early part of this year. `` It is clear that we have a stronger economy than people had been expecting. The crash had much less effect than people had feared,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The government reported last week that the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, rose at a healthy 2.3 percent annual rate from January through March, far better than the recession many had predicted. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> DRI </ORGANIZATION> had boosted its economic forecast for the entire year to show growth of 2.8 percent, very close to the administration's prediction of 2.9 percent GNP growth this year. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Renfro </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Alphametrics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a forecasting firm in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said manufacturing orders should continue growing as stronger growth in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the weaker dollar boosts export demand even more. The administration is counting on rising export demand to account for nearly half of all GNP growth this year. `` We are still a very important high-technology economy, producing goods that the world needs, and the strength in orders reflects that,'' <PERSON> Renfro </PERSON> said. The March increase was particularly surprising in view of the fact that only 10 days ago the government had reported that orders for durable goods, items expected to last more than three years, were unchanged in March. In Monday's report, that was revised to show a healthy 1 percent gain in durable goods, reflecting new-found strength in machinery, steel and transportation. Orders for non-durable goods climbed at an even faster pace, rising by 2.3 percent to $ 100.6 billion. The overall increase of 1.6 percent reflected a big 17.4 percent jump in demand for military equipment, following a 6 percent drop in this volatile category in February. Without the rise in military orders, total orders would have climbed a smaller 1 percent, still the sixth gain in non-defense orders in the past seven months. The key category of non-defense capital goods fell 3.8 percent to $ 32.5 billion, but analysts discounted the setback and said they were still looking for strength as businesses boost spending to expand production facilities to meet rising demand. Orders for transportation equipment climbed 3.4 percent while orders for primary metals such as steel were up an even larger 6.1 percent in March. Shipments of manufactured goods increased 2.6 percent to a record high of $ 214.4 billion following a 0.8 percent February increase.

 Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> struck back Monday at critics who charge he is too negative about the nation's educational system, saying it has not made sufficient progress in the last five years. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he gave `` a fair amount of praise'' to improvements in a report issued last week on the fifth anniversary of `` A Nation at Risk,'' the devastating analysis issued by his predecessor, <PERSON> Terrel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. `` We can show some progress since 1983,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` Despite that progress, I can not come candidly before the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and say that everything's great.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the five-year update, `` American Education: Making it Work,'' had provoked a firestorm of criticism although `` no one has challenged any facts in it.'' In the report, released last week, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said progress has been too slow and `` we are still at risk.'' He told the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> that the `` educational establishment'' gave him grades of C's and D's on the report, but `` I do n't give a tinker's damn what they give me as long as they get to work improving American education.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said fewer than 2 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students can write a clear, detailed, coherent narrative and only 3 percent of high school seniors scored above 600 on their verbal SATs last year. He said middle-class kids usually can survive the decline of an education system but lower-class children end up losing their only chance for a better life. `` So if I seem a bit edgy at times about improving our education system, there's a good reason,'' he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the audience they should go to see the film `` Stand and Deliver'' for an example of how American education can be made to succeed without huge infusions of cash. The movie, based on the true story of <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, is about an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> calculus teacher who tames a class of inner city Hispanic teen-agers through force of personality. The kids end up learning calculus and going to college. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, often at odds with teachers' groups, said <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> had never been nominated by anyone for a teacher-of-the-year award. `` Why?'' he asked. `` Because he's an embarrassment. He proves you can do it.''

 Construction spending surged 1.5 percent in March, the biggest increase in almost a year, as government spending offset weakness in other areas, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The department said construction projects were being built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 401.8 billion in March, following a 0.4 percent increase in February. The March advance, which was the biggest since a 2 percent rise in April 1987, was a bit puzzling to economists, who have been forecasting generally sluggish activity in the building industry this year. `` Construction is doing considerably better than anyone was expecting. It is simply remarkable,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON>, an economist and publisher of a construction industry newsletter. The strength last month came in large part from a 5.4 percent boom in government construction projects, which analysts said reflected increased outlays for highway construction that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved last year over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto. In March, the increase of 7 percent pushed highway spending, the largest category in the government sector, to an annual rate of $ 27.6 billion, 16.9 percent higher than a year ago. Residential construction rose a modest 0.8 percent in March to an annual rate of $ 191.4 billion, as a 2 percent increase in single-family construction was largely offset by a 3.6 percent decline in multi-family construction. Non-residential construction edged up 0.3 percent to an annual rate of $ 92.3 billion, with industrial, office building and hotel construction all recording gains. Industrial construction posted a strong 7.7 percent increase, reflecting expansion projects by businesses experiencing high operating rates. The February and March increases in total construction followed declines of 2.3 percent in January and 0.02 percent in December. `` After a period of weakness, construction is coming back, largely because of the strength in the government sector,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said the rise in spending confirmed reports by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that showed jobs have increased by 200,000 over the past two months in the construction industry. Analysts said they were still not looking for much strength in private construction this year because of the high vacancy rates for apartments and office buildings and the continued adverse effects of the 1986 tax overhaul legislation on these types of investments.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Monday of unfounded criticism of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration actions in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, asserting that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts could be set back by `` some kind of macho statement out of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>.'' Earlier, in <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called congressional Democrats short-sighted for cutting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s military requests and said the nation could be hurt if an inexperienced Democrat is elected president. `` Inexperience in foreign policy could hurt not only our national security, but also our economic health,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has previously criticized Democratic <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lack of foreign policy experience. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has already won enough delegates to sew up the Republican presidential nomination, campaigned Monday in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> one day before the two states have their primaries. In <LOCATION> Vandalia </LOCATION>, fielding questions from <ORGANIZATION> Butler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked whether it was true, as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has charged, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had paid <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> $ 200,000 a year. `` I ca n't wait for Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to discuss the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> matter,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied. `` And I'd say, ` What would you do about it?' It's fine sitting out there You see, you can make a lot of unfounded criticism. But what's his suggestion? What's he going to do, and do it in a way that handles the delicate Central American relationships that we're building?'' `` We're moving towards democracy. Ninety percent are now living under democracy in this hemisphere. We do n't want to set that back by some kind of macho statement out of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, after being turned out of office in 1978, lectured at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor: `` One of the beautiful things about being a new candidate without a heck of a lot of experience in foreign affairs is you can make dramatic statements without necessarily having the proof.'' He said he was `` somewhat inhibited'' from discussing the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> because he was once <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director. But he did say, `` When it became demonstrably clear that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved in drugs, we moved against him, with an indictment.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not want to hurt the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people or take steps that appear as a `` great bullying, gringoes-of-the-North kind of overstatement of power. ... We're still living down some of the military intervention of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, he said, `` The country wants to move ahead, not go back to the misery we inherited through the very policies -LRB- <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are talking about.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared at an airport rally in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, then visited an AM-General factory in nearby <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION> and took a short ride in a Hummer, a fast-moving successor to the military Jeep. He told 500 workers he would try to keep their production line open. AM-General has made 48,000 of the vehicles since 1983 and has contracts for nearly 20,000 more. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has shelved plans to buy more Hummers for 1990 and beyond because of budget constraints. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, despite progress in nuclear arms talks with the Soviets, stll faces `` a substantial imbalance'' in conventional forces around the world. He said the Soviets have `` twice as many tanks and artillery pieces as the Western alliance. `` As we seek to reduce our reliance on nuclear weapons, it's critical that we maintain, strengthen and modernize our conventional deterrent in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said `` The Hummer is an integral part of that.'' `` We took a $ 31 billion cut in defense because of the opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a lot of it affecting what happens on this very production line in the future. ... I think it's shortsighted to fool around with the defense muscle of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Plant-Closings Provision of Trade Bill a Sure Loser</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vowed anew Monday to veto a major revision of trade laws and said a controversial provision requiring advance notification of plant closings was `` like playing Russian roulette with a machine gun.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto promise, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting, drew loud applause from the audience of about 2,000 people. They also cheered his statement that capital gains taxes should be cut sometime in the future. The trade bill, expected to reach the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> this week, won final congressional approval in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday on a 63-36 vote, three votes short of the margin needed to overturn a veto. One provision would require all but the smallest businesses to provide a 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. The bill specifies exceptions for companies in serious financial trouble. `` The plant-closing restriction is the bill's worst provision, not the only bad one,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He did not cite any other features he considered objectionable, although the administration has complained about the bill's curbs on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil exports. He said some supporters of the notification provision say it will not hurt, noting that many European countries have similar restrictions. `` Yep, and that's among the reasons for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s poor job performance over the last six years,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` If we had done as poorly, our unemployment rate would be up like theirs, not down from 10.8 percent to 5.5 percent,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` What would organized labor say then?'' `` Anyone who would copy <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in this way is no friend to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers,'' he added. `` For <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, plant-closing restrictions are like playing Russian roulette with a machine gun _ a sure loser.''

 Palestinian factions fought with mortars and machine guns in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s refugee camps Monday, and Shiite Moslem clans battled each other in neighboring slums. Police said 19 people were killed and 68 wounded. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian community was shaken by the discovery of the bullet-riddled body of a prominent <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest five days after he was kidnapped from his home in <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, a Christian port city. Fighting in the <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh refugee camps pitted guerrillas of <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream Fatah against Syrian-backed dissidents, police reported. It was the first such battle since <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> took steps toward reconciliation last week in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. Police said they had no information on what caused the clash, which began Sunday night and continued Monday. Both sides used mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns. Intense fighting kept reporters and photographers out of the area. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s supporters overran three of the four main positions in <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> held by fighters of Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> faction At least eight combatants were killed and 43 others wounded in the two camps on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern flank, the police report said. A 50-man committee including members of several guerrilla factions and Lebanese Moslem groups was organized late Monday to try for a cease-fire, the police report said. Eleven people were killed and 25 wounded in night-long fighting between two <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> clans in the Raml el-Aali and Roweisse slums, police reported. They said fighters of the Atat and <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> clans were battling for dominance in the two districts along the airport highway near <LOCATION> Bourj </LOCATION> el-Barajneh. Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s Amal militia, the main Shiite force, moved in after midnight to enforce a cease-fire. An <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> statement ordered both clans to put down their arms and leave the streets, declaring that violators would be shot on sight, but sporadic sniping persisted Monday. The 7,500 soldiers <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> deployed in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> more than a year ago to stop factional fighting have not gone into the Shiite slums. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> keeps about 25,000 soldiers in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and is the main power broker after 13 years of civil war. Maronite bishops held a special meeting Monday and declared the slaying of Monsignor <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Khreish </PERSON> a `` monstrous crime.'' A hunter found his body, which had at least 30 bullet wounds, in a pine forest Sunday near <LOCATION> Ghazir </LOCATION>, a mountain resort in the Christian hearland north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Khreish </PERSON>, 53, head of the sect's religious affairs court and nephew of former Patriarch <PERSON> Antonios </PERSON> <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Khreish </PERSON>, was kidnapped April 26. His body was clad in pajamas and his face bore marks of physical torture, police said. `` The culprits deserve the excommunication punishment,'' said the statement issued after the bishops met at <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION>, the home of Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> about 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Their reference to excommunication suggests the bishops believe Christians killed <PERSON> Khreish </PERSON> in a factional dispute. Police said they had no information about a possible motive. <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and Ghazir are controlled by the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia. No mention of the militia was made in the bishops's statement. It urged <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s president and army commander, both Maronites, to `` exert utmost efforts to find the murderers and bring them to justice.'' The bishops expressed `` profound concern over worsening security conditions'' and said <PERSON> Khreish </PERSON>'s murder was `` aimed at discrediting the church and its role in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' Funeral services were scheduled for Tuesday in <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION> and burial will be at <LOCATION> Ein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ibil </LOCATION>, the priest's hometown in the `` security zone'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains just north of its burder with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 Tank-led Israeli troops on Monday punched into southeast <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in `` hot pursuit'' of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas, police reported. They said initial reports from the area in the western sector of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> indicated at least three guerrillas were taken prisoner in the late-evening thrust. `` We have no information yet about the size of the attacking force or the distance it covered in the penetration,'' said a spokesman at <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s police headquarters in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He can not be identified under standing regulations. The spokesman said he could not comment on a report by the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television network that about 2,000 Israeli troops had crossed into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in search of <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and their strongholds. He said the attacking force was supported by militiamen of the Israeli-allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> contingent in control of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The soldiers moving into the <LOCATION> Arkoub </LOCATION> region in the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> were also backed by helicopter gunships, police said. Squadrons of Israeli air force jet fighters soared over south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s two major cities of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and Tyre, dropping flares and staging mock divebombing runs on Palestinian refugee camps, the spokesman added. The drone of warplane engines also was clearly heard over <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital. But there have been no reports of bombing sorties. The reported Israeli thrust came after a series of cross-border guerrilla attacks into northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from southeast <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Israeli officials said they were checking the reports its troops moved into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 Police said Monday they destroyed a huge cocaine refining complex, confiscated 5,830 pounds of cocaine and arrested 30 people during a search for an alleged drug trafficker wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Authorities said they also found one thousand containers of chemicals used in cocaine processing, an electric power plant powerful enough to supply 3,000 homes and an airfield under construction. The drugs and chemicals were destroyed on the spot. The finds were made during a search for <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escovar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, the alleged head of the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest ring of Colombian drug traffickers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the ring is responsible for moving about 80 percent of the cocaine used annually in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Police estimated the value of the drugs and other equipment seized at the laboratories at about $ 14 million. The laboratories were in <LOCATION> Doradal </LOCATION>, about 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Those arrested said they had been unemployed and had to work at the drug factory to support their families. Another 30 reportedly fled during the raid. Police said the clandestine drug factory was uncovered at the <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> ranch, which used stockraising as a cover for its operations. Police said they were unable to establish ownership immediately, but the factory appeared to be part of extensive landholdings of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cartel </LOCATION> members in the area. Police and army troops have been combing the area for three days in search of <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>. He and three other men are wanted for extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug-smuggling charges.

 Scientists have found specialized nerve sites where a natural pain-causing substance attaches itself, adding evidence that the substance plays a key role in the body's perception of pain Molecules of the substance, bradykinin, bound to the nerve sites in experiments with dog and guinea pig nerve tissue, scientists said in the Proceedings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Bradykinin is released from bodily tissues when they are injured. Researchers reported last year that drugs designed to block the binding of bradykinin to nerve sites could relieve pain in rats.

<HEAD>Concern Over British Sericemen's License Plates Prompts Review</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will reconsider the use of special British Forces license plates on its military vehicles because of fears they mark servicemen as <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> targets, a government minister promised Monday. The Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which killed three British servicemen and injured three in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> on Sunday, has threatened to kill more British Forces members abroad. Armed Forces Minister <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> was asked in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio interview whether use of the plates would be looked at as part of the security review promised Sunday by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON>. `` Yes, it certainly will,'' he said. `` There are a number of aspects we want to look into and that is certainly one of them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said the use of a special block of registration numbers was an `` administrative convenience'' for a group of temporary residents abroad, but several British lawmakers have criticized the plates as a `` giveaway'' to terrorists. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> on Monday quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> spokeman as saying that all cars owned by military personnel and their dependents in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are registered as British Forces vehicles bearing license plates that are not the normal German civilian ones. `` It would be a very small but effective change to put all number plates on the civilian register,'' said terrorism expert Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Clutterbuck </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Exeter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, as quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. Sunday's victims of a shooting and a bomb attack were senior aircraftsmen in the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, which guards air bases. Based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, they were visiting Dutch discotheques and bars just across the border. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for Sunday's attacks with a statement through the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publicity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. Since launching its violent campaign to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1969, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has killed 392 British soldiers there and 24 in mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The organization has a network of support in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

The purpose: to encourage female <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> sea turtles to crawl ashore and lay their eggs. Only about 400 to 600 reproducing females of the species remain. Eight <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> turtles, including both sexes, live at the marine center. These 6-year-old turtles are ready to reproduce, and center officials hope they will breed and nest in captivity. <PERSON> Kellenberger </PERSON> said an attempt at using an artificial beach is a new approach. `` We're hoping that if they're confined to an area where they really have no choice but to nest here, then they will,'' he said. The tank will be partially filled with water and the turtles will be placed there together. At one end of the tank will be a beach area created by putting sand on a fiberglass liner atop a wood platform. A gently sloping sand-covered ramp will enable the turtles to crawl ashore and nest there when they are ready. The <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> species was decimated by poachers who waited for the arrival each summer of the egg-laden females at their only natural nesting area on a <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> beach at Rancho Nuevo, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Poachers sought turtle meat, widely considered a delicacy, and eggs. The nesting beach has been protected since 1966, but the turtles have not yet recovered to their former numbers partly because they are frequent victims of shrimpers who unwittingly drown them in their nets. The cream-colored <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s Ridleys are the smallest of the sea turtles, weighing about 100 pounds. They are found throughout the coastal waters of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and often forage in the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. Scientists do n't know exactly why the <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s Ridleys females lay their eggs on only one beach or whether enough of them can be persuaded to nest elsewhere.

 A South African court Monday sentenced a member of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to 25 years in prison for murder and terrorism. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, 24, was convicted by the <ORGANIZATION> Pietermaritzburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of bombing several electrical transformers. One bombing killed a police colonel. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s case drew widespread attention when armed colleagues freed him from a guarded hospital room in May 1986. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was recaptured last September after he planned to take hostages in a bid to free one of his rescuers, who by that time was awaiting execution. In the highly publicized trial, which ended on Monday, defense witnesses described <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> as a gentle young man who joined the guerrilla group in a state of despair over racial discrimination in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Sometimes I wished I could be white,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. `` Sometimes I was angry for having color, for what I was _ black.'' The prosecution said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> willingly and was aware that the organization waged a bombing and sabotage campaign. The congress, based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, is the main black group fighting to overthrow the government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and end apartheid. The judge and two assessors handling the case said they agreed on the 25-year sentence after considering the extenuating circumstances in the case. They said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s impoverished upbringing and skin color caused him difficulties as a youth. They also said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> had not intended to kill people when he planted bombs. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Eaves Convicted On Three Of Four Counts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON>, who rebounded from a scandal-shortened reign as <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s public safety commissioner to win a seat on the <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, was found guilty of extortion Monday in connection with payoffs for zoning votes. Eaves, convicted on three of four counts, will be sentenced June 27. He faces up to 20 years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine on each count. Eaves was accused of taking payments of $ 20,000 and $ 10,000 from an undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent posing as a developer in exchange for his vote on a north <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> rezoning. The commissioner said those payments were for consulting work. He also was accused of taking $ 5,000 from a <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> developer, which he denied. He was acquitted on a fourth count, accusing him of taking an additional $ 8,000 from the undercover agent. Eaves testified that money was a loan. Eaves left the courthouse without comment after the verdict was announced. He had been suspended from office by Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, pending the outcome of the case. Another member of the commission, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, was indicted along with Eaves. In March, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> pleaded guilty to one of five counts in exchange for a two-year prison sentence. Some black leaders in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> have contended that <LOCATION> Eaves </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who are black, were the victims of racist prosecution. But <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, who also is black, said Monday he did not believe that was the case. `` We've had prosecutions in south <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> recently for drugs among county commissioners who happen to be white,'' <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> noted. `` I was stunned by the evidence -LRB- in the Eaves case -RRB-,'' he said. `` The evidence suggested to me ... that Mr. <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON> had behaved inappropriately.'' Included in the evidence presented to the jury were 20 audio tapes and four videotapes secretly recorded during the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation. On one videotape, <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, who was cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, asked Eaves, `` Will the five -LRB- thousand dollars -RRB- be enough to hold the votes in place, or do we need to do something else with somebody else?'' `` Ummm, I think we're going to be all right,'' Eaves replied. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> testified that he had paid Eaves thousands over several years, including the $ 5,000 of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> cash. Eaves first made his mark in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> politics in 1974 as public safety commissioner under his old college fraternity brother and friend, then-Mayor <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. He resigned in 1978 in the wake of a city report accusing him of helping selected police officers cheat on promotion exams. Eaves failed in a quest to be elected mayor of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, but won election to the <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The jury _ nine white women, two white men and a black man _ had begun its deliberations Friday.

<TEXT>
 Attorneys for reputed Colombian drug lord <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> rested their case Monday without calling any witnesses to counter 22 weeks of testimony that their client ran a vast cocaine-smuggling empire. Defense attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> rested on the defense's first day after filing documents on deals the government made to get testimony from some of the 115 prosecution witnesses, many of them admitted smugglers. `` The government has literally given away the courthouse to get our client,'' <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said. He declined to discuss the move with reporters outside the courtroom. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinbaum </PERSON>, an attorney for co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, also rested his case without calling any witnesses. Defense attorneys often use that tactic `` to keep the sufficiency of the government's case at issue,'' said <PERSON> Weinbaum </PERSON>. Defense attorneys have questioned the credibility of witnesses throughout the case, contending that the government reduced sentences, gave grants of immunity and even decided not to seek charges against witnesses. Last week, <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> had said the defense would take two weeks, and prosecutors acknowledged they were caught off-guard by the sudden change. `` You could honestly say I looked surprised and stunned,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said after the announcement was made. The jury did not show any reaction. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> set closing arguments for next week. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, allegedly one of the leaders of the violent <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. He is accused of smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from his private island of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> from 1978 to 1980. If convicted of all 11 counts against him, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of life, plus 165 years. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is charged with conspiracy and faces a maximum sentence of 15 years. <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> denied a defense motion Monday to sequester the jury during closing arguments, which defense attorneys complained will come during `` Just Say No To Drugs Week.'' The judge also denied a motion from <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> for a 60-day continuance to give attorneys time to go over thousands of documents and visit foreign countries to prepare their defense. `` The defense in this case depended in large amount on evidence from outside the <LOCATION> Unites </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ that includes principally the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> also is also charged in separate indictments in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment accuses him of being one of the leaders of the so-called <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, believed to be responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ a bonanza worth $ 8 billion each year. According to law enforcement officials who have requested anonymity, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> has been presenting evidence from the <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> trial to a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> investigating possible drug links to <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Divorced Couple In Contest for Watauga Register of Deeds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOONE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary Tuesday for <LOCATION> Watauga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s register of deeds pits two people who have squared off against each other at least once before _ in the divorce courts <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> is challenging incumbent <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, his ex-wife. A little less than three years ago, three days after their divorce, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> was arrested on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, his car, for `` swerving in an attempt to strike'' a female companion walking with Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> in a shopping mall parking lot. Of the election contest, Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> says: `` It's excruciatingly painful. But situations like this build character.'' The Fosters were married for 35 years. Foster, the county Republican chairman, says: `` I would be running for register of deeds if -LRB- Gov. -RRB- <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> were running for register of deeds in <LOCATION> Watauga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The fact that <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> and I used to be married has nothing to do with it.'' Foster has attacked Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>'s budget practices as register of deeds. `` The register of deeds office does pay its way, but it should be making money _ a great deal of money _ rather than just breaking even,'' he said. `` I'm running on my record,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. The Fosters had been married for six years when <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> was appointed county tax collector and named his wife his part-time assistant in 1956. In 1962, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> won his first elected office, clerk of <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, a post he held for 12 years. He appointed his wife a deputy. On Oct. 2, 1985, their divorce was finalized. All records of the divorce are inaccessible. A handwritten note on one file says `` Closed to the public,'' while another file is ordered closed on request of Foster, the plaintiff. A deferred prosecution deal ordering <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> to keep a clean record allowed the 1985 assault charges to be dropped a year later. More than a week after his arrest, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> wrote to the state treasurer, telling him retirement credits Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> was claiming as assistant tax collector should not be allowed because she did not work full time. A two-year probe led to a state ruling against Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>.

 Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has decided against sending <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ships to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to augment the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> patrol, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said today. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> is no longer considering sending <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> at this time,'' the Pentagon said in a statement. `` After a thorough assessment during the past week, it has been decided that the current strength and force mix of our task force in the gulf is sufficient to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests in the region and to defend against threats to the rights of U.S.-flagged ships, as well as neutral ships in distress requesting assistance in international waters of the gulf,'' the statement said. The statement was issued after Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters earlier today that he had talked to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> last week and urged that the proposal be dropped `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> -RRB- said it was his current thinking that the guard is not going,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. `` ... The secretary of defense reached his decision on his own initiative, but he did listen carefully to those of us in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including myself, and the leadership, who suggested that this would not be the right time to take <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' A proposal to send <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ships to the gulf met strong opposition from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who believe the vessels are needed elsewhere to stop drug runners. The idea of sending <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boats had been raised by <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials in the past week as part of a review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the gulf. That review came in the wake of the April 18 clash between the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, when <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and planes sank or damaged six Iranian ships. Administration officials announced Friday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the war-torn waterway was changing from the previous 10-month-old plan of having the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> protect only 11 Kuwaiti-owned tankers which have been carrying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships will now have authority to respond to calls for aid from any neutral merchant ships which come under attack, assuming the American vessels is close enough to help. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said a week ago that consideration was being given to sending up to a half-dozen of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s 110-foot `` Island'' class boats to the gulf. The ships were designed for shallow waters and could help patrol the area, according to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and other officials.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is the overwhelming favorite to win Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> primary and repeat one of his two 1984 primary victories. Even front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign concedes <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will likely win most of the district's 16 delegates. `` There is no question that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will take the majority,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON>, a city councilman who has been chief spokesman of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign in the district. <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON> predicted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would win three of the 11 delegates directly chosen Tuesday night, adding `` If the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> support really turns out we could get five.'' `` We should win the majority of the delegates,'' said <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Caraway </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign. `` The way things have been looking we expect a big turnout.'' Election officials say 113,000 of the 235,000 registered voters went to the polls in 1984 when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took all but three of the Democratic delegates, and a similar turnout is expected Tuesday.

<HEAD>House Refuses To Ban US Manuevers Along Honduras-Nicaragua Border</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted easily Monday to again ban any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat troops from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but refused to prohibit <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicmen from conducting maneuvers along the border of the leftist-ruled Central American nation. The decisions came as the chamber began a second week of work on a bill authorizing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget for the next fiscal year. First, the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 276-92 to block the sending of any combat troops into, or over, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. A similar ban had been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in each of the past two years. But it had been changed by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> to simply make it a `` sense of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' resolution and say the ban did n't affect a president's constitutional power as commander-in-chief. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, sponsored the proposal He noted that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has repeatedly stated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no intention of invading <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas are now conducting peace talks with the leftist leaders of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government. `` It may seem to some wise to reaffirm this intention on the part of the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to maintain any threat of intervention,'' said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. But Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., said, `` this perennial amendment is still unconstitutional, in my judgement I do n't think we can repeal the power of the president to be commander-in-chief.'' Before passing the <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> proposal, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 336-21 approval of an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, R-Calif., which said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces could be sent into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to respond to a hijacking, a kidnapping, or other acts of terrorism against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens or citizens of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally Then, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected, 238-147, an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., that would block <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel who are assisting the Contras from being within 20 miles of the Nicaraguan border The prohibition would specifically apply to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military exercises. The Pentagon has conducted a series of exercises in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, which shares a border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel have generally stayed away from the border. The House also rejected, 267-111, an attempt to delete the $ 3 million in the bill which would go for <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> construction plans in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected next week to begin considering its version of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill, and the provisions that separately pass the two chambers will eventually have to be reconciled by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measures authorize $ 299.5 billion in defense spending for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. But the House has already added three nuclear arms control restrictions strongly opposed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in addition to the <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> proposal. More restrictions are likely as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> continues to work through the bill, including a deep reduction from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for spending on his Star Wars anti-missile research plan. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought $ 4.8 billion for the plan, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill would permit $ 4.0 billion, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure allows $ 4.6 billion. The current budget is $ 3.9 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, as Star Wars is formally known.

 The body of <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> lay unidentified in the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> morgue for a month while his family searched frantically for him, badgering police, calling hospitals, even asking the morgue if his body was there. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON>'s family accused the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police on Monday of bungling the investigation of his disappearance, launched nearly two months ago when the family first filed a missing person's report. `` How is it that they did not discover my brother at the morgue when they told us they assigned an officer to us and he was investigating?'' said <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON>'s older sister, <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON>, 38. `` They just did n't do their jobs. `` We're still in a state of shock. I ca n't believe that this has happened,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> said Monday in a telephone interview. The <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON>'s complaint is under investigation and `` there's no comment on it until the investigation is cleared,'' said Officer <PERSON> Ernestine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Ms. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> said the family last saw <PERSON> Allan </PERSON>, 35, a disabled Vietnam War veteran, on March 3, but did n't worry until three days later when he still had n't shown up for his medication, which he kept at his mother's apartment. He had suffered a head wound in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and took medication to prevent seizures, Ms. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> said. On March 7, another sister, <PERSON> Laverne </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, went to <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON>'s room at the Mark Twain Hotel on the city's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> to look for him She found his room in bloody disarray, Ms. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> said. `` We thought that he might have had a seizure and hit his head and that would have caused the blood,'' she said. `` So we started calling the hospitals and calling around the neighborhood.'' The family filed a missing persons report on March 9, but Ms. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> contends the initial officer assigned to the case never came to pick up a photograph of her brother. Police pulled <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON>'s body from the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on March 28. It remained at the county medical examiner's office until last Wednesday when a second police investigator assigned to the case discovered the clothes found on the body matched the description provided by the family in its original missing persons report, Ms. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> said. `` Everything we said that he was wearing when we last saw him was at the morgue,'' she said. `` Why did he lay in the morgue since the 28th -LRB- of March -RRB-? He had loved ones.'' While her brother was missing, Ms. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> said she and other family members regularly called local hospitals and distributed fliers with <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON>'s photograph. `` We were hoping he had a seizure and bumped his head and maybe was wandering around still alive, but just did n't remember who he was,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> said. She said they also called the morgue regularly and even went there on April 11 _ while her brother's body was there _ and inspected another unidentified body found under a viaduct to see if it was <PERSON> Allan </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> said the medical examiner's office told the family her brother had drowned, but <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dames </PERSON> of the medical examiner's office said the cause of death listed on his death certificate was left blank _ `` pending police investigation. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON>'s will be buried Tuesday.

<HEAD>Investigators Find Apparent Metal Fatigue But Say Accident Cause
Pending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAHULUI, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal investigators have found evidence of cracks apparently caused by metal fatigue on the remaining fuselage of an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet which lost about a third of its roof in midflight. However, they say the investigation is continuing and it is too early to determine a definite cause of the accident last Thursday in which a flight attendant died and 61 of 89 passengers were injured. Evidence of fatigue cracking was found at six rivet holes on a metal strip running the length of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. All of the plane's rivets, as well as those of <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>'s other 737s, were being tested electronically in an effort to find any other cracks, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said at a Sunday night news conference. However, in an interview on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' show Monday, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said it was not known yet whether the cracks occurred before or after 20 feet of the upper fuselage was blown away at 24,000 feet. The part of the remaining fuselage where the cracks were found were being taken to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for `` a very careful analysis to see just what relationship it may have had,'' he said. Investigators are always concerned about fatigue and cracking in older aircraft, and the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> plane involved in the accident was an older one, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. An inspection of the aircraft showed that repairs made to two cracks found last November appeared to have held. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has ordered the oldest versions of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, those with more than 55,000 landings, not to fly above 23,000 feet. The cargo door on the lower right side of the plane remained closed until the pilot made an emergency landing on <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> 13 minutes after the incident, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. This added rigidity to the fuselage and helped hold the aircraft together until it landed, he said. Seven people remained hospitalized Monday, all reported in stable condition with fractures, burns and lacerations. Clarabelle `` C.B.'' <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, one of three flight atteedants aboard the plane, is believed to have been blown out of the plane. A renewed search Sunday of waters south and southwest of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> failed to turn up any trace of her or of the missing section of fuselage.

<HEAD>Tobacco Institute Spokesman Blasts Coming Report That Nicotine is

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reacted sharply Monday to the surgeon general's coming declaration that nicotine is addictive, saying `` it is apparent that anti-tobacco zeal has overtaken common sense and good judgment.'' `` To imply that the 55 million American tobacco smokers are drug abusers is to subvert and divert attention from the nation's war on illicit drugs,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON>, spokesman for the industry organization. `` It is a trivialization of the country's urgent concerns with hard drugs and verges on irresponsibility.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smoking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday that a report calling tobacco an addictive drug will be issued by Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> in the next few weeks. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said such a declaration means tobacco should receive the serious attention given to heroin and cocaine. `` If <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> yesterday was really speaking accurately for and with the authorization from the surgeon general in describing his forthcoming report, it is apparent that anti-tobacco zeal has overtaken common sense and good judgment,'' <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON> said. `` It may well be that utter frustration on the part of the surgeon general, because of lack of progress toward his goal of tobacco prohibition, is responsible for this incredible comparison of tobacco use with heroin and cocaine addiction,'' said <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON>. The Office of Smoking and Health, although not directly under <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> organizational structure, is among several federal agencies working at <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s direction in developing material for the annual smoking report There was no question <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is familiar with the contents of the report, but department officials expressed surprise Monday that he discussed them in advance of the formal release, tentatively scheduled May 16. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> will not discuss the report in advance of its release. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> made his remarks Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation'' program.

<HEAD>N.C. Convention Scuffle Could Mean Trouble, GOP Chairman Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISBURG, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fistfights that erupted at the 4th District Republican convention over the weekend could point to a future showdown between supporters of presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and other delegates, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman says. `` Who was right, I ca n't say, but certainly there needs to be more maturity and evenhandedness in handling the whole situation,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> told The News and Observer of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. The confrontation involved the selection of three delegates to the Republican National Convention in August. Competing for the delegate slots were <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> party leaders backing Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. After the confrontation, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters walked out to hold their own convention, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters elected their three delegates inside. A group of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters then returned to the podium, and screaming and fist-throwing followed as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> forces battled for control. No one was seriously injured, officials said. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said he fears possible reprisals from conservative <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members if differences are n't resolved at the state convention. `` When you are a minority party and you are used to being behind, you need all the help and support you can possibly receive,'' he said. `` But it's a very unfortunate threat for anybody to oppose somebody just to get even.''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Monday that he and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are not being held to the same standards, with the news media allowing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` to have Teflon'' while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is required to back up his proposals and statements. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, spelling out proposals of his own, also called for a substantial increase in the minimum wage and for a corporate code of conduct to press companies benefiting from federal help to invest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and not take jobs outside the country. In a luncheon speech to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> civic organization, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would raise the minimum wage of $ 3.35 an hour to half the average hourly wage of production workers, which is $ 9.19. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s staff said he gradually would increase the wage standard to $ 5.50 an hour by 1993. He said a conduct code should establish `` a set of responsibilities to accompany the right to do business, the receipt of government incentives, tax credits and grants. It encourages participation of workers in their companies and a greater productivity.'' Earlier, after a speech to high school students in nearby <ORGANIZATION> Parma </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has not been forced to give specifics to back up his campaign generalities. `` So far the media is allowing him to have <PERSON> Teflon </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, a reference to a situation in which opponents' criticism slides right off. `` In time, that will change,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` The media challenged me to show how I would pay for my dreams. I have done just that.'' For now, however, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has not come under the same kind of scrutiny concerning the priorities he would set and how he would pay. `` So far <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has operated with caution when we must operate with courage, clarity and candor,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. In a wide-ranging economic speech on the eve of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s presidential primary, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sought to give specifics of his own economic proposals in what aides said was an effort to draw comparisons with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his corporate code of conduct would be `` based on democratic values and a common definition of the national interest.'' He said it would make corporations accountable `` not only to shareholders but to all stakeholders, including the community and workers.'' He said he wants to change corporate behavior as part of his plans for reversing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic policies. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also renewed his call for investment of a portion of public pension funds into domestic development projects. He said the program would use federal guarantees to issue bonds backed by development projects and would sell the bonds to the pension funds. He said the program should include cooperation between federal and local governments as well as business interests. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent Sunday night at the modest <LOCATION> Berea </LOCATION> home of steelworker union organizer <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulimeni </PERSON> to symbolize concern for laborers who he said had been hurt by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration economic policies. `` There simply are two dimensions to this campaign,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Besides the race for the presidency, there is also `` a historical dimension. It is part of the thrust to open up the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political system ... the thrust to empower locked-out people.''

 A man charged with killing a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> tavern owner 13 years ago was freed Monday on $ 10,000 bail pending extradition proceedings. Despite Deputy Salt <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellett </PERSON>'s objections, 3rd Circuit Judge <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> VanSciver </PERSON> told <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Binick </PERSON> he would be free pending arrival of a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> arrest warrant later in May <PERSON> Ellett </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Binick </PERSON>'s surrender to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> last month was not as voluntary as it appeared. Defense attorney <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> countered that <PERSON> Binick </PERSON>'s surrender stemmed from his desire to clear up the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> charge. He emphasized that <PERSON> Binick </PERSON>, 40, maintains his innocence. A friend of <PERSON> Binick </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombard </PERSON>, said she was posting the $ 10,000. `` I have absolute faith in this man. I have no worry about him going anywhere,'' said Lombard, an acquaintance of nine years. `` He and his wife have helped an enormous number of people. I simply believe this is the time when someone should help him.'' <PERSON> Binick </PERSON> turned himself in to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> March 14, 12 years after he assumed the name of <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaue </PERSON>. `` I've looked over my shoulder for 13 years on this charge and I was tired,'' he told <PERSON> VanSciver </PERSON> at a hearing last week. <PERSON> Binick </PERSON> said his attorney had talked to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> 72 hours before he surrendered and if he had wanted to run he had plenty of chances to do so at that time. A <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> grand jury indicted Binick for murder in the March 5, 1975, slaying of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Seborowski </PERSON>, shot during a robbery of his tavern.

She talked about setting up this facility and she recounted her history with the drug program.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest private, non-profit drug abuse service agency, will operate the center described by Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as `` a central institution in the battle against youthful drug abuse.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> charged Monday that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advocates policies that would return <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` to the misery'' inherited by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1981, while <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> accused the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner of caution `` where we must operate with courage, clarity and candor.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, anticipating landslide presidential primary victories Tuesday in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, turned <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s comments aside by saying, `` I'm not just a talker. I'm a doer.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, returning Republican fire, also took aim at embattled Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` We want an attorney general that you and I can be proud of, not ashamed of,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has failed to provide sufficient funding for day care programs for children. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> addressed economics as well during the day, calling for a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage from the current $ 3.35 an hour to $ 5.50 an hour by 1993. The last increase occurred Jan. 1, 1981. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> offer a total of 254 Democratic National Convention delegates in Tuesday's primaries. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is heavily favored to defeat <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and may capture 200 or more delegates in the three races combined, thus padding his substantial lead over his sole remaining opponent. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has nearly 1,300 of the 2,081 delegates needed to claim the nomination, according to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count. The slow, steady trickle of party leaders to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' side continued during the day, as Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> IV of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> announced his support. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is favored to win the District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has enough delegates to assure his nomination at the GOP convention in August, and has no active Republican opposition in Tuesday's primaries. The day's campaign comments fit a pattern that has emerged in recent days, with the vice president criticizing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for being inexperienced and advocating policies that are too liberal and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> seeking to prod his Democratic rival into moving to the left. In a day of campaigning in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the issues in the fall would be peace and jobs, and added, `` The country wants to move ahead, not go back to the misery we inherited through the very policies <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are talking about.'' `` Inexperience in foreign policy could hurt not only our national security, but also our economic strength,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. The vice president visited a factory where <PERSON> Hummer </PERSON> defense vehicles are made and promised to try and keep the production line open. `` We took a $ 31 billion cut in defense because of the opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a lot of it affecting what happens on this very production line in the future,'' he said. The vice president later accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of unfounded criticism of the administration's handling of the regime in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could be set back by `` some kind of macho statement out of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` I ca n't wait for Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to discuss the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> matter,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, referring to allegations that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> made payments to Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, now under indictment for drug running. `` One of the beautiful things about being a new candidate is you can make dramatic statements without necessarily having the proof.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` somewhat inhibited'' from discussing the situation because of his past tenure as <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director, but said, `` When it became demonstrably clear that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved in drugs, we moved against him.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned through <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, jabbing at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> while calling for an increase in the federal minimum wage as well as a `` corporate code of conduct'' to prevent American jobs from being exported overseas. In a luncheon speech to the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, he said the minimum wage should be raised to an amount equal to half the average wage in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The most recent <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> report pegged the average non-agricultural wage as of March at $ 9.19 an hour. Half of that would be nearly $ 4.60 an hour, an increase of $ 1.25 over the current minimum wage of $ 3.35. Aides said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s proposal called for a gradual hike to $ 5.50 an hour over the next five years. As for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the news media had created a `` Teflon candidate'' by allowing the governor to escape providing details of his campaign commitments. `` So far, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has operated with caution when we must operate with courage, clarity and candor,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent part of his day visiting a day care center at a predominantly black <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> high school as part of an attempt to court more black support. He also told reporters he had no intention of criticizing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose supporters will be essential to any Democrat's chance of success in the fall. `` I'm not just a talker. I'm a doer. There's no question about my record,'' he said when asked about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s statements. But he had no reluctance about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Republicans, mentioning <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and saying that in his administration, `` There wo n't be any <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Borks </PERSON> nominated to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' He added, `` We ca n't have two and a half million people without a home in this country and young families who ca n't afford a home,'' he said. `` That's not the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream.''

 While criticizing what it deemed bureaucratic bungling, the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it was powerless to help a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> woman who lost $ 1,100 because of bad advice from <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> employees. `` This case is an example of how the government's brain often fails to control the movement of its fingers,'' the court said in an opinion written by Judge <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolly </PERSON>. In May 1983, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> called the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to see whether she could receive early retirement benefits and later use her former husband's work records as a basis for higher benefits, the court said. Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who was 62 at the time she called for advice, was told that if she accepted benefits based on her own work record, she would be barred from receiving the larger, divorced-spouse benefits when she reached 65. `` This information was incorrect,'' the court said Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' sister, <PERSON> Clarice </PERSON> <PERSON> Soven </PERSON>, made a similar telephone call and got the same erroneous advice, the court said. In October 1984, after she filed for benefits based on her husband's work record, Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was told that she could have received $ 1,100 of early retirement benefits, had she filed in 1983. The sisters began attempting to collect the $ 1,100 lost by Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, appealing through the Social Security system, the courts, and writing to their senator and to the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. But their efforts went virtually for naught, as Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> lost in a district court in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. She appealed, but was told Monday the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION>'s three-judge panel could n't help her. `` Although it is clear that under relevant case law Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' claim must be dismissed, we are very sympathetic with her plight,'' <PERSON> Jolly </PERSON> wrote `` She has been misled and unjustifiably denied her rightful benefits at a time when she seriously needed funds ... `` Such is life in the post-1984 Orwellian bureaucracy.''

<TEXT>
 Thousands of undocumented aliens armed with lawn chairs, ice chests and toys queued outside the nation's busiest immigration office Monday to apply for amnesty just two days before the unprecedented program's deadline. Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials hired police officers to controls crowds and traffic, and brought in portable toilets to ease the wait. `` This is an incredible amount of activity,'' regional <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> commissioner <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said. `` The pace is really phenomenal, particularly in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>.'' By midmorning Monday, a line containing several hundred people circled the shopping center that houses the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> office and stretched into an alley. Many of the 2,000 applicants processed by noon had camped out since Sunday evening to be at the head of the line, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, director of the center. `` I really did n't know what to do,'' <PERSON> Zeerak </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, said as she waited in the line. `` That's why I waited until the last minute.'' One woman stood holding her baby in one arm and clutched amnesty documents in the other that were longer than the infant. Others camped out with lawn chairs and ice chests and brought toys for their children. Officials planned to deal with the last-minute rush by keeping offices in the 13-state Southern region open from Tuesday morning straight through to the midnight Wednesday deadline, <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said. They also were waiving interviews with applicants until after the deadline. The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act allows aliens who can prove continuous residency in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since Jan. 1, 1982, to apply for legal status by midnight Wednesday. The filing fee is $ 185 for adults and $ 50 for children, with a family limit of $ 420. People turning in applications Monday received a receipt, temporary work authorization number and an interview date, in many cases not until November. The INS' latest figures show that as of Saturday, more than 1.3 million aliens had applied for amnesty at 107 <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> offices nationwide, <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said. The total is near the agency's planning estimate, he added. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcelino </PERSON> <PERSON> Crespo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said he finally got the documentation to prove he's been living and working in nearby <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> for 16 years. `` I've been living here so long. I've got nothing to go back to in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' said the 34-year-old gardener from <LOCATION> Salamanca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Urueme </PERSON>, 28, a chef from <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, said he wants to become an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen `` mainly to come and go as I please. To take advantage of making a good living and starting a business, hopefully a restaurant.'' <PERSON> Urueme </PERSON> said he and his friend, <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>, arrived at 6:30 a.m. to find line circling the building. Of the 93,000 applicants received in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> so far, 73 percent are from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and 92 percent are of Latin American descent, <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> said. About 50,000 applicants were predicted to be processed when the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> center opened last year, but now <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> says his office will exceed 100,000. The <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> office's crush was mirrored at other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> locations, such as in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallegos </PERSON>, 45, said he and his wife arrived late Sunday afternoon and spent the night. `` It was so we would n't have to be waiting back there,'' he said, pointing to a ong line that stretched into the parking lot of a night club next door.

<HEAD>Christian Science Couple Face Manslaughter Charges in Death of Son</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Christian Science couple pleaded innocent Monday to charges that they caused their son's death by failing to seek medical treatment because of their religious beliefs. <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Twitchell </PERSON>, formerly of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> section, appeared in <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on manslaughter charges stemming from the April 8, 1986, death of their 2 -LCB- - year-old son, <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Twitchell </PERSON>, dressed in a dark blue leisure suit, and his wife, who wore a lavender pantsuit with lavender-colored plastic flowers in her hair, stood close to each other and held hands as they both entered not guilty pleas before Trial Magistrate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. A pretrial conference was set for June 1. The Twitchells, who have two other sons, <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON>, 6, and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, 7 months, were released on their own recognizance. In response to a motion filed by the prosecution, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> imposed a gag order on all parties in the case pending a hearing Thursday on the matter. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mundy </PERSON> requested the order for attorneys in the case, complaining about the published remarks made last week by one of the two defense attorneys, <PERSON> Rikki </PERSON> <PERSON> Klieman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mundy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Klieman </PERSON>'s statements violated the canon of ethics and `` could poison the pool of prospective jurors.'' <PERSON> Klieman </PERSON>'s remarks, published in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, included the statement that the death of the <PERSON> Twitchell </PERSON> child `` was not a crime.'' <PERSON> Klieman </PERSON> argued in court Monday that she was not suggesting that the Twitchells were either innocent or guilty but was merely referring to the fact that the child's death did not constitute a crime under state law. `` It's our reading of the law that there has been no crime here,'' she said. The Twitchells are the second set of Christian Science parents to be prosecuted in the state and the first since 1971, when the state amended the child abuse and neglect law to recognize spiritual healing as an alternative to modern medicine. Followers of Christian Science refuse medicine or other health care on the belief that true understanding of God acts as a cure. According to police reports, <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Twitchell </PERSON> became feverish and lethargic in early April 1986. The Twitchells contacted a church practitioner, who came to their home to pray for the boy's recovery. On the evening of his death, the boy developed convulsions and lost consciousness and vital signs. The boy's father first called a funeral director, who told him to contact the police. The boy was pronounced dead at <ORGANIZATION> Carney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Klieman </PERSON> said the official cause of death was complications from a bowel obstruction. She said it stemmed from a congenital birth defect. Officials will not reveal the Twitchells' current town of residence. <PERSON> Klieman </PERSON> said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Twitchell </PERSON> works in a retirement home and Mrs. <PERSON> Twitchell </PERSON> is a `` homemaker.'' In 1967, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheriden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION> was convicted of manslaughter for the death of her 5-year-old daughter from a lung infection. The Church of Christ, Scientist is located in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and the denomination has about 3,200 branches worldwide.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has decided against having <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ships help the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> patrol the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> `` at this time,'' the Pentagon said Monday. The announcement came amid strong congressional opposition to the idea on grounds the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is needed at home to fight drug smuggling and confirmed a disclosure hours earlier by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary, said he spoke with <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> last week and urged that the proposal be dropped `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> -RRB- said it was his current thinking that the guard is not going,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` ... The secretary of defense reached his decision on his own initiative, but he did listen carefully to those of us in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including myself, and the leadership, who suggested that this would not be the right time to take <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> `` is now of a mind to pull back from that proposal because these vessels are needed to interdict the drug trade. I do n't believe the idea is going ahead.'' Late Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement agreeing the idea of deploying <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels was no longer under consideration `` at this time.'' The statement said: `` After a thorough assessment during the past week, it has been decided that the current strength and force mix of our task force in the gulf is sufficient to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests in the region and to defend against threats to the rights of U.S.-flagged ships, as well as neutral ships in distress requesting assistance in international waters of the gulf.'' The idea of sending <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boats had been raised by <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials in the past two weeks as part of a review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the gulf. That review came in the wake of the April 18 clash between the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, when <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and planes sank or damaged six Iranian ships. Administration officials announced Friday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the war-torn waterway was changing from the previous 10-month-old plan of only having the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> protect 11 Kuwaiti-owned tankers which have been carrying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships will now have authority to respond to calls for aid from any neutral merchant ships which come under attack, assuming the American vessels is close enough to help. Officially, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is neutral in the Iran-Iraq war, but <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has aided <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and critics of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy say the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is tilting too far toward <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> praised the policy change. `` I believe this new policy may discourage Iranian attacks on neutral shipping because it will inject an element of uncertainty as to their attacks on neutral shipping,'' he explained. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> only has two frigates left,'' along with a number of smaller vessels, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. `` They may be discouraged from using their vessels in situations where they may lose those craft.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said last month that consideration was being given to sending up to a half-dozen of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s 110-foot `` Island'' class boats to the gulf. The ships were designed for shallow waters and could help patrol the area, according to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and other officials. But the proposal ran into heavy criticism on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s reversal prompted Reps. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, D-Wash., and <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., to scrap plans to push legislation barring use of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> `` We would have won, we had the votes, but there's no need to go through with it now,'' <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It was a non-starter from the beginning and I'm glad <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> could understand that That idea was going nowhere.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said he told <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> `` the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is stretched thin in this difficult mission of protecting against drugs and I do n't think anything should be done to hinder that mission Interdiction of drugs is a critical issue and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> needs all its resources.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> now has 27 ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and the nearby <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and `` there may be a few more smaller ships sent to the area because the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is n't going,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. While <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> supported the new protection policy, Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., was critical `` I think this a further escalation in the gulf without congressional authority,'' he said. `` I do n't think we should do it. This is a continuing ad hoc, step-by-step change in foreign policy that's being done without congressional approval.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> wants the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to invoke the War Powers Act, the 1973 law that limits a president's right to send <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel to situations of `` imminent danger.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has refused to invoke the law, arguing that it is unconstitutional. `` I think we're getting in deeper in the gulf and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should assume its oversight role, something which we have n't done,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said `` We've sidestepped the issue.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials had explained the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy to him, including the `` rules of engagement'' under which <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> weapons will be fired. `` I just think they ought to be clarified -LRB- the rules of engagement -RRB- and there ought to be a clear understanding among our own people there as to what is expected,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.

 Dutch police were reported stymied on Monday in efforts to track down <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attackers who killed three British airmen, and a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> anti-terrorist unit arrived to help in the search. The Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> raiders struck in closely coordinated attacks on Sunday in the midst of a festive Dutch holiday. `` We have no indication as to the description -LRB- of the attackers -RRB-, nor indications of their escape route or their means of escape,'' police spokesman <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clabbers </PERSON> told reporters at a briefing in this southeastern Dutch city. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard announced Monday night that an anti-terrorist squad officer and an officer from the Special Branch, which deals with national security matters, had come to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> at the request of Dutch authorities. Earlier Monday, another <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> police spokesman noted it was easy to escape through porous Dutch borders, with little time needed to get away to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Three British air force men stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were killed and three others injured in an early Sunday ambush at <LOCATION> Roermond </LOCATION> and a car bomb attack in <LOCATION> Nieuwbergen </LOCATION>, 30 miles to the north. The British <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the victims were unarmed and off duty and were in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> over the weekend for celebrations of the official 50th birthday of Dutch Queen <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON>. On Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for both attacks in a coded message to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> news media. In The Hague, police presence around the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was reinforced but Dutch law enforcement officials refused to discuss increased security measures. The feeling expressed in official British circles in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> was that the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> mounted the attacks in reprisal for the March 6 killing by British soldiers of three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> activists in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clabbers </PERSON> told reporters dozens of residents and bystanders were questioned in <LOCATION> Nieuwbergen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Roermond </LOCATION>, `` but the information yielded by those interviews is very meager.'' He said forensic experts closely studied the attack sites on Monday. Road signs and military radio stations meanwhile discouraged <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from travel in or through the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. About 70,000 British military are stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, along with 80,000 dependents.

 A 16-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was electrocuted while climbing a power pole with a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the government on Monday closed an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> weekly that it called a tool for terrorists. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, police said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops led by tanks and backed by helicopter gunships punched into southeastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in pursuit of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military communique said, `` The army is combing the security zone because of increasing attempts to infiltrate into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for purposes of murder and hostage-taking. The army censored all other details about the operation. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone is a six-to-10 mile wide strip north of its border with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> said initial reports from the area in the western sector of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> indicated that at least three guerrillas were taken prisoner. The Israeli thrust came in the wake of increasing cross-border guerrilla raids into northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in recent weeks. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ranaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, a military spokesman, said the army had opened a new detention center in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> for Palestinians under age 16. Israeli military law in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> permits arrest and imprisonment of children aged 12-16. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said the youngest detainees in the new center were 14. `` We've concentrated the youngsters in one prison ... so they wo n't be incited by older inmates,'' <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said. In the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, 16-year-old <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdulhak </PERSON> of <PERSON> Beit </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazan </PERSON> died Sunday night in <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, the army said. Hospital officials quoted family members as saying he was electrocuted while following orders from soldiers to remove a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag from the pole, but the army said <PERSON> Abdulhak </PERSON> apparently was trying to hang the red, green, black and white banner. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has outlawed the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag. <PERSON> Abdulhak </PERSON>'s death brought to at least 177 the number of Palestinians killed since the rebellion began Dec. 8 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and Jewish settler also have been slain. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said Monday he supports giving up parts of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to form a Palestinian state under Jordanian sovereignty in return for peace. `` I'm in favor of ... the establishment of two states, the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a Jewish state ... and east of it, a sovereign state which has substantial portions of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and includes at least 1 million residents of the occupied territories as a Jordanian-Palestinian state,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and his conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc opposes giving up the occupied lands. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> order shut down <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Awdah </PERSON>, a weekly based in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and published in English and Arabic. The order was delivered Monday to owner <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kareen </PERSON>. He also is publisher of the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, an important source of information on the occupied territories. The agency was closed March 30 for six months. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has closed two pro-Palestinian newspapers and the press service during the five-month uprising and arrested at least 22 Israeli and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters. The army also has periodically barred journalists from the occupied lands, contending that their presence incites Arab protest. According to the shutdown order signed by <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Suissa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Awdah </PERSON> was `` funded by terror organizations, serves as their tool and is directed by them.'' <PERSON> Kareen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Awdah </PERSON>'s funds came from subscribers. `` This was a political decision,'' he said. `` Maltreatment of journalists has become government policy.'' He said the weekly, which was founded six years ago and has a combined circulation of about 10,000 in English and Arabic, was the first Palestinian publication to interview Israelis in an effort to promote dialogue. `` Now the only relationship left is of occupied and occupier,'' <PERSON> Kareen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard an appeal from <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, editor of the left-wing newspaper <PERSON> Derech </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanitzotz </PERSON>. She was arrested last week and has been denied the right to see her lawyer. Ms. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> was one of three Israeli editors at the newspaper arrested for alleged security offenses. The paper was closed in February and accused of links to the Democratic Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a Syrian-backed guerrilla faction led by <PERSON> Naif </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON>. Prosecutor <PERSON> Malhiel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballas </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> should not be allowed to meet with her lawyer, <PERSON> Felicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Langer </PERSON>, because Ms. <PERSON> Langer </PERSON> probably would leak details of the secret investigation. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted Ms. <PERSON> Langer </PERSON>, who often represents <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> security prisoners, as saying she never has broken a commitment to maintain secrecy.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general's mission to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> failed at the outset Monday and he will end the trip after visiting only one of three parties to a dispute over the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> source reported. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he would return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> without visiting <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> supports the Polisario independence movement, which has fought <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> for control of the the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> withdrew from the phosphate-rich territory in November 1975. The secretary-general said he had to cut short the trip because of `` quite a lot of problems in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' but the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> source said the mission foundered because of difficulties with the Polisario. He would not provide details, and spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> had been scheduled to visit a major Polisario base at <LOCATION> Tindouf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, and meet with <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s president He was also was scheduled to meet with officials in <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>. He arrived in <LOCATION> Rabat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> on Monday for a meeting with <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II. There, he said he had changed his schedule and planned to see the leaders of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> and the secretary-general of the Polisario later this month during the Organization of African Unity summit in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. His remarks in <LOCATION> Rabat </LOCATION> were made available to reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> late Monday. Neither <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> had indicated willingness to make concessions in the 13-year dispute over the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. After <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> left the territory, it was divided between <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, which ceded its interest to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> in 1979. Official media in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> had reiterated the irreconcilable positions of their governments on the eve of <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s mission. <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> radio repeated demands for Moroccan withdrawal from the territory and direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the Polisario as a preliminary to any referendum. Moroccan media restated <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s refusal either to withdraw or negotiate with the Polisario, which it calls `` Algerian mercenaries.'' Since November 1975, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> has spent an estimated $ 1.5 million a day defending the territory against <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> attacks from sanctuaries on the Algerian side of the unmarked border. Thousands of combatants have died on both sides of the undeclared war. The 80,000 nomads who lived in the territory in 1975 have fled to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> or safe parts of the desert region. King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> has offered to conduct a U.N.-supervised referendum among the inhabitants, on condition that his 120,000-man army is not required to withdraw before the vote.

 A supporter of political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> took over as chairman of the nation's second-largest local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Monday, but wary party officials have made sure his power is limited. <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the local party agree on one thing: their top priority is electing a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> president this fall. It remains to be seen if they can find common ground elsewhere. `` My main goal over the next six months is to ensure <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> does not go to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> needs to pull together a very clear platform as an alternative to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> austerity.'' But <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who under new rules will run the party's political operations as its secretary, emphasized that the party wo n't deviate from Democratic orthodoxy `` The 1988 Democratic platform will set the message we will be electing candidates upon,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` We will not not change our platform to -LRB- <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' -RRB- goals _ he's going to have to move to us.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> stunned the party leadership by defeating Chairman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Veselka </PERSON> by a margin of 51 percent to 49 percent in the March 8 election. Pundits said his victory stemmed in part from a game of names: `` Jones'' was a more palatable choice for many voters than `` <PERSON> Veselka </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> works full time for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, a perennial, ultra-conservative presidential candidate who has claimed that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> is involved in drug trafficking and has urged a quarantine of all AIDS patients. Three days after the election, the party's 34-member steering committee changed the party bylaws to dilute the incoming chairman's powers. The 664-member executive committee, comprised of precinct chairmen, unanimously approved the changes April 15. A state judge denied a request by <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> for a temporary restraining order to thwart that vote. <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, is the nation's second-biggest election district after <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> will send more delegates to the Democratic National Convention this summer than 17 entire states. Party officials say <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' main duties will be accepting applications and certifying candidates for the party's primaries. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> held its Democratic primary for the presidency and state and local offices on March 8, Super Tuesday. The party does not have another primary scheduled this year. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he will work to broaden the party's voter base. `` I've already initiated a voter-registration drive _ we had several set up around the city -LRB- over the weekend -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` I personally signed up 40 new voters, and we have a goal of 100,000 new voters by the fall election.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> is to be formally sworn in Tuesday night.

<HEAD>Researchers Say AIDS May Hide In Bone Marrow Cells</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The virus that causes AIDS can invade the bone marrow and infect cells there even when the virus can not be detected in blood samples, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> scientist said Monday. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases, a part of the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>, said he and other researchers found that the bone marrow, which is the body's blood-making organ, can become a quiet haven for the deadly AIDS virus `` Our study shows that it -LRB- the bone marrow -RRB- can be a reservoir,'' he said. `` It -LRB- the AIDS virus -RRB- can reside in the marrow, but not be detected in the peripheral blood.'' The finding adds to the types of cells in the body known to be attacked by the virus that causes AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In addition, the finding demonstrates just how challenging it will be to develop an antiviral drug or vaccine to defeat the AIDS virus, said <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>. In order to effect a cure, some way will have to be found to seek out and destroy the virus wherever it hides. `` It is going to be very difficult to eliminate each and every viral particle in the body,'' said <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, because the virus takes refuge in cell groups and apparently can live there in a latent state for years without causing any clinical signs of infection. The virus, called the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, was first thought to infect only T-lymphocyte cells that have a protein on the cell surface called CD4. Researchers later learned that the virus also could invade some brain cells and another type of blood cell, the monocyte. Now, said <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, researchers have confirmed that the virus also can reside in the cells of the bone marrow. This is important because the bone marrow is the factory that makes the various types of blood cells. In routine blood examinations, the test for AIDS involves a search for antibodies to the virus since the virus itself often is not found in the blood. <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said it is yet to be absolutely confirmed, but there is a suggestion that the HIV lives in a type of bone marrow cell that is the immature form of the monocyte. And unlike the T-lymphocyte, the virus does not kill the bone marrow cell, but reproduces within the cell. Researchers are still trying to understand what causes the latent virus to suddenly start reproducing and become an active infection after living in the body quietly for years. <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said there is some suggestion that the triggering mechanism may be the response of the immune system to other infections. This may start a process that, in effect, turns on the virus. <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> reported on the research during a lecture at a joint meeting of three organizations of physicians and clinical researchers. AIDS is a contagious, fatal disease that kills by attacking the T-cell lymphocytes, a key part in the body's immune system. When the T-cells are killed, the body is unable to protect itself against disease and death usually results from opportunistic infections. The AIDS virus most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. As of April 21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 59,500 Americans, of whom more than half, or about 33,000 have died since June 1981, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<TEXT>
 A long battle for custody of a 9-year-old girl whose mother went to jail rather than disclose her whereabouts went before a probate judge Monday in a private proceeding that court officials said could take weeks. The highly publicized fight over <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> began three years ago when 41-year-old <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> accused her ex-husband, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON>, 37, of sexually abusing the child while he had custody of her. A probate judge determined the charges were unfounded. Then, in June 1986, Mrs. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> went into hiding with <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> rather than obey a court order allowing unsupervised visits with the father. Mother and daughter eventually settled in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. But in March 1987, Mrs. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> decided to return to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to settle the matter. When she did, she was thrown in jail and thrust into the public spotlight. Mrs. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> returned alone and refused to disclose her daughter's whereabouts. Her silence drew a contempt-of-court citation and an open-ended term in jail, where she remained until October. Mrs. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> was released after <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> was discovered in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>. A babysitter there tipped police that the child was being sheltered by an underground railroad of women who claim the courts ignore claims that their husbands abused their children The LaLonde fight persisted and made headlines until it headed for the showdown in court. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Probate Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> has barred the public from the proceedings, which are expected to last six weeks. In addition, participants in the case and their lawyers are forbidden to speak to reporters. An array of lawyers and medical experts are expected to testify, but central to the case will be a medical and psychological evaluation performed on <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> last fall. As soon as the girl was brought back from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> took her into custody and admitted her to <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where she stayed more than a month as investigators tried to find out whether her mother's charges were true Although the resulting report was sealed by the court, excerpts were leaked to the media alleging that doctors had found signs the girl had been sexually abused. It also was disclosed that the evaluators had recommended that <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> seek counseling. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> had remained mute for six months while proclaiming his innocence through his lawyer. When he briefly broke his silence, he said said he was receiving psychotherapy. He has remarried. Meantime, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> has lived with a foster family since leaving the hospital.

 A time bomb exploded Monday in the eastern town of <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION>, wounding at least 10 people and destroying a building, police reported. Police blamed the bombing on the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful Tamil group fighting the Sinhalese-dominated government and military. The blast, 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, wrecked a two-story building that housed a Moslem-owned textile shop, said police chief <PERSON> Gamini </PERSON> <PERSON> Seneviratne </PERSON>. Seven of the injured were hospitalized, he said. Sri Lankan military officials also blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> for an attack Sunday near <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION>. Twenty-six people, including two little boys, were killed when buried explosives were detonated under a bus in the port town 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Thirty others were injured, and 15 of them were reported in critical condition. Most of the victims were Sinhalese, the majority ethnic group on the island, said the officials. In a separate incident on Sunday, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, G.V.S. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, was shot to death when Sinhalese extremists ambushed his car as he left a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> sanctuary in the town of <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION>, 70 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police said. A police inspector, a driver and another civilian in de <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s car suffered gunshot wounds The government blamed that attack on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese group accused of killing more than 200 government officials and supporters. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, who was wounded last August in a grenade attack on <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, belonged to the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has vowed to kill anyone who supports a peace pact signed by the government and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> last July. The agreement grants some autonomy to minority Tamils. Sinhalese extremists say the treaty makes too many concessions to the group. Tamil extremists have been fighting for a separate homeland for four years in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and have refused to surrender their arms under the terms of the peace accord. More than 50,000 Indians have been deployed to disarm the rebels, who say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese. Tamils make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, while 75 percent of the population is Sinhalese.

Asked to respond Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> referred to his state's 2.9 percent unemployment rate, its anti-drug programs and the recent passage of legislation guaranteeing all workers health care. `` That's a lot of fire and a lot of productivity,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely Democratic nominee. `` I'm not just a talker. I'm a doer. There's no question about my record.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, winding down his campaign for Tuesday's presidential primary in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, also courted black voters and chided the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> admimistration for what he said was a failure to provide adequate support for day care programs. Surrounded by a dozen black children at a nursery in a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> high school, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to endorse a House-passed bill that would increase day care funding. `` This is the kind of thing we need,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of the in-school day care program. `` We need it as a matter of national policy.'' After singing a song with the children and reading them a story, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> walked across the street and visited a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> restaurant. He urged supporters to ignore polls showing him well ahead of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, but he appeared relaxed and confident, taking time at the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> airport to toss a football with aides. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> headed from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, where he spoke to a lunchtime crowd of several thousand people at an outdoor rally, and was to stop in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Parma </ORGANIZATION> before heading back to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. He said he was not criticizing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I'm just saying that I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are looking for somebody who not only has a very strong commitment to schools and economic opportunity and decent housing and health care, but also someone who has done these things,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the appearance at the predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> was not designed to lure voters away from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. But campaign aides said the stop was part of an effort to broaden <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support among blacks heading into the general election. Greeting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at school was <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, who worked for one of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' gubernatorial campaigns when she was living in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in the 1970s. Ms. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who is black, predicted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would win overwhelming support among blacks if he promised <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a key campaign or administration post. `` I think he has to have an important role,'' Ms. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` But I do n't think as vice president. I think if he was on the ticket we would lose.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stuck to what has been the thrust of his campaign in recent weeks, carefully avoiding sharp criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> while denouncing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He said the federal trade and budget deficits had put the nation's economy at risk. `` If you're serious about good jobs, about economic development, then you've got to balance your books,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He continued to denounce <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plans to veto the trade bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and also renewed his criticism of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>.

 Three cases of Legionnaires' disease have been confirmed among people who worked in or near <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> buildings, and 13 more cases are suspected, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Two of the confirmed cases involve a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> doorman and a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> workman.

 Authorities clamped an indefinite curfew on western <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> Monday after the army moved in to quell three days of ethnic violence that left at least five people dead and 50 injured, police said. Local newspapers put the death toll at seven. Fighting between Mohajirs and rival Pathans began late Friday after a traffic accident.

<HEAD>Inmates Give Up Hostage and Control of Cell Block</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PERTH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Inmates freed a guard they held for 17 hours and gave up control of the largest cell block Monday, ending the eighth serious disturbance at <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION> prison in less than two years. The government's Scottish Office said guard <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON>, 25, appeared to be well. He was held in C hall, the largest cellblock, where about 100 inmates barricaded themselves inside. Soon after his release, a fire engine went into the prison to put out a small fire, the office said. It announced two hours after <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON>'s release that the 100 inmates had surrendered a few at a time. `` There has been some damage to C hall, how much remains to be quantified,'' said a spokesman, who in keeping with British practice was not identified by name. How many of the 100 inmates were directly involved in the hostage-taking was not known, the spokesman said. During the siege, convicts had waved a guard's cap from a window and set fire to pieces of what looked like a guard's clothing. <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> was seized Sunday. Soon afterward banners were hung from a window protesting about the legal system. Guards said prisoners also wanted an investigation of conditions, a better chance at parole and segregation of young prisoners and those awaiting trial. <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION> prison now holds 449 men, 11 over capacity, but the population has gone as high as 600 in recent months. Protests at <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION> since August 1986 include the burning of an entire cellblock; holding of a rooftop by three inmates for 41 hours, ended by an assault squad of six guards; a hunger strike, and destruction of cell furniture. Other protests at Scottish prisons have occurred in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peterhead </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>. Most British prisons were built in Victorian times and are notoriously overcrowded and unsanitary. About 51,000 people are imprisoned in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, almost 20 percent above capacity and the highest proportion of population in the 12-nation European Economic Community. About 19,000 prisoners are held two and three to cells designed for one.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team is to fly to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> on Tuesday to search for the remains of missing Americans at the site where an aircraft was shot down more than 22 years ago, officials said. It is the third Laos-U.S. excavation of an American warplane crash site. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said Monday that 15 military specialists are to fly from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> city in the southern panhandle area of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. The crash site is 95 miles east of <LOCATION> Savannkhet </LOCATION>. Excavation is expected to take about a week, he said. The experts are from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, both Honolulu-based agencies entrusted with resolving the fates of Americans missing in action from the Vietnam War. They will be working with officials of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' Defense and Foreign ministries, <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> said. A total of 555 Americans are missing in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. The remains of 19 missing Americans were recovered during joint excavations in that communist country in 1985 and 1986, said Maj. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>.

 Nearly one-quarter of the boys and one-sixth of the girls responding to a survey on rape said it was acceptable for a man to force a woman to have sex with him if he has spent money on her. The survey was taken by 1,700 sixth - to ninth-graders who attended the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s assault awareness program at schools across the state `` I did n't believe it,'' <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON>, the center staff member who conducted the poll, said of the results. She presented the findings Friday at the National Symposium on Child Victimization in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kukuchi </PERSON> said she was most surprised by the students' answers on whether it would be acceptable for a man to rape a woman if he had dated her for a long time or spent money on her `` Basically, the kids were very much into blaming the victim of the sexual assault,'' she said. Among the findings: _ 50 percent of the students said a woman who walks alone at night and dresses seductively is asking to be raped. _ 51 percent of the boys and 41 percent of the girls said a man has the right to force a woman to kiss him if he has spent `` a lot of money'' on her. The quantity of money was defined by 12-year-olds as $ 10 to $ 15. _ Among students in grades 7 through nine, 24 percent of the boys and 16 percent of the girls said it was acceptable for a man to force a woman to have sex with him if he has spent money on her. _ 65 percent of the boys and 47 percent of the girls in seventh through ninth grades said it is acceptable for a man to force a woman to have sex if they have been dating for more than six months. _ 87 percent of the boys and 79 percent of the girls said rape is OK if a couple were married. `` So many of our kids have attitudes that sexual abuse is OK,'' <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON> said. The types of attitudes evidenced in the survey probably lead to date rape and other forms of sexual assault, she said. Twenty percent of the girls and 6 percent of the boys taking the survey said they had been sexually abused. Thirty-one percent of the boys and 32 percent of the girls said it would not be improper for a man to rape a woman who has had previous sexual experiences. <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON> conducted the survey from February to December 1987, when she gave workshops to students at public and private schools as coordinator of the center's assault awareness program. The workshops have been successful in changing some attitudes, <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON> said. After the seminars, she said, less than 25 percent of the participants think rape or forced kissing is appropriate in any situation.

 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> proclaimed a strike Monday at the huge <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where Solidarity was born in 1980, in a major escalation of the weeklong labor turmoil in communist <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. It was the fourth strike in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in a week, the worst wave of labor unrest since the government's December 1981 military crackdown on Solidarity. The news heartened steelworkers in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, who no longer were the country's only workers still on strike. `` We feel better now,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciesielski </PERSON>, a member of the steel strike committee. Authorities were reported mounting a nationwide roundup of regional leaders of Solidarity. A Solidarity communique signed by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and issued late Monday said, `` A strike wave is covering the country. They are not just local conflicts. They are across <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> because the cause is the economic crisis and the lack of convincing reform policies that would offer prospects for the future.'' Workers want pay raises of 50-60 percent to balance prices, which have risen 42 percent this year because of reductions in subsidies by the Communist government. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, still works as an electrician at the Baltic coast <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> yard employing 12,000 workers. He did not launch the strike but addressed strikers later and announced his support, according to various activists. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> led the 1980 work stoppage at <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> which shook the communist government to its roots and gave rise to Solidarity, the first independent trade union federation in the Soviet bloc. Solidarity was suppressed and outlawed under martial law. Monday evening, Solidarity's chaplain, the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, presided in the shipyard at a prayer service attended by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a newly formed strike committee and hundreds of workers. About 3,000 workers were occupying the yard late Monday, enough to shut down operations, said Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>. The shipyard has a payroll of 12,000 workers. The government press office in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> at first confirmed the strike. But on Monday evening government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> called The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and said there was only a rally by several hundred people at the shipyard. `` It would be rather difficult for me to say the entire shipyard is working in that atmosphere but, generally speaking, the shipyard is working,'' he said. <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said police arrested nine regional representatives on the 13-member <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Two commission members, including <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, were free and whereabouts of two more were a mystery, he said. Union activists said the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> strike began with a march around the shipyard by dozens of workers after a breakfast break. The march grew to 200 people and ended at the main gate. There, while shifts were changing at 2 p.m., the Solidarity activists encouraged workers to strike, union supporters said. `` The strike action ... undoubtedly is in response to <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s call -LRB- on Sunday -RRB- for protest actions in support of the striking <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> steelworkers,'' said <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojciechowicz </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. The workers formed a strike committee led by <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON>, said a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, a Solidarity stronghold near the shipyard. Management agreed to talk to the strike committee Tuesday, <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, chairman of the outlawed but still active labor federation, said through spokesmen he stayed off the strike committee to coordinate Solidarity activities nationwide. The strike by thousands of steelworkers at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> steel works in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> entered its eighth day Tuesday. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s latest labor trouble began April 25 with a wildcat action by transit workers in <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION>. It was settled the same day with pay raises of at least 50 percent. Thousands of workers at the <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> heavy machinery plant in southeast <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> struck on Friday and ended the action Saturday after promises of higher pay. About half the 3,500 workers at the Dolmel electronics plant in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, southwestern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, stopped work from about 10 a.m. Monday to the end of the shift at 2 p.m., government and opposition spokesmen reported. <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON>, a Solidarity leader, said it ended when management promised a raise. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> urged the Polish government to negotiate with workers and declared, `` The use of force ... can not contribute to national reconciliation.'' Police surrounded the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard and checked the papers of people approaching the gates, a witness said. Banners declaring `` Sit-In Strike'' and `` <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shipyard </LOCATION> on Strike'' were draped on the main gate. Police detained <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Solidarity </LOCATION> leader, in nearby <LOCATION> Sopot </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, the Solidarity chaplain. According to <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwiazda </PERSON>, a Solidarity leader, the shipyard strikers demand minimum pay of 60,000 zlotys a month -LRB- $ 150 -RRB-, reinstatement of fired union activists, amnesty for strikers and recognition of a local Solidarity chapter. Average monthly pay now is about 45,000 zlotys -LRB- $ 112 -RRB-. In August 1980, employees of one department of the Lenin shipyard stopped work to protest the dismissal of <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Walentynowicz </PERSON>, a crane operator and activist in the free-union movement. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a little-known union organizer who also had been dismissed, vaulted the shipyard fence and took charge of the strike. In two dramatic weeks, the workers won guarantees for the first independent union in the Soviet bloc and broad social political concessions. Solidarity claimed 10 million members at its height.

 A storm dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>, closing schools and highways Monday, and its powerful wind blew up dust storms that cut down young crops and contributed to two traffic deaths. `` Dust was blowing so it covered everything like a film of oil. You could n't see in front of your face,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> Trooper <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>. The storm also contributed to weekend wind in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that left one boater dead and another missing and believed drowned. The weather system rolled onto the Plains on Monday, spreading locally heavy rain and thunderstorms ahead of itself, and it also kicked out a funnel cloud over southeastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> that dissipated without causing damage. Interstate 80 in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> was closed Monday morning from <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION> west to <LOCATION> Walcott </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION>, then was reopened about five hours later. But police later closed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 287 south out of <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION> because of poor conditions and a series of minor accidents that clogged the highway. Wind gusting to 40 mph created blizzard conditions around <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, parts of which had no power during the morning. The wind combined with temperatures in the 20s across most of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> to drive the wind chill factor to 2 degrees below zero, the weather service said. Schools in <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> were closed and workers in federal offices there were told to follow their department's bad weather plan. State government workers living in rural areas were told their pay would not be docked if they chose not to drive into <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> closed a 70-mile section of Interstate 70 from just east of <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Limon </LOCATION> in both directions Monday morning because of numerous accidents, heavy snow and poor visibility. That section of I-70 was closed for more than two hours Sunday because of zero visibility when 50 mph wind caused a dust storm. Two major pileups on the highway killed two people and injured 17, officials said. A 17-mile stretch of I-70 from <LOCATION> Goodland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> also was closed Monday afternoon at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, which said stranded motorists had filled every hotel along that portion of the highway. The storm also caused some school closures Monday in eastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stapleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, flights were delayed up to 1 -LCB- hours because of poor visibility, said airport spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON>. He said only 33 planes were able to land every hour, down from the usual 75. Strong northerly wind blew across eastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> with gusts Monday of up to 83 mph at La Junta and 64 mph at <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. The storm left up to 14 inches of snow in the mountains and foothills of south-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, with up to a foot of snow in the mountains of northern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Snow also fell in western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, with 4 inches on the ground in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. Eight inches of snow fell in northwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, closing <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s eastern and southern entrances Sunday. South of the park, 5 inches of snow was reported in <LOCATION> Moose </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, where downed power lines caused blackouts. Heavy rain fell in advance of the snow, with 2.25 inches in 24 hours at <LOCATION> Alliance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, and 1.86 inches at <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, the weather service reported. Half-inch hail stones fell at <LOCATION> Sidney </LOCATION> and Alliance, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. Rain also fell over most of western <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and wind gusted above 30 mph at <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. High wind blew across the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, with gusts exceeding 50 mph reported throughout the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>. The wind whipped loose topsoil into a dust storm around <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, forcing some drivers to turn on their headlights in the middle of the day Sunday. Farmer <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pharis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of rural <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION> said about 30 acres of newly sprouted barley was cut down by the wind and blowing grit. Winds gusting to nearly 40 mph in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> about noon Monday tore down at least five power lines and interrupted electrical service to about 1,700 customers, said <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlow </PERSON>. The difference in pressure between the storm and a high-pressure front off the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> generated 65 mph wind Saturday in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, whipping up waves that destroyed a municipal pier in <LOCATION> Redondo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and stranded 1,400 tourists overnight on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The body of a man believed to have jumped from a disabled boat washed ashore Sunday, said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Lifeguard Sgt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hargett </PERSON>. Another man knocked off a boat Saturday near <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> was missing and believed drowned, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Embleton </PERSON>.

 A two-week sit-in at a <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> administration building ended Monday after 110 students were arrested for blocking entrances to protest the school's investments in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> police put students on three buses to take them away from the building that houses the office of university President <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> about six hours after the blockade began. None resisted arrest. `` The blockade was obviously an escalation,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a university spokesman. The students were charged with creating a public disturbance and were all released on their own recognizance, police said. Police intervention was sought only after the administration tried but failed to resolve the conflict internally, putting the issue before the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. The student board concluded that the protesters' actions had `` crossed the line of tolerability'' and had become `` an invasion of the rights of other individuals to free access to a university facility.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said, however, that it was likely the cases against the students would be resolved within the university and that the charges would not be prosecuted. The protest Monday marked the second time in the last four years that there has been a mass arrest of students at <LOCATION> Wesleyan </LOCATION> over the school's investment policies. A spokesman for the protesters said they were dissatisfied with <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s response to their demands. `` In all of his statements he has barely even begun to acknowledge that we are here,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamm </PERSON>, a senior from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The anti-apartheid protesters had been peacefully conducting a sit-in to protest the private liberal arts college's investment policies. The school has about $ 10.3 million of its $ 240 million endowment invested in companies that conduct some form of business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The students, members of the Divest Now coalition of groups opposed to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racist policies, decided to take a more militant approach Sunday after the school failed to meet their divestment demands. The coalition demanded that the university trustees' Social Implications Subcommittee open its process to include student representatives; that the subcommittee recommend total divestment in a final report by May 8; and that the trustees hold a special meeting to vote for total divestment before the end of the school term. Classes end Wednesday and exams end May 17. But <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> told the students Sunday that the subcommittee would continue to meet privately. He promised that it would open its meeting on campus Tuesday for about an hour to student representatives.

 Some representatives of former <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> users urged rejection Monday of the latest reorganization plan involving <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, manufacturer of the defective contraceptive device that injured thousands of women. `` After an agonizing decision-making and education process, we have found that the plan is unfair, inadequate and contrary to the law,'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. However, another representative of the victims, Atlanta-based attorney <PERSON> Guerry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said the plan offered the best deal yet for the more than 196,000 women harmed by the intrauterine device. The $ 3.2 billion reorganization plan _ the sixth plan developed since <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1985 _ is part of the Manhattan-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to take over the beleaguered company. The $ 3.2 billion plan includes $ 2.3 billion to be put in a trust fund for the victims. The plan was presented in a mailing last week to all claimants against <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, including the 196,000 former Dalkon Shield users who have injury claims pending against <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> as well as banks and stockholders. All claimants are to mail in ballots by July 11, with the final resolution of the case scheduled for July 18. In order for the plan to be approved under an arrangement set up in March by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, at least two-thirds of the voters in each class of creditors must vote `` yes.'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said the court-designated <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> committee assigned to represent the women who had used the device estimated that claims against the manufacturer would range from $ 4.2 billion to $ 7 billion. She contended that under the reorganization plan, stockholders and other creditors would immediately be paid 100 cents on the dollar but that women filing claims against the company may receive only 35 cents to 50 cents on the dollar after administrative costs have been deducted. The plan also gives the fund until the year 2008 to pay the women. `` The claimants are carrying the entire burden of all the unknowns in this case. We're being treated unfairly relative to other people,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said. <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Rosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Puckett </PERSON> said the company was satisfied with the plan which `` provides full funding for the amount of money the court has announced as needed for compensation and related administrative costs. This is a plan of consensus which was endorsed by all executive committees.'' `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- committee fought us tooth and nail for all 32 months, and they believe this is adequate ... it provides the full amount of money to satisfy the court,'' he said. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said that if the funds prove to be inadequate, the former users have no legal recourse to sue the manufacturer or <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Surety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the company that insured <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>. She contended that the plan violates bankruptcy law requiring that priority be given to settling claims, like those of the former Dalkon Shield users, before any stockholders are paid. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, who has been campaigning actively for adoption of the settlement, said <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> was right about the law, but he said the courts would uphold the arrangement because the judge found that it was fair. If approved, the award, plus interest and approximately $ 300 million from <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> brings the total to $ 2.7 billion _ a figure <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said the victims could n't get if they sold all of <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' property on the open market The <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> funds come from cash payment in the bankruptcy suit and another $ 75 million settlement from a separate class action suit alleging the company had conspired with <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> to withhold information about the Dalkon Shield, <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said. `` For some people, understandably, you could get the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product, have <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> behind bars and that would not be enough,'' <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said it would take another three or four years to match the offer from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> and said many of his clients were `` nearing the end of their childbearing years and desperately needed the money to finance infertility treatments. They just do n't have the time it would take to get this again.

 President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have supported his defense secretary, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, to succeed him in order to keep <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> out of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told interviewers. The disclosure is contained in `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>: In His Own Words,'' a book based on heretofore unpublished interviews <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> gave between 1964 and 1967. Excerpts appear in the current Newsweek magazine. The book is scheduled for release in June, marking the 20th anniversary of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination. In the excerpts, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is quoted as saying that his brother `` thought of trying to move in the direction that would get the nomination for <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>.'' He said the president thought the country `` should be placed in the best possible hands. And we thought that <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> was that individual.'' Speaking of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said: `` In every conversation I have with him he lies. ... He lies even when he does n't have to.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who remained as attorney general a short while after his brother was assassinated in 1963, described <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> as `` mean, bitter, vicious _ an animal in many ways.'' `` I think his reaction on a lot of things is correct, but I think he's got this other side of him in his relationship with human beings which makes it very difficult, unless you want to kiss his behind all the time. That's what <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> suggested to me a couple of weeks ago, if I wanted to get along. No, I ca n't do that.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> remarked to <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON>, then the presidential press secretary, that the slaying of the president `` was retribution for his participation in the assassinations'' of the one-time leaders of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Elsewhere in the interviews, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> asserts that his brother opposed those assassinations. After quitting the Cabinet, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> won election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and in 1968 was pursuing the presidential nomination after <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> decided not to seek re-election. <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> that Sen. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> tried to come to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s bedside just after he was fatally shot, but <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> headed him off. He said <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, around whom dump-Johnson sentiment had first coalesced, told him: `` What we should do now is create a coalition and go back to <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, tell him to run _ and we'll all support him.''

<HEAD>Salvador's Legislature Paralyzed By Vote Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The governing party's presidential candidate on Monday appealed to the rightist opposition to help resolve a crisis that has split the legislature `` There is either going to be consensus or permanent impasse for three years. And the country can not withstand impasse,'' <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON>, nominated at the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' convention on Friday, told a news conference. The crisis stems from a dispute over which party controls one seat in the 60-seat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the unicameral legislature that was elected March 20. The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, claims it won 31 seats during the election and that the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who had previously held a majority, stole a seat through electoral fraud. The Christian Democrats deny the charge. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> has appealed the final vote count for the disputed seat to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but it was uncertain when the court would rule. The rightists maintain that, for the moment, the Assembly has 59 members. The legislature was to have been inaugurated Sunday for a three-year term. The 30 Arena deputies showed up and declared congress in session. But the 30 other deputies _ 23 for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and seven for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ gathered in another room and held their own session. The Christian Democrats claimed the legislature no longer exists because the constitution says that `` half plus one'' of the Assembly's 60 members must be on hand for it to be installed or to act. `` As of today, there is no national legislature,'' <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, said only a majority of the elected deputies is needed to install the congress. He said his party has that majority in a 59-member Assembly. <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON> said he believes the politicians can work things out. `` This kind of confrontation serves no one's purposes except those of the guerrillas, who sit calmly in the mountains watching us destroy each other,'' he said. Leftist rebels have been fighting the U.S.-supported government since 1980. Arena exhibited its growing power with the upset in the legislative elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had 33 seats in the previous <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Leftist guerrillas ordered vehicles to stay off <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s roads for an indefinite period beginning Tuesday The transport ban, the third called this year, was announced Monday on the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos. Previous transport bans were enforced by rebels who burned the vehicles of violators. The rebels said the measure was in response to an increase in repression by the armed forces and police.

 A two-week national strike over gasoline price increases ended Monday after negotiations between government and unions, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. The strikes had paralyzed medical and banking services. After talks with eight union leaders, the government agreed to labor's main demand that four detained union leaders be freed, Labor Minister <PERSON> Aboubacar </PERSON> <PERSON> Umar </PERSON> said in a statement. He made no mention of a second union demand that there be no further gasoline price increases. There was no immediate comment from union leaders, nor were the names of those being released immediately made available. <PERSON> Umar </PERSON> acknowledged that the rising cost of living in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most populous nation with an estimated 100 million people, was a sensitive issue among workers. Student protests began in the north-central city of <PERSON> Jos </PERSON> on April 11, the day after the government increased gasoline prices by 3 percent. Demonstrations turned violent April 13 when thousands of university students and <PERSON> Jos </PERSON> residents clashed with police, with six people killed. The unrest quickly spread to other campuses around <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and labor unions joined the protest in defiance of government threats. The government raised the price of gasoline and diesel fuel in what was expected to be the first of a series of increases. The action followed <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> recommendations to make gasoline prices higher to help reduce <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s $ 1.5 billion budget deficit. Many Nigerians have considered low gasoline prices as their right since the boom days for oil-exporter <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> in the mid-1970s. Even with the increases gas sells for about 40 cents a gallon. The <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nigeria </ORGANIZATION> has reported the government was holding many union officials, including the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> and the assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> and Midwives. Last week the news agency reported the president and secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railwaymen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> were arrested, though rail workers did not join the strike. The news agency said 11 union leaders in <LOCATION> Kano </LOCATION> were released on bail Friday. A judge said they could get three years in prison if convicted of taking part in walkouts. The government dismissed thousands of civil servants in the strikes called April 19 involving banks, government and medical services.

 Leaders of the Nicaraguan Contra rebels met Monday amid signs that their troops are running short of supplies and some field commanders are demanding removal of their military chief. Contra directors polled their top military officers Monday over the fate of Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, confirmed rebel spokesman <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>. `` We are working on obtaining signatures of all the field commanders,'' said <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>. Sources close to the Contras said some of the five directors were expected to demand <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>'s firing at the meeting in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, known as Cmdr. <PERSON> Tono </PERSON>, gave interviews over the weekend saying as many as 30 senior Contra commanders had signed a petition demanding <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>'s ouster. `` <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> has to go,'' <PERSON> Tono </PERSON> said. `` The movement can not continue with him in charge.'' He said <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, a former colonel in the hated National Guard of deposed dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> <PERSON> Debayle </PERSON>, has recently been surrounding himself with other former guardsmen. And <PERSON> Tono </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> of condoning, and possibly participating in, skimming profits from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. The controversy over <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> follows a week of reports that <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> had led an unsuccessful move to fire the military chief, running up against the opposition of fellow director <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>. Sources said <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> has indicated privately that if <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> is fired, he may quit the directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance, as the Contras are formally known. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> is considered the most hard-line of the five directors, and has the closest ties to the field troops. The battle over <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> was not the Contras' only worry, however. Their soldiers' situation has worsened as the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have refused to allow food and non-lethal supplies to reach rebels. The Contras accuse the Sandinistas of reneging on the agreement signed in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, in March that said the aid would be allowed in during negotiations. The Contras issued minutes of that meeting Monday aimed at showing the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to the aid. <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are now demanding concessions in return for the food and supplies. `` They are trying to blackmail us with hunger,'' said <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>. `` It is a difficult situation. The aid must begin immediately.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> offered to have the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> deliver the humanitarian aid. But the Contras insisted they have the right to say who delivers it, and they see <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> as sympathetic to <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement says the rebels may receive aid through a neutral organization once they are in the cease-fire zones. When the rebel leaders returned from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Sunday after the latest round of unsuccessful peace talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> bitterly criticized the handling of the aid issue. `` They are hinging the entire cease-fire agreement on how goods will be delivered instead of on the democratization of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said. `` We had already agreed on how the goods will be delivered, and now they bring it up again.'' The rebel leaders expressed outrage during the talks, saying the government had reneged on promises and created an oppressive atmosphere that jeopardizes future talks in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The next round of talks have been tentativley set for May 12-24, and <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said he hopes they will be held outside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>World Bank Lowers Status of Its Loans to Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has paid nothing to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for six months on the $ 502 million owed to it, the bank announced Monday. As a consequence, the bank's loans to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have been placed in a `` non-accrual status,'' which means the bank will no longer include on its own statements the interest and other charges due from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> until money is actually received. The bank, owned by 151 countries, is the biggest single source of aid money for the Third World. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest shareholder. `` Placing loans in a non-accrual status is an accounting action which does not reduce in any way the country's obligation to the bank or the bank's ability to assist the country in formulating policies to help redress its economic difficulties,'' the announcement said. Last Nov. 30, the bank stopped disbursing loans to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, as it does to any borrowing country whenever payments on earlier loans are more than 75 days overdue. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s financial situation has been deteriorating for almost a year because of the political crisis there, and it's been aggravated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions taken to try to oust strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was indicted earlier this year in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges. The situation became critical Feb. 26, the day <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> engineered the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> for issuing an order firing the general. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has 118 banks, and has been a major Latin American financial center, but the banks have been closed to the public by government order since March 4 because of cash shortages following months-long runs on accounts and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> freeze on Panamanian assets. Some Panamanian and foreign banks reopened April 18 but only to accept deposits.

<TEXT>
 Opposition party leaders met Monday to study reports that strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> made a deal with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to resign. It was the first known meeting between the party leaders in the nearly yearlong crisis. `` We met to discuss jointly the grave situation of our country and what we may do together to find a democratic solution for our country,'' <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting was at his home. Other sources at the session said representatives of six political parties met for more than two hours. One source, speaking with the condition he not be identified, said the leaders discussed `` everything that has to do with the serious crisis,'' including the reported arrangement between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of the 15,000-member Defense Forces. He did not elaborate on the talks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Friday that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had agreed to step down as the military chief but refused to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Panamanian opposition had wanted. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Sunday that talks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> continued during the weekend and that `` progress is being made.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Saturday denied he had made any commitments to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoys. Opposition leaders were alarmed at the report that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might be allowed to remain in the country even if he did resign. They said such a change in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stand would be a `` serious mistake that would not solve <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s problems or bring democratization to the country.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> called the meeting and representatives were sent by the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and factions of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> and Labor parties. The Authentic Panamanian Party is the largest opposition party followed by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was removed by the Noriega-controlled legislature on Feb. 26, the day after he tried to fire the general. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last February on drug-trafficking charges, which he denies. Sources in the opposition said earlier that their leaders were afraid the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was bypassing them and ignoring promises to them. They said if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> quits but remains in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> he would continue to wield power through the Defense Forces. `` He would continue to be a focus of controversy,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said. The opposition also insists that chief executive <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, named to replace <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, not be allowed to remain in office until the May 1989 elections. Demonstrations demanding <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster began last summer after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s former second-in-command publicly accused the general of involvement in political assassinations, electoral fraud and corruption. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on drug charges.

<TEXT>
 Campaigning for the December presidential election began Monday with 72 parties entering the race but only two considered to have a good chance of winning. They are the governing Social Democrats and the Social Christians. The third-ranked <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialism </ORGANIZATION> and smaller parties will seek to assure their survival by picking up congressional seats. In the last presidential election in 1983, the two main parties received 90 percent of the vote. Former President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 67, is the Social Democrats candidate. He served as chief executive from 1974-79. The constitution bars a president from seeking re-election to a second consecutive term. The Social Christian candidate is 47-year-old <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, an energetic campaigner known as The Tiger. In his opening rally in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> he called on the voters to `` say no to the past.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, vice-president of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, began his campaign with rallies in three cities _ <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cabimas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guayana </LOCATION>. During his previous administration the government nationalized the vital oil industry and began to strengthen and expand the iron, aluminum and hydroelectric industries in the Guayana region. But it also was under <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> that the country contracted a big portion of its $ 33 billion debt. President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> has struggled through much of his five-year term with severe economic problems caused mainly by falling oil prices. Government officials say unemployment is running at 10 percent, double the rate of a decade ago. Last year inflation was a record 40.3 percent. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has had elected governments since the fall of dictator Gen. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> in January 1958.

 <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that opposition forces in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> boycotted the official May Day celebrations and said anti-government demonstrators were `` particularly aggressive'' in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. The official Soviet news agency did not mention the Polish labor strife, referring only to `` the current situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' The brief article said official celebrations of May Day had been targeted by anti-government groups. It quoted Polish government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> as saying: `` The calls for boycotts by the opposition forces have been disregarded.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> made no mention of clashes between police and opposition groups, but said 12,000 people took part nationwide in anti-government demonstrations. Opposition spokesman in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> claimed at least 30,000 people joined in the demonstrations. The Soviet news media has been silent about the strikes, the most serious labor problem for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist authorities since the independent Solidarity union was chartered in the fall of 1980. Solidarity, the only free union federation in the Soviet bloc, was suspended in December 1981 and subsequently outlawed by Parliament. The Solidarity underground supports the current strikes and also backed the boycott of government May Day observances. Although the Soviet media has not mentioned the labor unrest, many Soviets have heard about it through foreign radio broadcasts. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted Urban as accusing Western broadcasters of `` total falsification'' of events in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

There was no way that we were going to put together the national agreement and let these people hang out there by themselves,'' <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said. `` Now we can get down to the bigger things,'' he said, adding the only deadline set for finishing national contract talks is `` as soon as we possibly can.'' The four-year <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> pact covers 5,500 workers who will be laid off in the closing of an assembly plant at year's end and 1,000 workers at an engine plant that will remain open. The master <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> pact, which covers all <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> workers who were employed by <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> in the state when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> bought the ailing automaker in August, will give <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers about 88 percent, or $ 57 million, of nearly $ 65 million <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> owed them, said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Northard </PERSON>. He said $ 2.2 million of the $ 57 million already was paid in 1985. The <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> payments, which will average between $ 6,000 and $ 8,000 per worker, will be 100 percent of the money <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> borrowed from workers early in the decade but will not include interest <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> had promised, <PERSON> Northard </PERSON> said. About 9,000 workers, including those employed by 1982 at one time or another between 1982 and 1987, will be eligible for the payments, <PERSON> Northard </PERSON> said. Under the same pact, about 200 <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> workers at a parts depot and 425 laid off from a stamping plant there will receive the same percentage of more than $ 5 million <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> owed them under the master pact. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said the master pact would guarantee laid-off workers six months of supplemental unemployment benefits, which are paid in addition to regular unemployment compensation to provide 95 percent of regular pay. In addition, it makes it easier for workers to retire early and matches pension benefits to those at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and the union are negotiating their national contract along the lines of an industry-pattern contract established last fall at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, but have adapted some elements, including a crucial job-security provision. Talks on <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s contract, which expires Sept. 14, opened April 18. Last week, the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> talks were moved to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> so bargainers for both sides could negotiate all contracts simultaneously. The tentative <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> local pact appears similar to a five-year agreement reached in October covering Jeep plant workers in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Both pacts give the company more flexibility in using workers. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Steagall </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 72 at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, said about 20 percent of the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers will be able to retire early and laid-off <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers will have first crack at any new jobs at the engine plant there. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, president of Local 75 in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, said he also was pleased with the settlements, which will be voted on by next week. `` I feel good about what's happening. I do n't feel good about our plant being terminated in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The 1988 assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> opened Monday and high on the agenda were programs to check the spread of AIDS and an anti-smoking campaign. About 1,200 delegates from <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION>'s 166 member countries will elect a successor to Dr. <PERSON> Halfdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> as director general of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency. Dr. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakajima </PERSON>, 59, a Japanese specialist in pyschopharmacology, was designated for the post last January by the 31-member Executive Board. Confirmation by the assembly, scheduled for Wednesday, is a virtual certainty. <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>, head of the agency since 1973, did not seek a fourth five-year term. Delegates at the two-week assembly will consider a proposed zero-growth, two-year budget of $ 639.9 million. Not included in the budget is funding for <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION>'s Special Program on AIDS, which officials have said would require $ 66 million this year. The number of AIDS cases was officially reported last week as exceeding 88,000, but the actual number is known to be much higher. WHO officials have urged further implemtation of the agency's campaign against smoking as `` the major avoidable cause of ill-health. AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a fatal disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It can be transmitted through sexual contact; transfusions of tainted blood or blood products, or sharing contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child at or before birth.

 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> rebels attacked Moslem settlements in southeastern <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and killed 13 people, military officials said Monday. The slayings raised to 36 the number of deaths blamed on the insurgents in the past week, officials said. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said two villages in the <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tracts </LOCATION> area were raided Sunday night, apparently by the same band of armed rebels. The victims included six women and four children, they said. At least nine people were injured in the attacks. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chakma </ORGANIZATION> tribes, descendants of the <ORGANIZATION> Mongols </ORGANIZATION>, have been seeking an independent homeland since 1974. They say their tribal culture is being overwhelmed by the influx of Moslem settlers from other parts of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. An estimated 4,000 people have died in rebel attacks and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> army actions against the insurgents. An estimated 50,000 tribal members have fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to escape the violence. Military officials said rebels on Sunday attacked <LOCATION> Karmangipuri </LOCATION> village, 2 miles from the Indian border, and killed three women and two children. The rebels fled after soldiers from a nearby camp opened fire, they said. There was no word of injuries to the insurgents. In the second attack, the rebels stormed <LOCATION> Malangipara </LOCATION> village, about 10 miles from the frontier. Eight people, including three women and two children, were killed, the officials said.

 A police sharpshooter killed a gunman holding six people inside a bank on Monday after the man threatened to inject his hostages with blood he said contained the AIDS virus, police said. Police said they got the man drunk so they could get the hostages out safely. The man seized six bank workers during an attempt to rob the branch of <ORGANIZATION> Banorte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massoro </LOCATION>, about 1,875 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. Police surrounded the bank after security guards saw a man threatening a teller with a revolver. Police and a journalist negotiated for eight hours with the robber, who said he escaped from <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> prison and was a carrier of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the fatal disease that destroys the body's immune system. The man, who identified himself only as `` <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON>,'' was shot after he drank several bottles of beer provided by police, said Officer <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazareno </PERSON>. `` We gave him lots of beer to get him drunk.

 Israeli troops supported by helicopter gunships and tanks thrust into southeastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Monday in search of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas, police reported. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said its troops had moved into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The army is combing the security zone because of increasing attempts to infiltrate into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for purposes of murder and hostage-taking,'' an Israeli military communique said. It did not say how long the operation would last or how many troops were involved. The communique was issued by the military in the northern Israeli town of <LOCATION> Metulla </LOCATION>. The army censored other details about the operation. Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 500 to 1,500 Israeli soldiers were dispatched to the border region before the operation began. Lebanese police said reports from the Arkoub region in the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> indicated at least three suspected guerrillas had been seized by the Israelis in the late evening operation. The area is in the western sector of the Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` We have no information yet about the size of the attacking force or the distance it covered in the penetration,'' said a spokesman at <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s police headquarters in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He was not identified in line with police regulations. He declined comment on a report by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that said about 2,000 Israeli troops had crossed into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in search of <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and their strongholds. Last week, Palestinian guerrillas entered northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from southeastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in two different incursions. Five guerrillas and two soldiers were killed in fights with Israeli army patrols. There have been 12 infiltrations or attempted infiltrations since Nov. 25, when a Palestinian guerrilla landed a hang glider near a military base and killed six soldiers before being shot to death. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said recent cross-border raids probably were linked to the five months of anti-Israeli demonstrations in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. An Arab youth died Sunday when he was electrocuted while climbing a utility pole at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wazan </LOCATION>. Hospital officials reported relatives of the victim, <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdulhak </PERSON>, 16, said he was killed when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops ordered him to climb the pole to remove a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag. The army said <PERSON> Abdulhak </PERSON> apparently was trying to hang the flag, which is outlawed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. His death brought the number of Arabs killed since the uprising began Dec. 8 to at least 177. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and Jewish settler also have been slain in the violence. There have been reports of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military buildup since guerrilla incursions last week. The Israeli military censor on Monday prevented journalists in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from reporting details about the buildup. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have blamed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for the cross-border guerrilla attacks on grounds the guerrillas were from the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> that is controlled by Syrian forces. <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was asked about the report of 2,000 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers crossing into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` An operation of that magnitude would have to through the <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> area and we see nothing,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> by telephone from his headquarters in the the Lebanese border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>. `` In the area we see and control we do n't see anything,'' <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> has peacekeeping units in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The police spokesman said the attacking force was supported by militiamen of the Israeli-allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary contingent in control of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Squadrons of Israeli air force jet fighters soared over south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s two major cities of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and Tyre, dropping parachute flares and staging mock divebombing runs on Palestinian refugee camps, the spokesman said. The drone of warplane engines also was heard over <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital. But there have been no reports of bombing sorties. The Israeli military said that last Wednesday, two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> crossed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border and wounded a truck driver before they were trapped in a ravine and slain by an army patrol. No army casualties were reported. An army statement said documents found on the dead guerrillas showed they planned to take hostages to exchange for Arab prisoners in Israeli jails. The day before, three guerrillas crossed the border at the same point and were spotted by an army patrol. The army said the three guerrillas and two soldiers were killed in a gunfight.

 Sir <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>, who has died at the age of 88, was an aristocrat turned communist and a man who claimed records in pastimes ranging from playing golf to crawling under trees. His death on April 25 deprived <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of what The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> on Monday called `` an extraordinary character whose eccentricity was remarkable even by the rarefied standards of the baronetage.'' <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>'s self-composed entry in Who's Who takes up four times as much space in that 1,972-page tome as Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s. It is strewn with superlatives, ranging from oldest surviving member of the 1st Royal Dragoon Guards that fought in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1920-22 to holding `` an amateur record amongst golfers of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in having played on 382 separate courses of <LOCATION> UK </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eire </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>'s pursuits ran from sheep-shearing in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> between 1928 and 1931 to riding bicycles to the top of mountains to exploring old Roman roads. `` Wife and himself are only persons who have crawled under dwarf fir forest for last -LCB- mile of most northerly known section of any Roman road in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, terminating opposite end of <LOCATION> Kirriemuir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Golf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Course </LOCATION>,'' his Who's Who entry revealed. <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> was born in the Tunisian desert on Aug. 8, 1899, the son of big-game hunter Sir <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>. Christened <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhys </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>, he was educated at upper-crust <PERSON> Harrow </PERSON> high school but ran away to work in a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> shipyard, joined the dragoons and became a champion cavalry swordsman. He received a disability discharge after he was shot by a Irish sniper. At 46, he changed his name from <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> to <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON>, one of several such alterations he would make, including the addition of <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> during his Moslem period. He went from Christian to Moslem to <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>. In 1935, he became president of the British <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> but resigned weeks later after a rowdy society meeting. `` They were very rude ... and knew nothing of law and order or methods of procedure,'' he was quoted as saying. From 1944, according to Who's Who, he was `` a practicing Non-Theistic Theravada Buddhist'' who `` performed Holy Buddhist Pilgrimage Nov. 1944, the second Britisher to do so.'' <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> served as an army captain in World War II, but according to the Telegraph regretted fighting for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, saying: `` If a revolution comes _ and come it must after the next world war _ I'll do my damnedest to see it succeeds. In 1950 he was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Perth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> declaring himself `` a blood-red militant communist in every possible way.'' Fifteen years later he claimed to be the only baronet living on social welfare. He said he would take any job `` except being a butler. I hate snobbishness.'' His first wife, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, died in 1945. He is survived by <PERSON> Robina </PERSON>, his second wife. A death notice in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> died in a hospital and was cremated in a private service.

 <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Democrats Monday rallied around <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> following the weekend suicide of his top aide, and Republicans began talking about mounting a stronger challenge for the congressman's seat. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> remained in seclusion Monday following the death of his administrative assistant, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, who plunged 16 stories to his death Sunday from the window of his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> hotel room. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> carried a front-page story the same day quoting former <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> aides as saying the congressman had ceded control of his office to <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, who recruited single, young men as employees and pressured them to socialize with him. Before his death, <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, 46, talked with friends about the article, which quoted staff members as complaining of his unusual demands, including that one unidentified employee perform a striptease at a staff retreat, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. Police said <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> left a poem on hotel stationery. An officer who saw it said the unsigned eight-line verse spoke of the `` dark and ugly world'' and ended with a reference to `` crashing,'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Tuesday's editions. `` Goodbye'' was neatly printed on the sheet, which was lined notebook paper rather than stationery and bore no addressee, the Times said. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Skipper </PERSON>, another aide, were in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to meet with a lawyer and attend the Broadway musical `` Phantom of the Opera,'' police there said. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> and Skipper were interviewed by police Sunday. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s office, which said it did not know the lawmaker's whereabouts, issued a brief statement Monday from <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> expressing sympathy to <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>' friends and family `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> was my friend and political ally for almost two decades,'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said. `` All of us who had the privilege of working with him will miss him more than we can say.'' Democratic officials predicted <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, 39, would win re-election in November, although they said his reaction to <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>' death would be crucial. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> has any trouble. I think <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> is popular'' in his 1st Congressional District, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s Democratic Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, vice chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s standing with the voters `` is good enough that he'll be able to weather this.'' But he cautioned that <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s `` reaction to this is going to be the key.'' Republican leaders said they are thinking of asking <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilchrest </PERSON>, a political novice who won the party's nomination in the March primary, to consider stepping aside so a better-known candidate can challenge <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>. But they said they wo n't try to force out <PERSON> Gilchrest </PERSON>. `` The nomination was won fair and square by <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilchrest </PERSON>, and I think we have to take our lead from him,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Warfield </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said. `` Our role is to explain to him exactly what is involved in being a challenger.'' The -LRB- <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> -RRB- Evening Sun quoted <PERSON> Gilchrest </PERSON> as saying he expects to be asked to quit, but that he does not plan to step aside. Former Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON>, a Republican who lost the seat to <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> in 1980, said <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>' death `` could hurt him -LRB- <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> -RRB-, it could defeat him. But I think it depends on the further revelations about what drove Mr. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> to his suicide.'' `` I would warn the Republican party, my own party, not to make an issue of this,'' <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> lost the seat to <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> in 1980 after <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> was charged with soliciting sex from a 16-year-old male prostitute in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The charge was later dropped although <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> acknowledged he was homosexual and an alcoholic. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> medical examiner's office said an autopsy showed <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>' death was caused by multiple internal and external injuries. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> fell from his 24th-floor room to an eighth-floor ledge. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Borakove </PERSON> said toxicology tests performed over the next week to 10 days would determine whether drugs or alcohol were present in his system. An official classification of his death, which police have called a suicide, will await the test results, she said. The Post article came as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigated allegations <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s campaign disclosure reports concealed $ 6,650 in payments to <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>. Political consultant <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said he talked by phone with <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> about the Post article for 25 minutes Sunday morning. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> he was worried that the article had irreparably damaged his career and had hurt <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s re-election chances, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. `` I told him, ` You've done nothing illegal, you've done nothing immoral and therefore I think you can deal with this,''' <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said, adding he did n't think <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> was particularly depressed.

 As Soviet troops prepare to withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistgan </LOCATION>, the Indian government has ordered a strengthening of its guard along the border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> here in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> took the step out of concern that arms that might no longer be needed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> would find their way to Sikh militants fighting to secede from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and form a nation of their own. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is on the other side of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> from here. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of facilitating what it calls `` narco-terrorism,'' by which the Sikh militants buy arms with money from heroin smuggling. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denies the allegation. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ordered 3,000 more men to police the border in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, raising the frontier force to 18,000. He also directed the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state government to begin building a barbed-wire fence along the frontier. But some border-guard officials doubt this can stop all illegal traffic. `` Sealing the border is not like licking and sealing an envelope,'' said <PERSON> Jasmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a senior officer in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is impossible to completely stop trans-border movement.'' The <LOCATION> Punjab-Pakistan </LOCATION> border is 340 miles long. Smuggling has long been prevalent in the region. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s lower-priced gold and textiles, for example, find eager markets in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> In recent years, the smugglers have added narcotics and automatic rifles. Sikh militants, allegedly involved as both smugglers and buyers, need the arms to sustain their six-year guerrilla campaign for a Sikh homeland. So far this year, they have killed more than 800 people. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> police say most of the killings have been carried out with Chinese-made AK-47 rifles diverted from the Afghan rebels. Since last early this year, the Sikh extremists have added rocket-propelled grenades and shoulder-fired, anti-aircraft missiles to their arsenal. President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has denied giving aid or support to the Sikh militants. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> nonetheless still maintains that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> both harbors the extremists and even provides cover fire when they make border crossings. The area's rugged terrain makes the frontier difficult to seal. In some places, as here in <LOCATION> Dhinda </LOCATION> on the northern-most tip of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, farmers on both sides cultivate land right up to the border, which often is marked only by a short white pillar. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, the border security officer, said: `` How can we stop two farmers sharing a hookah -LRB- pipe -RRB- and exchanging packets?'' In other border areas, six-foot elephant grass makes clandestine movement easy. At some places, river valleys and shifting tributaries make it difficult to even determine where the border is. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s policing efforts include observation towers a little over a mile apart. Patrols stay within 500 yards of each other and after dark, border troops use night-vision binoculars and searchlights. But the searchlights sometimes lose electric power, said <PERSON> Chaman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lal </PERSON>, a deputy-inspector general in the border force. `` We suspect it is arranged,'' he added. He said the government should provide separate power lines for the searchlights instead of relying on connections from border villages. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalha </PERSON>, the district commissioner at <LOCATION> Gurdaspur </LOCATION>, one of three <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> districts bordering <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, talked of even more elaborate projects in store to seal the border. `` The government plans to ban cultivation up to 500 meters -LRB- 1,640 feet -RRB- from the border and create a no mans land,'' he said. `` Later, this area will be fenced off and mined.'' Even if security measures succeed in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, smugglers have alternative routes to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jasmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> noted that the border in <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> state to the south cuts through hard-to-patrol swamps, while in neighboring <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> state it passes through desert. `` They can bring arms through <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION>, where observation posts are set at least eight kilometers -LRB- about five miles -RRB- apart,'' he said. `` All they need is a fast camel. And they have faster camels than we have.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is assigning various types of its more modern warships to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to put them to the test in a combat environment. While the Oliver Hazard Perry-class guided missile frigates, small vessels known as `` figs,'' will continue to dominate the Gulf-based <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has assigned three of its modern Spruance-class destroyers to the waterway, and for the first time in at least a year will have no guided missile cruisers on hand. The cruisers, none of them less than 20 years old, have shared the brunt of Gulf escort and patrol duties with the frigates in the past year. The emphasis now is to be on more modern ships, primarily the destroyers, which one officer said `` will be the backbone of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in coming years.'' Assigning these and other types of ships to the Gulf will give some `` balance'' to the overall surface fleet, rather than having the combat experience concentrated in mostly older vessels, said the officer, speaking only on condition of anonymity. At the time the guided missile frigate Stark was hit and nearly sunk by an Iraqi missile May 17, 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had four to six members. It more than doubled, then tripled, after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began escorting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in July to protect them from Iranian attack. More than 50 of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s 230-plus surface combat ships have made their appearance in the Gulf since then. Although it varies from week to week as ships arrive and depart, the Gulf-based force recently stood officially at 16, including six wooden-hulled ocean-going minesweepers, more than 30 years old, and their mother ship, the <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>. Several of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s 31 Spruance-class destroyers, 7,810-ton ships armed with a variety of long-range missiles, have served with carrier battle groups supporting the Gulf convoy operations from the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, but none have been in the Gulf until recently. One reason, officers say, is that their long-range missiles and defensive weapons were not suitable for the confines of the Gulf, where close-in missile attacks and armed speedboats are considered the major threats. The same was true of the older Adams-class destroyers, which were regulars in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION> for many years until the Stark incident. Those ships, built in the 1950s and 1960s, are among the last of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s World War II-style vessels, although with aluminum superstructures. None of these ships carry the computerized gatling gun, called `` sea whiz,'' designed to knock down incoming cruise missiles with storms of spent-uranium shells. All other ships in the Gulf have been equipped with the rapid-firing `` terminal defense'' and other improvised defenses. Recent arrivals were the Spruance-class destroyers O ` <PERSON> Brien </PERSON> and <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> and the 25-year-old guided missile destroyer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>. They are being followed into the Gulf by at least one other Spruance-class ship, the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>. The recent arrivals saw action during the April 18 clashes with Iranian naval forces. The <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> fired a Harpoon missile that scored a direct hit on one of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s frigates and itself came under fire from Iranian missiles. Since the Stark, 22 of its sister Perry-class ships have been to the Gulf and four more will soon do their 2 -LCB- - month turns in the waterway In addition to the `` figs,'' the list includes 10 of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s 17 1960s-vintage missile cruisers, two of its seven helicopter assault carriers of the same era, and a variety of amphbious landing ships No large aircraft carriers, battleships, state-of-the art `` aegis'' cruisers or nuclear-powered warships have operated in the Gulf. When they entered service in the late 1970s, the boxy-looking, 3,700-ton Perry-class frigates were much criticized as inadequate for their intended role, which was providing anti-submarine protection for battle groups. But in the Gulf, the `` figs'' have carried the brunt of the escort duty, and the punishment. One frigate, the <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, set a tedium-endurance record with more than a dozen `` transits'' during its two-month duty tour. Another, the <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, hit a mine April 14 but survived through the heroic efforts of its crew. Cmdr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, skipper of the frigate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, says the ships have proved in the Gulf that they can handle almost any situation. `` As late as 1980, admirals were still saying the FFGs did n't belong in the fleet,'' said <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` Now we know _ they can steam, they can deliver, they have sustainability. Another officer, asking not to be named, said there was no doubt that the frigates have been ideally suited for the Gulf assignment. `` But there's also a need to give other types of ships and their crews the same chance for training under those conditions,'' he said. The Pentagon announced the rotation of ships at an April 22 news briefing, in an effort to forestall speculation that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was enlarging its Gulf-based force following the one-day series of armed clashes with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on April 18.

<HEAD>Top 20 May Not Be Good Enough for `Molly'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Is n't it just like that <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, TV's perplexed and perplexing, quintessential struggling single woman, to scramble <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s neat little line of comedies that always rank 1, 2, 3, 4 in the Nielsens Last week, the network's four Thursday comedies _ `` The Cosby Show,'' `` A Different World,'' and `` Cheers,'' with `` The Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'' bringing up the rear _ ranked 1, 2, 3, 13. Yes, that's our Molly, throwing a monkey wrench into the smooth-running <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> comedy machine. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> put `` <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'' into the `` Night Court'' slot in March. `` Night Court'' was Top 10. <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> drops to the top 20, not good enough for No. 1 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. People who fall down laughing at the ta-ta-DUM one-liners of `` Cheers'' apparently do n't adjust easily to the offbeat, jazzy rhythms of tragi-comic half-hour that follows and they are tuning out. Besides that, the show has run in odd 13-week spurts in the spring when prime time becomes a hodge-podge of repeats and short-run series. After the show completed its successful run last season, there was no room for it in hit-heavy <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s fall schedule. Many fans presumed it had been canceled. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Brush </PERSON>, who writes the show with executive producer <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON>, complains that even after all the critical praise last season, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> gave the series little fanfare when it returned. `` I'm thrilled with the show. I'm happy it's on the air and people are seeing it. I would just like to see people get a chance to get used to it and know that it's not like the other shows they're watching,'' <PERSON> Brush </PERSON> said. The show is dear the hearts of Brush and <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON>. It is the first television experience for Brush, 40, formerly a Broadway composer -LRB- `` The First'' -RRB-. His wife, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Faison </PERSON>, who now plays <PERSON> Molly </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Mamie </PERSON>, had gone to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> for auditions, so Brush went along, packing a script he'd written. It caught the attention of an agent who introduced Brush to <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON>. The two, said <PERSON> Brush </PERSON>, had a `` psychic sympathy.'' It was <PERSON> Brush </PERSON> who wrote this season's episode in which <PERSON> Molly </PERSON>'s father died, and it was profound, touching, poetic television Entertaining her boss, <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, in her apartment, <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> chatted happily as she went into the bathroom to get something. There, for a split second, she saw the image of her father in a mirror. When she turned, it was gone. Then the phone rang. Cut to <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, droning on about whether or not his stew is adequately jelling, when he finally realizes <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> is n't there. He goes into the deserted living room where the phone is beeping, off the hook. It is these poignant scenes that seem to confound audiences used to solid yocks in half-hour television shows. To deal with the new concept of 30-minute dramas with comedy, TV writers coined the term `` dramedy,'' which the writers and producers of such shows detest as unnecessary pigeon-holing. If `` Molly'' is n't a `` dramedy,'' what does Brush say it is? `` I say that we're writing a character piece, that we're really trying to write about a real person, we're trying to write a show about the human comedy. which is not about jokes, not about wordplay, but has to do with getting to know a person who is not unlike almost everybody.'' Acknowledging that's a mouthful, he adds, `` OK, so it's ` dramedy.' But seriously. `` I think one of the confusions that has happened is viewers tend to say, ` How come I do n't like <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> more?' I think that's because we're not out to say, look, we want to present you someone you'll like We're saying we want to present you someone you may recognize yourself in.'' Brush is writer-producer on <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON>' other show for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` The ` Slap' Maxwell Story.'' It did n't do well in the ratings, and its renewal is up for grabs, too. On top of that, star <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> wants to quit shooting the series one-camera like a movie and go to a three-camera sitcom style. `` He has a vision of it which does not really square with my vision of the show,'' said <PERSON> Brush </PERSON>, who opposes any moves to make the complex Slap more likable. `` I think what worked in the show when it worked was the fact that he could seem on one hand to be so callous and miserable, but then what we could learn about was that there was a real sympathetic machine working underneath,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> D'Oyly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> has been revived and is once again ready for the road with the rollicking songs of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> that made it famous a century ago. The company went out singing on Feb. 27, 1982, with a performance of `` H.M.S. Pinafore'' at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Adelphi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridget </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Oyly </PERSON> <PERSON> Carte </PERSON>, the founder's granddaughter, was in that audience. She died in 1985 and her will left the bulk of her $ 7.8 million estate to trustees who had run the company until its demise. The new company in the northeast town of <LOCATION> Sunderland </LOCATION> opened a 10-day run of `` Iolanthe'' and `` The Yeomen of the Guard'' on April 28. The <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> operas, an art form as distinctly English as bowler hats and tea and crumpets, remain hugely popular throughout the world. Productions of such hits as `` The Mikado,'' `` The Pirates of Penzance'' and `` H.M.S. Pinafore'' regularly appear on stages from elementary schools to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. `` We are riding the crest of a wave,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, the company's general manager. `` If you look around the West End -LRB- of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -RRB-, audiences are going for entertaining musicals and we are going for a lively style.'' A three-month tour through seven other cities in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> follows the <LOCATION> Sunderland </LOCATION> premiere, and the company also hopes to book a run in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` We are already talking about taking the company to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said. `` Inquiries began coming in from agents as soon as we announced on March 1 that we were back.'' The <ORGANIZATION> D'Oyly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> thrived for 107 years on the works of librettist Sir <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwenck </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and composer Sir <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who collaborated on 14 operettas over 25 years. The style was burlesque, poking satirical fun at politics, the law and society with outrageous puns and far-fetched rhymes. Some Gilbertian phrases entered everyday speech, such as `` things are seldom what they seem,'' `` the upper crust,'' `` a policeman's lot is not a happy one,'' `` language that would make your hair curl'' and `` blow your own trumpet.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Oyly </PERSON> <PERSON> Carte </PERSON> founded the company in 1875 to stage the operettas and built the Savoy Hotel and the neighboring Savoy Theater from the proceeds. Royalties flowed in from thousands more productions abroad, but there was widespread pirating. In 1879 alone more than 150 unauthorized productions of `` H.M.S. Pinafore'' played in 60 cities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> who edits The W.S. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Journal </PERSON> for <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> fans worldwide. D'Oyly Carte hit back by staging his own `` H.M.S. Pinafore'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1879, and in 1880 he had five companies touring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said the new 103-member company plans two operas a year and has new costumes, new sets, a chorus of 32 and an orchestra of 33. <PERSON> Bramwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovey </PERSON>, the company's music director and formerly music director of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION>, has re-examined the surviving operetta scores and revived long-forgotten notations and directions. `` For years, the old company clung to one directional format and maybe that led to its running out of steam,'' said <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>. `` Also, as copyright on each work expired after 100 years, the fall in royalties coincided with rocketing costs.'' The original company lost $ 446,500 in 1981 and had to cancel a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour. The government-funded Arts Council refused an appeal for help, pronouncing the D'Oyly Carte style `` wooden and tired.'' <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said $ 945,000 was budgeted for the new `` Iolanthe'' and `` Yeomen.''

 <PERSON> Abdala </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>, a fiery populist leader from this rough-and-tumble port, is given a chance of winning <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s presidency even though the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, newspapers and others object to his raucous style and language. The prospect that <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>, leader of the populist <ORGANIZATION> Roldosista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, could win the presidential runoff election Sunday has stirred rumors of a military coup and sent tremors through <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s financial circles. The military sent him fleeing into exile once before. His foes accuse him of appealing to class hatred in his speeches. But <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>'s response is that he is a champion of the poor. Campaigning recently in <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION>'s steamy heat with his shirt tail hanging out, he called himself a `` good-hearted slob'' and admits he may be a bit `` crazy.'' But his opponent in the election, <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, is taking <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>'s challenge seriously. Political analysts say <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> has a good chance of defeating <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, a Social Democrat and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, in the runoff. In the first round Jan. 31, the 36-year-old <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> won second place in a field of 10 candidates with 15.3 percent of the vote to 20.3 percent for the 52-year-old <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, 52. The winner Sunday will replace <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, a staunchly conservative, pro-U.S. political leader whose four-year term ends in August. This nation of 10 million people, wedged between <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, has suffered in recent years from severe economic problems and political instability sparked in great part by bitter disputes between <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> and left-leaning parties that control <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, who narrowly lost to <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> in a runoff in 1984, has pledged to reverse the current government's free-market economic policies and seek close ties with the Non-Aligned Movement, also known as the Third World. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s party is <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s largest, but his chances are weakened, many analysts say, because he is viewed as a lackluster speaker without strong leadership ability. <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>, who wears a Hitler-style mustache and says he is an admirer of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leader's `` organizational genius,'' charged at one point in the campaign that `` an international Jewish conspiracy'' was against him. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders and newspapers have assailed <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> for his use of gutter-language in attacks on <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> has called <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> a drunkard and drug addict in television interviews. He also has used unprintable street language to question his foe's virility. `` <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> lacks strength, spirit,'' <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> said. `` He's a lukewarm man. <PERSON> Abdala </PERSON> is different,'' he said of himself. `` He awakens passions. There is no middle ground with him.'' The attacks have prompted <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, a calm, urbane lawyer, to respond in kind, calling <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> an `` irresponsible clown'' and a `` fascist ignoramus.'' `` I have been accused of everything in my political career from narcotics trafficker to thief,'' <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> said in a midnight interview outside his small third-floor walkup apartment on a garbage-littered downtown street. <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> has pledged to `` punish the oligarchy'' and crack down on wealthy tax evaders who, he charges, cheat the government of up to $ 500 million a year. `` A vote for me is the same as scratching a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> with a bottle cap,'' he told a cheering slum crowd, alluding to such an act as defiance of the rich. He has promised a `` shoe bank'' to provide free shoes for all poor children and has pledged to nearly double the monthly minimum wage to $ 60. His foes call him a demagogue for making such promises but acknowledge privately that <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> is following in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s tradition of populist leaders The late <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON> won the presidency five times, in good measure because of his inflammatory populist rhetoric. He also was ousted four times in military coups. <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> was mayor of this city of 1.5 million people when he fled into exile in late 1985 to escape prison on a charge of slandering the armed forces, a criminal offense in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. He had said all the military was good for was wasting money on parades. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> he was arrested on a charge of possessing five pounds of cocaine. He claimed it was a frame-up arranged by <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, a political enemy. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> granted him amnesty on the military offense and pressured <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> into dropping the cocaine charge. He returned in August 1987 to a hero's welcome from his followers in <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION>'s shantytowns. <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> is heir to a political dynasty of <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> immigrants who settled in <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s biggest city and its commercial hub. His sister, <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON>, was elected mayor of <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION> in the general elections this past January. Even political foes say <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> was successful in administering <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION>, a tough port city that has proved unmanageable for many mayors. He won over hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers by paving streets, piping in drinking water and providing other essential services. He cracked down on street crime and kept the city clean by jailing anyone who let garbage pile up in front of his property.

<HEAD>China's Industrial Boom Threatens Rural Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Along with a new prosperity, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s industrial boom of the past decade has filled rural skies with smog, poisoned wells and blackened streams. The mushroom-like growth of small rural factories that burn coal and lack money or know-how to clean up their wastes has made environmental pollution a nationwide problem. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership, which long claimed that only profit-driven capitalist industries polluted the environment, has begun to construct an environmental protection system. The first environmental protection law was passed in 1979. Several others setting standards for air and water purity have been approved since then. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> was created in 1984, replacing a lower-level committee on the environment. But the chemists, technicians and enforcers in the new system are stretched thinly across the vast rural interior. The estimated 20,000 workers, most without college degrees and with a minimum of special training, have the power, on paper at least, to shut down factories, impose heavy fines, move industries from harmful locations and deny permission for construction of new ones. In reality, however, they often must compromise when strict enforcement of standards could mean shutting down a town's main taxpayer, or when the money to build treatment facilities is lacking. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, with 100 staffers, mainly analyzes pollution data, leaving local agencies to do the enforcing. `` We want to maintain the beauty of mountains and rivers,'' said <PERSON> Tang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shidi </PERSON>, head of the environmental office in <LOCATION> Panzhihua </LOCATION>, a small steel town surrounded by thickly forested mountains in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province. `` But on the other hand we have to support economic development.'' He told a visitor to his office that he makes recommendations to local authorities when a new factory or office is built, but acknowledged they were not always followed. `` We have a principle to give active support -LRB- to development -RRB-... and distribute industry rationally,'' said <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuncheng </PERSON>, a deputy department chief at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> But he acknowledged, `` Factories that provide most of the finances for localities and cause serious pollution problems are difficult to deal with.'' Encouraging rural industry has been a key element of the government's post-1978 development drive. Small local factories, now numbering 15 million, have raised rural incomes and absorbed the surplus rural labor force. These factories now account for more than a quarter of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s industrial output, which has more than tripled in the past decade to $ 372 billion <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said 40 percent of rural factories have pollution problems, including 10 percent with `` serious'' problems. Most could be resolved fairly easily if funds were available, he said. Government funds, however, fall far short of the need and are unlikely to increase at a time when farmers, teachers and the army all are clamoring for more money from a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> already in the red. According to the national agency, the state and industry spent $ 1.35 billion last year to fight pollution. Officials estimated it would take three times that just to clean up <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, a major city. Most of the money was spent in cities, which are among the most smog-ridden in the world. The official statistics on pollutants are daunting. Only one fourth of the 36 billion tons of waste water discharged from factories each year is treated. Few factory smokestacks have scrubbers to keep pollutants from rising into the air. <PERSON> Tang </PERSON> said that until a few years ago the <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that supplies <LOCATION> Panzhihua </LOCATION>'s drinking water ran black because a coking plant dumped water laden with coal dust into the river. Now, he said, the waste water is filtered, but the river still is threatened by discharges from a paper mill. The official media have reported other examples. In April, two villagers in rural <LOCATION> Shaanxi </LOCATION> province in north <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> drowned in industrial waste when the dam burst in a reservoir holding toxic chemicals from a mineral processing facility. Wells in the arid region were poisoned, destroying the local residents' water supply for perhaps years to come Ninety percent of a 14,825-acre pine forest in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> was destroyed by acid rain from nearby sulfur processing plants. Rural pollution also spills over from cities. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said more than 200,000 acres of farmland are buried under 7.5 billion tons of industrial waste from city plants.

 In the late 1940s, construction of an underpass in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> effectively sealed off <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>'s novelty shop from the outside _ and buying _ world. To keep on eating, he broke the blockade by placing an ad in House & amp; Garden offering tubes of whiskey-flavored toothpaste. He sold 100,000 before the year was out. A bottle opener in the shape of dentures sold even better. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> had rediscovered a sales tool as ancient as the Babylonians: direct mail. Instead of waiting for the customers to come to you, go to them. Some 6,000 to 10,000 catalog retailers _ the figure varies _ do just that, 11.8 billion catalogs a year, according to trade groups. They range from titans such as L.L. Bean in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to Lands' End in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> anywhere to <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Selman </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> who sells glass paperweights from a $ 15 catalog including a toadstool-shaped antique you can have for $ 27,000. The average American home gets 50 catalogs a year. A burdened letter carrier delivered 324 catalogs to this writer between last Labor Day and Thanksgiving. Last year 88 million Americans _ 51.2 percent of the adult population _ bought something by phone or mail. Direct mail has had a 15 percent annual growth -LRB- 30 percent for upscale catalogs -RRB- since 1970, compared to 5-10 percent for store sales. This is 8.3 percent of the nation's general merchandise sales. Direct mail is a high-tech, almost scientific, business which undoubtedly has the brains to overcome April's 30 percent third class postal hike by becoming even more so. Little of this would have been possible without the computer, the credit card and the 800-prefix telephone number. And above all, the mailing list. The mailing list stems from four of the more mundane items on this part of the planet: the phone book, census reports, ZIP codes and your car registration. Mailing list compilers can get more info from these bare numbers and names than a Biblical exegete could from the Dead Sea Scrolls. <ORGANIZATION> Donnelley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION>, one of the big compilers, says it has more doctors of philosophy interpreting the data than the neighboring <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> hospital has doctors of medicine. Babylonian catalogs came on cuneiformed clay tablets. After <PERSON> Gutenberg </PERSON> invented movable type, <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manutius </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> had a catalog of books he published of Greek and Latin authors. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> _ who else? _ put out a catalog of 600 books in 1744. American colonials bought everything from lace cuffs to musket balls by mail from the Mother Country. But <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> is the direct father of today's direct mail. His 1872 catalog promised farmers savings of up to 40 percent by eliminating the middleman for items ranging from harnesses to parasols. The first compiler was not far behind. He probably was <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, clerk of <LOCATION> Story </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, who discerned that the registrees of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s new tin lizzies were not only farmers but the wealthier of the breed. Such names might mean money. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> got rights to the names and opened the M and <ORGANIZATION> F </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mailing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> with his brother-in-law. <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON>, another visionary, bought them out in 1917. This vision comes true daily at <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON>'s computer operation in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. There the names and addresses from the nation's 2,700 telephone books are `` laboriously converted to computer language,'' says <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON>'s director of marketing services An average directory takes six weeks to computerize. But what's in a name? Not a whole lot until those computers start comparing notes with other computers. Census data, for instance, tell how many people live at a phone address. It gives particulars on value of home, income. The name begins to take on some flesh. Compare those results with motor vehicle registrations, compiled by the R.L. <ORGANIZATION> Polk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Taylor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Two cars at the same address Maybe mom works. An RV? Somebody goes camping. Station wagon? Kids. Sports car? A carefree young in heart if not in fact, a spender. Add some input from ZIP. Admittedly these can be misleading, says <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Heely </PERSON>, a mailing list executive at <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, N.Y. The same ZIP code in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> contains the wealthy living in high-rises along the lakefront and the decidedly unwealthy only a few blocks inland. `` ZIPs are not homogeneous,'' says <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisshahar </PERSON> at <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON>'s computer facility in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. So some firms like <ORGANIZATION> Claritas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> dissect who lives where within a ZIP and divides the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into 250,000 neighborhoods. `` When I got out of college, I moved into an apartment with orange-crate furniture and tacked posters on the wall for decor,'' says <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Claritas </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've moved up and away, but the new tenant probably still has orange crates and tacked posters. Birds of a feather flock together.'' All the easier, then, to identify the flock. This computerized database from national sources _ about half the states will sell vehicle registration lists _ is then inspected, rejected and detected as closely as a 280-pound woman discus thrower from behind the Iron Curtain. Almost everybody buys mailing lists from everybody else to try to find out who <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> are behind the door at 000 Main Street, <LOCATION> Centerville </LOCATION> and just what it is they want to buy. Do they subscribe to The New Yorker? Upscale. Money magazine? Strong evidence of loose change. National Geographic? Travelers, armchair or actual. Field & amp; Stream? And live in rural <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>? And own a camper? <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> are going to hear from <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Orvis </PERSON>. If they buy a sleeping bag and a fly rod, L.L. Bean and <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> wo n't be far behind. Word in direct mail, through list renting, moves fast. `` It's mind-boggling how many sources of data there are,'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> says. Credit card applications. Mortgage loans. Alumni directories. Charitable donations. Building permits. Voting lists. Computers cross-reference all this to draw a profile.

 Many hospitals sell lists of new mothers. That's grist for the baby catalogs. And, in time, grist for kitchen appliances, toys, back-to-school wear, home computers, brides and eventually _ particularly if the addressee has had the same phone for 30 years _ empty nest catalogs. To keep all this straight, lists are continually subjected to merge-purge, eliminating duplications, merging the newly born and purging the newly departed, since even direct mail can not reach beyond the grave. <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steaks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, say, will take a hint from this list, one from another and make a very educated guess as to who's entertaining a lot, having first, of course, cross-checked with the vegetarian list Maybe it will be a <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> owner in an upscale ZIP code with a bouncing new mortgage on a showplace address who subscribes to Gourmet and Gentleman's Quarterly and recently bought a crystal table set from <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s by mail. `` When a customer makes his first purchase, we generally do n't make money,'' says <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> `` But if we give him good service and a good product, he becomes a member of our family. It's a process of time.'' `` You test, test, test,'' says <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>. `` If you use a tool list for golfers, you'll lose your shirt. You use a lot of little sample mailings. You do n't go for broke on one mailing or you will. `` The thing about direct mail is that it is measurable. You spend X dollars for a mailing, and you get Y back. In face-to-face retailing you can make a lot of mistakes before they catch up to you.'' To help avoid database generalities, <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON> periodically sends out questionnaires to the public with free coupons to entice a return. More food for the computer. Success in direct mail is not assured. Reasons for failure are emphatic. `` If you rent 20 lists and 19 bomb, you know you sent your catalog at the wrong time, or it was lousy,'' Heely says. It wo n't be because you rented duds. For reasons related to the Golden Rule, list renters do n't trade off lemons. A list of heavy buyers means higher fees to the renters. The more people buy, the more their habits, desires and depth of pocket becomes known and targeted by more catalogs. To the ever-growing number of two-earner families, this means broader chances for convenience shopping. No traffic jams on the way to the mall or parking hassles once there. No tugs-of-war at bargain counters. No sassy or dumb clerks. Instead, the catalog house has a friendly, knowledgeable voice at the end of an 800 number to answer any problem and assure the customer he or she is n't buying a blind pig in a blind poke. `` It's a lot less expensive to keep the customer happy than to try to find a new one,'' says <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Caugherty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a trade group This is no more than <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> guaranteed when he assured his customers, `` who live remote, by sending their orders and money to the said <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, may depend on the same justice as if present.'' A catalog buy is an act of faith based on a picture of something seen but never touched. Buyer satisfaction is deferred. `` If you do n't receive the goods promptly, the perceived need for it goes away, and the emotional reward goes away, too,'' says <PERSON> Jo-Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> catalog consultant. So one of the first commandments of direct mail is thou shalt fill orders promptly if not sooner. Years ago, entry into direct mail was almost as easy as licking a stamp. <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, a 24-year-old housewife, scraped up $ 2,000 in the early 1920s, placed $ 495 worth of ads for matching purses and belts and offered to monogram them free. <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> did $ 115 million in sales last year. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thalheimer </PERSON> started up his Sharper Image catalog by writing clever copy and offering oddball items such as a suit of 15th century armor for $ 2,450. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Comer </PERSON>, a former ad copywriter, started Lands' End as a yacht supplier, then tacked downwind to become one of the biggest clothing mailers. <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steaks </ORGANIZATION> was a local food supplier until 1952 when <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s father heeded friends' requests to mail meats to their friends. The stampede was on. Mom and Pop still might, just conceivably, start a catalog today over the kitchen table. `` But they better have $ 500,000 up front and be able to sweat it out for two years,'' says <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Heely </PERSON>. `` It's a very crowded mail box,'' says <PERSON> Jo-Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. She helped <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, an Irish tobacco company, spend over $ 5 million with the help of marketing psychologists and all the sci-fi of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> to prepare their recent debut into direct mail with an up-up-scale catalog full of enticing photos of wares to equip your own Buckingham Palace by. `` The day of the dinosaur catalogs like <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s -LRB- recently abandoned -RRB- are over,'' she says `` Catalogs today are aimed at lifestyles.'' `` Mass marketing is dead,'' pronounced <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>. `` Now it's databased Magazines have a lot of wasted circulation. TV is too broad.'' This is both an opportunity and a challenge for the mailing list. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steaks </ORGANIZATION> aims at a broad market of buyers of high quality -LRB- average catalog purchases are somewhere between $ 35 and $ 50 -RRB-. A paperweight catalog has a far narrower focus. <ORGANIZATION> Claritas </ORGANIZATION> helps by breaking down ZIP codes into categories. It tells you where to find such socio-economic groupies they identify as: Money and Brains, Furs and Station Wagons, Pools and Patios, Young Influentials, Towns and Gowns -LRB- academics in non-metropolitan areas -RRB-, God's Country -LRB- well-educated frontier types -RRB-, <LOCATION> Coalburg </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Corntown </PERSON> -LRB- `` Terre Haute and <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> surrounded by rich farmland and peopled by solid, blue-collar citizens raising sturdy <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyerish </PERSON> children in decent front porch houses'' -RRB-. They'll also tell you, for a price, where to find Shotguns and Pickups, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae-villes </PERSON> and Tobacco Roads. At the brush of a computer button Heely brings up data on Woodworkers Supply of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>: 62,833 catalog purchases in the last six months, 173,930 for 1987. An average list, rented for one time use with the owner's veto over content, goes for around $ 80 per thousand names. Throw in another $ 10 if you want a breakdown as to gender a `` recency'' of purchase. Of that the broker, who mediates between landlord and rentee, gets about 20 percent, the manager who has been handling the list, gets 10, the renter pays maybe $ 3.50 to run off his list. The rest is gravy in his pocket.

 Lists and listers pinpoint like a B-1 bombsight. They can tell you that there is a correlation between someone with a propensity for elective surgery and the amount of cash and spare time the cutee has. Computer modeling, applying a myriad of demographic and lifestyle overlays on the primary database, are producing what Ms. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> calls `` a young science.'' It has to be to marry the tastes of an endlessly varied buyer and an endlessly fanciful seller. Where but in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> otherwise sell 6,000 busts of King <PERSON> Tut </PERSON>? How else could you find buyers mailing and phoning for every kind of fitness machine, stereo woofer, subliminal Weight Control tapes, two-ounce bottles of quail scent to train <PERSON> Bowser </PERSON> to the hunt, a 24-room purple martin house with guard rails for baby birds -LRB- $ 289 -RRB-, videotaped tours of <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> games in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> or Civil War battlefields, $ 29.95 music box dolls that play `` Thank Heaven for Little Girls,'' a real steam launch for $ 61,500, 42-inch-high stuffed leather rhinosceri -LRB- $ 495 plus $ 12.95 shipping -RRB-, fur coats, mutual funds? Who are these customers who hold 600 million credit cards and once flooded L.L. Bean with 100,000 phone calls in a day? And what are the catalogs that impel them to lick stamps and dial phones? `` It is the merchandiser's dream to identify the core group of 20 percent who buy 60 percent of the nation's goods,'' says <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>. The 20 percent is not always whom you might expect. Catalog buyers are not sit-by-the-fire-thumbing-a-catalog couch potatoes. More likely they are working couples with limited time to shop. They are yuppies, but also over-50s, who have some discretionary income now the kids have gone. The upscale could well be semi-rurals who are 1,500 miles from <PERSON> Nieman </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>. L.L. Bean's primary constituency is suburban Rural folk can buy lumber jackets and gas lanterns down at the general store. The market is, potentially, anyone who can dial a phone. In 1967, 653 businesses had 800 numbers and handled 7 million phone calls. Today there are 535,000 toll-free numbers, 6.3 billion calls to them and even an 800 number for information on 800 numbers. Today's catalog is only a distant relative to yesteryear's <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> version that was a backhouse fixture. Banana Republic's is a safari through suburban <PERSON> bush </PERSON> clothing together with a written one from some exotic trek. <LOCATION> Patagonia </LOCATION> has rock climbers and sky divers scrambling over the pages of its sportswear, implying that here is the garb of real he-persons. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>'s handsome tool catalog elevates photos of hammers, saws and wooden planes almost to fine art. `` Catalogs are first and foremost a photographer's medium,'' says <PERSON> Jo-Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. `` But it has to be more than a pretty picture. It has to have a tone and personality, not just ticky-tacky boxes.'' `` The creative part gets more attention, but it's only 20 percent of success,'' says Chambers. `` The rule of thumb is that 40 percent is the right product and 40 percent is the targeting.'' Bean's no-nonsense pictures, town-meeting typeface and laconic cracker-barrel prose combine to say `` granite solid value.'' Some tool wholesalers, on the other hand, intentionally print on poor paper with indifferent illustrations so the home hobbyist thinks he is getting bargains straight from the close-out sale. The fact that there are 51 million videocassette recorders in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is not lost on the catalog industry. Country Curtains will provide a cassette so you can see right on your own TV set what their products will do for your windows. Selling by VCR is an idea whose time has only just begun. Computerized shopping by TV has long been said to be right around a corner that never seems to arrive. <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>, however, has just launched an electronic catalog in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburbs which enables the viewer to scan, linger over and buy illustrated items from some 50 suppliers, including a supermarket. All you have to do is turn on the cable catalog channel and manipulate it with a Touch Tone phone. The system will even play selections from records you might want to buy. For the retailer who wants to know what is selling, which is the name of the game in the game of names, <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s system, called Telaction, `` can tell if people looked at the blue shoes as well as the black they bought or how long someone looked at a dress even if she did n't buy it,'' says <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Telaction </LOCATION>. The cost of finding a customer via catalog is rising with the cost of technology, the cost of paper, the cost of mailing. <ORGANIZATION> DMA </ORGANIZATION>, whose more than 2,000 members have just been hit with the postal hike, is looking into alternative delivery systems. The industry is not happy with a joint survey by <ORGANIZATION> DMA </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON>, the publisher, that the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> failed to deliver four to 14.1 per cent of third class mail in 1983 and did no better when resurveyed last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says it will tighten up procedures. One man's junk mail is another's expensive mailing list. Another problem for direct mail is the matter of privacy. The industry takes considerable pains to stay on the right side of a sometimes fine line. If you do n't want any catalogs, you can ask <ORGANIZATION> DMA </ORGANIZATION> to get you off the lists. More people, however, tell <ORGANIZATION> DMA </ORGANIZATION> they would like to get more catalogs than want none. A Consumer Reports survey found almost nine people in 10 were `` mostly or completely'' satisfied with their shopping by mail or phone. And <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>? After 45 million catalogs offering everything from `` Go Away'' doormats to records of three minutes of silence, he has retired to the golf course where he may reminisce about the year his Game Room offered a Christmas card bearing greetings from The First Family. Inside were a fig-leafed <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and Eve posed in their Garden. `` It seemed a cute idea,'' he says, as have catalogers since the days of the <ORGANIZATION> Babylonians </ORGANIZATION>. `` But it did n't sell worth a damn,'' which undoubtedly some Babylonian also said.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ More than 4,300 <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools have closed since the mid-1960s and enrollment in parochial schools has been cut in half. To see what can be done to reverse this decline, the leaders of 22 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> organizations are gathering in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, for a week-long summit. As one church leader says, `` The issues on the agenda are gigantic.''

 It was once almost an article of faith for new Roman Catholic parishes: They built the parochial school first and held Sunday Mass in the auditorium. The church building could wait until later. That's the way they did it at Most Precious Blood parish in <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The altar and pews were placed right in the middle of the two-story brick school building, which opened in 1960. The church, the parish figured, would rise later on the vacant lot across the driveway. But the baby boom ended, the church was never built, the parishioners aged and their children moved to the suburbs to start their own families. Next month, Most Precious Blood school will join a casualty list of 4,300 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools that have closed since the mid-1960s. Even with tuition starting at $ 1,100 a year, the school ran a deficit last year of $ 86,000, made up from the dwindling resources of a parish of 400 families. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON>, a nurse who sent her three children to the school, was on the committee that recommended closing the school. There was no fight. `` It's not that we gave up easily, but we had to take the interests of the few and think of the whole parish,'' she said. `` How do you ask an older group of people to raise a $ 100,000 subsidy? It's impossible. It's un-Christian.'' Schools like Most Precious Blood have been squeezed in the vise of rising costs and declining enrollments that persist despite some studies that show Catholic schools achieve better academic results, especially for minority students, and send more students to college than their public counterparts. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools have lost 3 million students since 1964, including 103,000 last year alone, when 110 schools closed. This year's enrollment of 2,623,000 is down 3.8 percent from a year ago, and off 53 percent from the peak of 5.6 million in 1964. The Catholic population actually has grown over that same period and become more prosperous. But as <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> moved to the suburbs, the schools did not follow them. Pastors `` no longer have the large armies of sisters and brothers, especially the sisters, to staff the schools,'' says Sister <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NCEA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. Nuns and priests taught 75 percent of the classes in Catholic schools in 1960. Today, nearly 83 percent of the 140,000 teachers at 8,992 Catholic schools are lay women and men. `` Neither the parishes nor the dioceses nor the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> people as a whole were really prepared to absorb the costs that came about after <PERSON> Vatican </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>,'' as many nuns left their orders and some of those who remained chose ministries other than teaching, <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON> says. This Thursday, May 19, <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON> and the leaders of 21 other <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> organizations will gather in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, for a week-long summit to try to forge a common vision for the future of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The issues on the agenda are gigantic,'' says <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON>, whose organization began working with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> three years ago to lay the groundwork for the symposium, called the Catholic Education Futures Project. They will be exploring ways to spare other inner-city parochial schools the fate of Most Precious Blood, perhaps through new financial arrangements and organizing Catholic schools by region and clusters of parishes, instead of as single parish entities. The symposium at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> also will explore religious education for the majority of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> children who do not attend <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools, and adult instruction. The Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>'s secretary for education, and a prime mover behind the <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> meeting, says, `` It's probably the first time in 20 years that these groups involved in one form or fashion of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education have ever had the opportunity to sit down We are not only preparing ourselves for the future, but preparing the future for us. We can shape the future.'' The <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> archdiocese already has started trying to revamp its parochial schools. In a 1986 pastoral letter, Archbishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> spoke of the need to adopt an `` interparochial school structure'' and to set tuition at full cost, with tuition assistance for families unable to pay the full freight. The schools are to be run not by individual pastors or parish councils, but independent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school boards in each of 12 regions of the archdiocese, which stretches from the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION>, Md. `` We're being looked at by other dioceses all over the country,'' says <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, the archdiocese's superintendent of schools. `` We really have taken a position that has been somewhat unpopular among our people.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, the first archdiocese in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was the site of three 19th century plenary councils that gave impetus to creation of the world's largest system of Catholic schools. The American bishops, at their third plenary council here in 1884, proclaimed: `` Near every church, when it does not already exist, a parochial school is to be erected within two years from the promulgation of this Council, and to be kept up in the future, unless in the judgment of the bishop the erection and maintenance of the school is impossible.'' Any priest `` gravely negligent in erecting the school'' or running it `` can and must be removed from that church ...'' the bishops decreed. `` All Catholic parents are bound to send their children to parochial schools.'' Catholic schools existed as far back as colonial days, but their numbers grew in step with <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> immigration in the mid-1800's and beyond to the big cities of the East There, according to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> sociologist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Davison </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, they `` provided havens for <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION> committed to preserving their ethnic and religious heritage'' in a Protestant-dominated society. But in the modern era, as <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> prospered and grew more comfortable with life in a pluralistic and secular <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they came to rely less on their parochial schools, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> says. The bishops' injunction to <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> parents fell by the wayside. `` The fact of the matter was we did n't have enough room,'' says <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` You could n't go out and tell everybody to put their youngsters in a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school, and you ca n't lay a guilt trip on parents who ca n't afford it.'' The Catholic school enrollment slump has hit elementary schools the hardest. High schools often were organized by region or diocese to begin with, or sponsored by such orders as the Jesuits or Sisters of the Sacred Heart, and they drew from a wider base than parish schools. In 1965, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> had 113 elementary schools with 61,000 students. Today it has 86 with 24,000. A quarter-century ago, 80 percent of its teachers were nuns drawing stipends of $ 600 a year. Today, the archdiocese pays the nuns $ 7,000, while lay teachers' salaries start at $ 12,416, almost $ 6,000 below the scale in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> public schools As recently as 1970, most Baltimore Catholic schools charged less than $ 100 tuition a year. Even at tuition rates of $ 1,100 and $ 1,200 a year, <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> says, it is hard to pay a living wage to teachers who have families of their own. The superintendent also believes <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders have not done enough to encourage parents to use the Catholic schools. `` Today you rarely hear anyone talk about the values of Catholic schools from the pulpit,'' he says. `` So many people have children in public schools, they do n't want to offend anyone.'' Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> NCEA </ORGANIZATION> convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last month that Catholic schools are closing in part because they have failed `` to make their case to the public.'' `` You ca n't wait around for tax credits or tuition vouchers or other forms of new government funding ... They are not imminent,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a Catholic who attended both public and parochial schools. He suggested that Catholic schools recruit from public schools `` the worst cases _ the dropouts, the problem discipline cases, the so-called worst five or 10 percent,'' educate them and `` then ask society for fair recompense.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> suggested that local communities or business groups pay half the $ 4,500 that public schools now spend per student. By contrast, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools spent about $ 4 billion in 1985-86, or $ 1,072 per elementary pupil and $ 2,025 for high school students. In an interview, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools `` have not been aggressive like the evangelical schools. I do n't know why because the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has certainly wanted to be aggressive on other issues. I think it would do better, frankly, presenting itself as an educator of poor children ... than as a critic of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s challenge drew a skeptical response from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school leaders. The <ORGANIZATION> NCEA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON> called it `` a very creative idea,'' but added, `` I do n't think that even <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> would think that it could be implemented entirely and literally in all parts of the country.'' `` We do have many of the potential dropouts, problem students, etc., in our schools. They do very well,'' she said. But `` if we went out and recruited, we would have to hire additional teachers, administrators, special services, remedial courses and equipment and so forth now. The schools would not be able to survive until four or five years from now with the hope that the municipality or the state might reimburse for these services.'' But she said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s idea might be useful `` as a jumping off point for some pilot projects,'' paid for by private industry or foundations.

 Public educators generally do not regard Catholic schools as doing them any favors. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said that even in the inner cities, parochial schools educate `` a select group.'' `` They are kids who will sit still, who will keep quiet, who will bring their homework in, who will wear a tie or certain type of uniform and whose parents are willing to put up a couple of hundred bucks, even if it's a very small amount,'' said <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>. Catholic and other religious schools have been stymied in the courts and in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in their efforts to secure more government support. Three of the past four presidents _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ promised wider help. None has delivered. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has frequently extolled the idea of tuition tax credits, but he has been unable to obtain them. The administration also believes strongly in giving parents wider choice in education, but lately it has been talking primarily about choice among public schools. The 1965 legislation that provided remedial aid for disadvantaged children specifically allowed religious schools to take part. But a 5-4 ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> drove the remedial classes out of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school buildings and into vans or other sites off the premises. Minority enrollment in Catholic schools has doubled since 1970. Blacks, Hispanics and other minorities now comprise 22 percent of all students. Sixty-four percent of the 234,300 black pupils are not Catholic. Studies by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> sociologist, and others have found <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> students out-performing their public school counterparts on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> reading and writing tests. The gap between the average performance of black and white pupils is narrower than in public schools. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, in a study on the high school Class of 1982, found the dropout rate between the sophomore and senior year was 14 percent for public school students, but only 3.4 percent for those in <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school. <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> education professor, says, `` There is an institutional pull toward academic pursuits in Catholic schools for all students, regardless of their ethnic, social and academic background, that we do not see in the public schools.'' Fifty-four of the 149 students at Most Precious Blood are black. Among them is 13-year-old <PERSON> Alethia </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, a seventh grader. `` All the schools I go to close down,'' she said. This is the third <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school that has gone under for her. The Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, the third pastor at Most Precious Blood in as many years, says, `` One reason we hate to see our school leave here is that this is our greatest evangelization tool ... Most of the people moving into the community are black, so it would be a real opportunity to start building, but we could n't possibly afford to hang in there long enough to do anything like that.'' Before becoming a priest, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> was a cost analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> Rouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` As soon as I arrived and started looking at papers I realized that, oh, my goodness, this does n't seem like this is very responsible in a parish this size carrying this much of a financial burden.'' The principal of Most Precious Blood, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, says enrollment had dropped from more than 200 four years ago to 149 this year. She expects most of her pupils to transfer to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Padua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, 2 -LCB- miles away. The parishes and parents' groups have arranged a union. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> has 416 students now and a capacity of 700; its tuition is somewhat higher. The nine teachers on <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s staff earn from $ 12,000 to $ 18,000. Three are newlyweds without children, but some are women raising families by themselves. <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who teaches math and science to the upper grades, had her application in with <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> city and county schools even before the news came of the closing. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, `` It puts a lot of stress on a person. The emotions vary. It runs from anger. You're angry because the hierarchy who appears on the outside to care, when it comes down to the gut level, sometimes it seems like they really do n't.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and her former husband pay $ 1,900 to send their daughter to a Catholic high school. She calls Most Precious Blood `` a very close, family-type school where <PERSON> God </PERSON> is brought into their life throughout, not just in religion class.'' But she says, `` I'll be honest, if I were in the county and there was a good public school system, I'd send my kid to public school.'' She fears that <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools `` will turn more into private, private schools where only the rich will be able to afford it.'' END ADV for Sunday, May 15

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ With foreign investment at record levels and tourists swarming over the countryside, the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> nations of southern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are starting to catch up with their industrialized neighbors to the north. There are some persistent problems to be sure, but one chief of state predicts the region will become `` the motor of the European Community.''

 After decades of instability and stagnation, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s southern nations are enjoying a surge of economic growth that hints at a potential American-style Sun Belt in the Old World. Following World War II, a succession of shaky governments led <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> were ruled by dictatorships or military-backed governments. Their economies grew by fits and starts. Now, for the first time, all five countries _ three of them led by English-speaking economists _ have governments or coalitions likely to lead them into the 1990s. Growth rates are generally higher than the European norm and foreign investment has reached record levels. `` The center of gravity of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has moved south,'' says Portuguese Premier <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> won a landslide victory in the 1987 elections. `` The southern nations will now become the motor of the European Community.'' In the 1980s, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> joined the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, marking a more forceful <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> presence in the trade bloc, with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> knocking on the door for membership. `` The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> would like to turn the south of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into a developed area resembling the northern countries,'' says <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Pergola </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Sicilian-born, Harvard-educated minister for European Community Relations. `` This could create a Sun Belt like in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in this area.'' The Brussels-based Community forecasts that the population in its southern tier will grow faster than in its northern areas. Industrialization, drawing its manpower from the higher birth rates, may thus trigger economic growth similar to that in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that led to a migration from the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> to the southeastern Sun Belt states. Symbolizing the area's new dynamism are <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s multimillion-dollar preparations for the World's Fair in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> in 1992 and the Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> the same year <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> are cooling their disputes over <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil rights and the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to focus instead on streamlining their old-fashioned economies. And <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the sick man of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the 1970s, has become one of its economic superstars and now claims to have replaced <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as the fifth richest Western nation. Nowadays, 76 percent of Italian households have a car, compared with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 58 percent, while 81 percent have dishwashers, against 77 percent for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. But smart cars and flashy clothes are not <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s only visible signs of prosperity. Italian entrepreneurs were involved in 28 of 68 European mergers and takeovers completed over the past two years. Businessmen are anticipating an economic free-for-all in 1992, when Common Market currency and tariffs finally come down. More than 320 million Europeans will trade goods and services in a single market, fulfilling the visionary plans of the Community's founders when they signed the treaty of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in 1957 Among them is <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedettti </PERSON>, a 53-year-old engineer who transformed the <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> typewriter firm into a computer giant and is battling for control of the 166-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest holding company. <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> automakers, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest private company, is credited with spearheading <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s economic revival in the early 1980s. Holdings controlled by the <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON> family range from communications and media properties, food processing and biotech industries to mutual funds and robot makers. Illustrating newfound confidence in southern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, two leading West German banks _ <ORGANIZATION> DeutscheBank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bayerische </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vereinsbank </ORGANIZATION> _ last year took over Italian branches of <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> respectively. Although <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s five-party coalition government still plays political musical chairs, the economy purrs on. Two days after Premier <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Goria </PERSON> resigned on March 11, for the third time during his seven-month tenure, the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> stock market recorded its largest gain since the start of the year. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapalombara </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor, argues in his book `` Democracy, Italian Style'' that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s most glaring problem _ political instability _ is more apparent than real, and is in fact a positive measure of the country's heady spirit for survival and change. Coming up fast on the west of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> rim are <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s newest members. Both recorded 4 percent growth rates last year, double the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> average, contrasted with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s near zero growth last year. `` <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> form the area of greatest economic growth in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and are the countries that exhibit the best economic prospects for the next five years,'' says <PERSON> Pedro-Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuczynski </PERSON>, a Peruvian banker with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, foreign investors last year poured $ 7.9 billion into the economy _ twice the 1986 amount _ to fund one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s fast-track economies, moving toward what the Spaniards call `` El Horizonte'92'' -LRB- Horizon'92 -RRB- `` I see an important new axis, from <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, bringing the center of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> southward,'' says <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cebrian </PERSON>, the editor of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pais </ORGANIZATION>. `` <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> are coming together in a way we would have thought unbelievable only a few years ago,'' he says. The <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> Olympic Games and the <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION>'s Fair in 1992 will create new housing, high-tech communications, and rail and road networks, at an estimated cost of $ 8.9 billion. The streets of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> are now choked with shiny new cars, triple-parked. Auto sales increased by 29 percent last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Makers </ORGANIZATION>. Using skilled <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> labor at lower cost than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is building an advanced microchip plant near <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. And at some rchards in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> computers are used to keep track of the orange crop. Reaching across continents, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has signed a $ 3 billion accord with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to form joint-venture companies financed by both countries.

 `` We lost the industrial revolution, but we're going to win the post-industrial revolution,'' says Spanish banker <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sola </PERSON>. What triggered <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s development was the smooth transition from General <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s 40-year dictatorship to the pro-business socialist government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. In neighboring <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s poorest member, another political switch has spurred economic growth. Prime Minister <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> has brought stability in the wake of 16 years of revolving-door governments. Many wealthy Portuguese, who left the country after a 1974 leftist revolution that toppled a 42-year dictatorship, have returned to dance in fashionable <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> nightspots and to present their daughters at lavish debutante balls. <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a 48-year-old former economics professor, is pushing ahead with privatization of dozens of large state-owned companies, including tobacco, banking, media and insurance interests. `` The degree of confidence in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> is very, very high,'' the premier says. The first state-controlled company to be put on the block as part of <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s privatization program is EPSI, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s largest producer of polyethylene and polypropylene The Italian <ORGANIZATION> Enichem </ORGANIZATION> company is at the top of the list of prospective buyers. Cheap labor, which compares favorably with costs in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, has attracted foreign manufacturers and brought unemployment down to 6.6 percent, the lowest in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> after <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. A $ 2-an-hour minimum wage brings in high-tech industries like <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>, which recently launched a $ 43 million expansion of an electronics plant at <LOCATION> Oporto </LOCATION> that employs 1,000 people. Tourism is also booming, with around 10 million foreigners vacationing in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> every year to make the industry a $ 1-billion-a-year business. At the other end of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, tourism is still <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s biggest foreign exchange earner A record 8 million tourists spent $ 3.2 billion last year. Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s Socialist government, in a reversal of former policy, now wants to broaden the country's economic base and attract foreign capital into <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> firms through freer financial markets. Reforms of the banking system are laying the groundwork for a money market that will allow American brokerage houses to buy seats on the booming <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> stock market. Western European investors, taking advantage of new measures permitting their profits to be repatriated, last year poured more than $ 52 million into the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> exchange last year. `` <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> is changing at last,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Costopoulos </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Creditbank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s biggest private bank. Greeks can now apply for home mortgages and bank interest rates are high enough to attract private depositors. `` Overall modernization of the economy is the basic condition for our survival and growth,'' says National Economy Minister <PERSON> Panayotis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roumeliotis </PERSON>, who coordinates economic policy. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and Turkish Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> have reached a `` no-war'' agreement and set up a hot line telephone between their capitals to defuse tensions between the two <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members. Bankers and businessmen are firmly behind the current Greek-Turkish rapprochement. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, which in the 17th century camped 300,000 men before the gates of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, firing cannons into the city in order to enter <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, applied to join the Common Market in April 1987. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> says it wo n't automatically block the application. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the only Islamic nation among the five southern <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries, is making a bid to replace war-torn <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as a banking center for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. At the same time, its new seaside resorts are luring Western tourists for bargain vacations. More than 3 million foreigners spent $ 2 billion in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> last year, a 60 percent earnings increase over 1986. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> official, says that his export drive and free-market policies _ including the privatization of state monopolies _ brought growth of 7 percent last year that will enable <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s economy `` to skip a century.'' Luxuries like whiskey, instant coffee and French champagne are now snapped up in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, where the per capita income is half that of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. Massive investment in energy, transport and communications have transformed many towns into huge construction sites. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is now planning a third bridge over the Bosporus waterway, reflecting the country's determination to link itself with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> absorbs more than 40 percent of all Turkish exports, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is home to 1.4 million Turkish workers and their families. But with a 67 percent inflation rate, a currency crunch and a huge foreign debt, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> still has a long way to go to reach the prosperity of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries. For the other southern European countries, the worldwide October stock market crash also highlighted persistent problems. _ <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is facing wildcat strikes in transport and industry, a 12 percent unemployment rate and a runaway national debt And the south of the country, still plagued by crime syndicates like the Mafia, lags economically far behind the north. _ In <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, stagnant exports, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s lowest productivity and a huge public sector deficit keep growth rates low _ In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the Socialists are troubled by <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest unemployment _ 21 percent in 1987 _ and union protesters filled the streets of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> when the government suggested that state and private employers not grant wage hikes of more than 5 percent _ In <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, the per capita income of $ 2,500 is only half that of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and Premier <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> concedes that people still go hungry And if the pace of development ca n't be speeded up in southern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the economic spurt that is ending <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> poverty may run out of steam in the competitive post-1992 market. `` Unless there's cohesion among the 12 EEC nations, development in the southern regions will be like quicksand,'' says <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pergola </ORGANIZATION>, the Italian minister. `` Cohesion must start at the bottom, the south, through new forms of financial engineering.''

 <LOCATION> ROME </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Here are brief biographies of the leaders of five key nations in southern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> ITALY </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Premier <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Goria </PERSON>, 44, who resigned March 11, has been asked by President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> to remain as caretaker premier until a new leader is chosen. Party leader <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> is currently trying to put together another five-party coalition. <PERSON> Goria </PERSON>, a former accountant from the northern city of <LOCATION> Asti </LOCATION>, was a surprise choice for premier when he took office on Aug. 1, 1987 at the head of the shaky coaltaly's 47th postwar government. <PERSON> Goria </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s youngest premier ever. <PERSON> Goria </PERSON> previously served as treasury minister and was credited in that post with loosening the country's restrictive foreign exchition that was <PERSON> Iange </PERSON> controls and with helping to bring double-digit inflation to its present level of about 5 percent. He is married and has two children. <LOCATION> SPAIN </LOCATION> _ Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a 46-year-old <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> labor lawyer, took office in December 1982 following a landslide victory of his <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He had no previous government experience but was head of the parliamentary opposition after <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> returned to democracy in 1977. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> is married to sch <LOCATION> ROME </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ World War II left the nations of southern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> bombed-out and poor, devastated by six years of combat while a few neutral countries led by dictators watched from the sidelines. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was brought to its knees by the Nazi occupation and the Allied invasion, while right-wing dictators kept a tight grip on <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> was plunged into civil war between Communists and nationalists. Moslem <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> was reeling from abrupt change wrought by wartime contact with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> struggled back on track after 21 years of rule by Fascist dictator <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> with elections in 1946. Funds from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marshall Plan laid the groundwork for industrialization. The Christian Democrats, in power through much of the postwar period, presided over dramatic economic expansion by the 1960s that was termed an `` economic miracle.'' But in the 1970s, political instability and worker unrest brought economic crisis and fueled terrorism led by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigades </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the pro-German fascist regime of General <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> won the bitter civil war of 1936-1939, but watched World War II from neutral sidelines. In the'60s and'70s, <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> backed the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, traditional landowners and industrialists but suppressed free-market business initiatives. After <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s death in 1975, the country quickly blossomed into an ebullient democracy under a constitutional monarch, King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> also watched from the sidelines under the dictatorship of Antonio de <PERSON> Oliveira </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> which lasted 42 years until 1974. The country veered left after a 1974 revolution, but stabilized in the 1980s under business-minded, centrist governments. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> recovered economically from the devastating 1946-49 civil war thanks to <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> Plan funds. Political instability in the 1960s after years of right-wing government triggered the 1967 colonels' dictatorship, which collapsed after the 1974 invasion of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>.

The economically backward country became a firm ally of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid helped cut down state capitalism in favor of free enterprise and Westernization in the 1950s. A short-lived military takeover in 1960 ushered in a period of political and economic problems that led to street violence in the 1970s by Marxist revolutionaries, right-wing `` Gray Wolves'' and separatist Kurds. The military took over again in 1980, but a pro-Western democracy was restored in parliamentary elections held in 1983.

 In a box-shaped, soundproof room, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Parada </PERSON> stands before a piano keyboard pulled from its shining 9-foot body. <PERSON> Parada </PERSON> plinks at the keys, listening carefully, making adjustments instinctively. No music pours from the instrument. Parada is not a pianist. Instead, he `` turns music boxes into Steinways,'' spending 24 hours with the inner workings of each piano, creating concert grands for artists from <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> to <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. `` The piano must allow an artist to develop his talents. It is not like an automobile, where it works the same for everybody _ you turn the wheel right, the automobile goes right,'' explains <PERSON> Parada </PERSON>, who does things the old-fashioned way at <ORGANIZATION> Steinway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons. In fact, everything's done much the same way it's been done since <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON> arrived from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1853 and switched from cabinetmaking to keyboards. The Steinway piano is still hand-strung, fussed and fawned over, individually numbered, tuned and retuned by highly skilled specialists like <PERSON> Parada </PERSON>. It still takes one full year to create the Steinway concert grand, `` the piano by which all others are judged,'' the product of more than 100 patented piano-making techniques. It remains the choice of the great pianists _ <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrau </PERSON>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> _ as it was the choice of <PERSON> Ignace </PERSON> <PERSON> Paderewski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Liszt </PERSON> a century ago. `` It's the only piano for me,'' says <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nero </PERSON>. `` I was 13 when I started in competition at the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>, 14 when I started at Juilliard, and it's been Steinway all the way.'' In June, the 500,000 th Steinway, designed by artist <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON>, will be unveiled at a Carnegie Hall concert <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION>, its top competitor, reaches the 500,000 mark every 2 -LCB- years on its assembly line in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The Steinway does n't come cheap either: The price list runs from $ 7,500 to $ 40,000 for the 9-foot concert grand. <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION>'s least expensive piano costs about $ 2,700, while its concert grand prices are about the same as Steinway. How has Steinway survived 135 years, outlasting an assortment of competitors while keeping its reputation for quality? `` A Steinway is a Steinway only because we do n't cut any corners,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON>, 70, one of the last two family members still in the piano-making business. `` We make quality, nothing but the top quality we can make. `` My great-grandfather started that when he started the firm 135 years ago. I often say we're probably thickheaded and stubborn. We stick to our principles. But it works.'' `` The Steinway manufacturing process relies on tradition,'' offers <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Garlick </PERSON>, an antique piano aficionado now employed as <ORGANIZATION> Steinway </ORGANIZATION>'s national field service manager. `` That tradition has carried on, although we do n't ignore technology.'' Instead, an exacting process which combines the innovative and the antiquated is used to create 3,400 Steinway pianos each year at the company's 11-acre Queens factory. In one part of the plant, a worker hand-trims pieces of veneer for the piano's outer surface with a 120-year-old machine. Later in the process, a newly developed machine perfectly shapes its soundboard to fit the piano body. `` Even that is not a production-line concept,'' says <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, president of the firm since <ORGANIZATION> Steinway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Musical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, bought it three years ago. `` It's letting technology do something even better than we could do it before. One man still handles that job alone.'' There are many answers as to what makes a Steinway a Steinway: the input of the artists, the commitment to quality, the genius of 19th-century piano meister C.F. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON>. But those responses may miss the forest for the trees, which provide the Steinway wood.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: Steinway wood.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` One of the things done right here is we use only good wood,'' says <PERSON> Garlick </PERSON>. `` We have people constantly looking throughout the world for good wood.'' The wood _ imported mahogany, northeast rock maple, yellow poplar _ is improved through aging. Air-dried outdoors for up to 18 months, the wood is then kiln-dried to remove the moisture and run through the mill for shaving and rough shaping. Each piano's outer rim is bent in a process which appears more likely to splinter wood than shape it. For the grand piano, it involves seven men, 19 panels of wood 22 feet long, plenty of pushing, and a winch. Amazingly, the wood does n't break but bends into the shape of a concert grand. The process is repeated 150 times a year on the machine developed in 1880 by C.F. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON>, the family's acknowledged piano genius The pieces of wood in the rim are individually coated with old-fashioned animal glue. `` It sets up very fast, very strong, and it's acoustically sound,'' <PERSON> Garlick </PERSON> explains. A soundboard is cut to the specifications of each rim. It's slightly curved and ribs are attached by hand _ two more Steinway innovations But perhaps the most important function, a simple task which determines each succeeding step, occurs in the Steinway foundry. Metal plates shipped in from <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, are punched with two holes taken from the original drawings of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON>. Known as the reference holes, these quarter-inch puncture marks serve no purpose other than to guide creation of the piano from that point forward. The soundboard, the stringing, the placement of the keyboard _ everything revolves around the two marks. `` It's been the same two holes since Day One,'' <PERSON> Garlick </PERSON> says. In the aptly named body-stretching stage, an employee climbs inside the piano rim and pushes out with his hands and feet before the plate and soundboard are fitted. The piano `` action'' _ its hammers, felt and other interior parts _ are painstakingly pieced together and subjected to repeated quality checks. By the time the piano is assembled, wired and shipped to <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Parada </PERSON>'s department, it has gone through 25 to 30 checkpoints. The workers responsible for bigger jobs like soundboard placement, piano stringing and tone adjustment often sign their work. `` It's an aspiration of everybody to be immortal, and so, like an artist signs his painting, I sign the piano,'' explains <PERSON> Parada </PERSON>, his voice growing soft. `` I put into the piano the best of myself.'' His attitude is pervasive throughout the plant. Three piano-stringers working side by side in the factory use three different methods to perform their task, each convinced his way is the right way. `` We do n't mind that. We encourage the little rivalries between them, because the product comes out good,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON>, who began his career running wood from the yard to the factory. The unique process at the plant means each piano will sound a bit different. The company allows any perspective buyer, be it <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nero </PERSON> or <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Zero </PERSON>, to play several pianos and pick the one which sounds best to them. The future of Steinway holds an immediate challenge: a frontal assault by <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> on their once near-exclusive concert grand market. There are some defectors. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> played a <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> grand on his recent album `` The Bridge'' and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON>, winner of the 1987 best new artist Grammy, does n't use a Steinway. While <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> made its first concert grands in 1902, they only recently began concentrating on the grand piano market. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION>'s doing a very good job these days, but it's still not a Steinway,'' says <PERSON> Nero </PERSON>, who owns four

 For more than a century, since 1853, the male descendants of a German immigrant cabinetmaker followed their fathers into the business of making quality pianos. But the curtain appears to be coming down on that tradition. The fourth generation of Steinways in the business apparently is the last. Just two of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON>'s descendants, both of them past retirement age, remain with the company. <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON> are now consultants with <ORGANIZATION> Steinway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons, providing the final link with the creator of the Steinway piano, their great-grandfather. `` They're really involved in a special way. We value them highly,'' says <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, current president of Steinway. `` What better link do we have with the past and tradition?'' The new generation of descendants of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON> chose different routes. `` None of the kids were interested in coming in,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON>, 70, over the constant plink-plink-plink of piano-tuning outside the office he shares with his brother. `` They all wanted to go out and do their own thing. `` We've got a banker, we've got a computer expert, we've got an architect _ we've all kinds of things in the next generation.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON> can recall childhood dinner guests like <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Rachmaninoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> breaking bread at the Steinway table. His father often took the two brothers on weekend day trips to the piano factory in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. `` I got brought in with my mother's milk, in a way,'' recalls <PERSON> John </PERSON>, sitting inside <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Steinway Hall, an ornate piano showcase-museum. `` I was brought up in it.'' Walking around Steinway Hall, <PERSON> John </PERSON> is greeted time and time again by workers he's known for years. `` Number 237 _ that's <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>'s piano,'' <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON> says, pointing to a concert grand, one of about a dozen kept in the basement for use by visiting performers. `` That's one of his bats.'' <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON> recalls the day he decided to become a piano man. `` In those days, a job was a job,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON>, who joined the firm in the late 1930s. `` My father said, ` If you want to work with the company, fine. You go out to the factory at 7:30 in the morning, and start your apprenticeship.' Which I did.'' Three years later he began moving up in the company. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> became president of the company, while <PERSON> John </PERSON> handled marketing and production. When the inevitable became apparent in 1972, when there were no members of the Steinway family to move into the business, the decision was made to sell. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> purchased <ORGANIZATION> Steinway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons, but the corporation's handling of the family trade struck a bad chord with Steinway `` We were not very happy with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, as part of a large corporation,'' <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON> says. The company was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Steinway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Musical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in 1985. `` It's worked out well,'' <PERSON> Steinway </PERSON> says, puffing on a cigarette and tugging on his suspenders. `` I'm very happy, because I look to the future and think it's good. `` The piano will go on.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Some people go through life with a sure touch for the practicalities of everyday life. Others flounder.

 Who among us was raised with an innate knowledge of which telephone company gives us the best deal? Who, in fact, ever dreamed that picking a telephone company would be a way of life in 1988? And if you `` would n't buy a used car from that man,'' whom would you buy one from? And how do you negotiate with him when you're not even really sure what rack and pinion means? What about the jungle of financial jargon that everyone else seems to understand _ like CD's, <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s, deferred annuity bonds, <LOCATION> Keoghs </LOCATION>, municipals, etc.? It was simpler when people just went to the bank that gave the best toaster. If you already had a toaster, the next toughest choice was whether you wanted the Revere Ware pots or a non-brand that had pretty yellow flowers on it. These are things that almost everyone, at some point in life _ just starting out, after a divorce, recently widowed _ must learn to deal with without getting stung in the process. `` You are n't born with this knowledge. Kids of people who own businessess or are in the financial world might know some of it, but most of us do n't,'' says <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON>, a former national consumer affairs correspondent for television, and author of `` <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON>'s Guide to Living on Your Own,'' due in bookstores early this summer. `` This book is not for people who see an ad on television and send $ 5 away and expect to get a diamond ring in return. They deserve what they get. This book is for reasonably intelligent people who must face these kinds of things for the first time and are n't aware of the pitfalls. `` This book is not about the things your mother never told you, it's about the things your father never told you,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON>. Like taxes, audits, how much insurance you need, which health club to join, how to pick a telephone company and how to deal with the media if you've gotten yourself into a mess that would incidentally make a good story. A lot of the advice comes from <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON>'s nearly 17 years in radio and television, first teaching art on cable TV, then covering the courts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and later as the consumer affairs expert there and ultimately for CBS. She often got tips from viewers who had been ripped off by one scheme or another. As a local reporter, she named names and products. `` That's the job of the local reporter, but I do n't do that in the book,'' she says. `` This is more of a household encyclopedia that would be applicable anywhere.'' She explains, for instance, some of the oldest tricks in the books, such as the bait and switch ruse, and how not to go for the bait. It's a practical book. The section on health clubs, for instance, warns against paying the annual membership fee to clubs that have n't opened yet. Some have gone under before they got going. Others, she warns, may be on shaky financial ground, so check them out before handing over your check for a year's membership Also figure out what you really need. Are you paying for fancy exercise machines that you're not likely to use. Or a swimming pool, when what you really want is the racquet ball court? She advises going to <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION>'s or schools to see if you might get the facilities you want much cheaper. Or, go to a club that has only the facilities you actually intend using. It will probably be cheaper.

 She confesses to being a victim herself, joining health clubs to drop that extra 20 pounds that always crept back on. She finally calculated that her demanding schedule, working long days, made it impractical; her visits turned out to cost her $ 40 a session. Her book tells you what questions to ask up front and urges the timid to push for answers to key questions, especially, `` What is this going to cost me?'' `` Healthy skepticism is important,'' she says. `` A financial planner or an accountant should be able to explain things to you without talking down to you and telling you to ` just trust me.' `` Ask him or her about fees, about how much of his income is derived from commissions, ask for references, look for possible conflicts of interest.'' She tells how to find out what the car dealer paid for the car he is selling you, the toll-free 800 number to call to find out whether the model of used car you're considering has ever been recalled, how to spot cosmetic cover-ups on a used car. <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON>, 43, and recently remarried, says her book draws on files she had kept as a television consumer expert. `` I spent a lot of time on the telephone updating things, and re-interviewing people, but basically it was years and years of reporting that went into the book,'' she says. If you're going to try the media, she tells you how. First, do all the work yourself. The local reporter or columnist does n't have time to unearth every single aspect of your case. They get hundreds, maybe thousands of letters from irate consumers seeking to enlist the newspaper in their cases. You, the abused, must document your claim, agree to be interviewed, and, if you live in a multimedia town, do n't ship out carbons to every reporter in town. Pick the one you like best, offer an exclusive story, and hope for the best. It helps if the story is interesting and has broad appeal. <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> had an unusual career trail. She was accepted by the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, but fell in love and married instead. A talented artist, whose apartment is decorated with <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> originals, she worked for an advertising agency, taught art in high school, and decided that if <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Child </PERSON> could teach French cooking on television, she could teach art on there. So she did. She did radio interviews around the feminist movement, covered the courts for a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> TV station, and worked as an artist at the same time. `` You learn that lawyers are very repetitive,'' she says. `` The first time they said something, I took notes, the second time I started sketching the jurors and the third time I added the color.'' She turned down the job as consumer affairs reporter the first time it was offered. `` I thought it was going to be all fluff,'' she says. `` I thought it was the equivalent of being the weather girl. `` The second time it was offered, it was explained that it would be more of a <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> sort of thing. We were going after companies and individuals that were ripping off the public. That I liked.'' <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> grew up in the suburbs of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> with pretty much of a belief in the goodness of her fellow human beings. `` I really did n't know there were these kind of people, people who simply preyed on others as a way of life,'' she says.

 Vibraphonist <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, who just turned 75, is leading a swinging band of 17 musicians mostly in their 20s, following the beat of another generation. `` We're doing big business on the road,'' says <PERSON> Hamp </PERSON>, as he is known to his friends. `` We play every night. We pack the house. I do n't have to play rock' n' roll. I play what I always played, like ` Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar.''' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, who was in the first racially integrated group in jazz _ <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>'s quartet _ wrote his most famous composition `` Flying Home'' in 1937. He estimates he has played it 300 times a year for 51 years and it `` still stops the show.'' `` I like to play with this band,'' says <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, who recruits his musicians from among college graduates who majored in jazz. `` The guys are all interested. Everybody tries to play better than he played last night. That makes it fun. `` I'm trying to play better than I played last night, too.'' The band spent its annual stint in February at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lionel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>, where some 15,000 high schoolers came to seminars. It opened the Jazzport at <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s South Street Seaport with two two-hour concerts on both April 1 and 2 and played a benefit for jazz radio station WBGO-FM at Town Hall on April 7 After a birthday bash at <PERSON> Regine </PERSON>'s here on April 19, the band left the next day _ <ORGANIZATION> Hampton </ORGANIZATION>'s 75th birthday _ on a tour of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, who plans to campaign for the Republicans, will play jazz festivals this summer and appear at the Hollywood Bowl and <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>. He's invited to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for two weeks and on a jazz cruise for eight days. The grin, the unrestrained energy, buoyant personality and showmanship are still <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s hallmarks _ along with his melodic and swinging performing style. `` When I was a kid, I always wanted to put on a show,'' he recalls. `` I liked to get in the moonshine at night, doing like I'm on the stage I always liked to be taking bows.'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, says that when his father joined the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> his mother moved him to her family home in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> where he was raised by his grandmother. `` We used to go to the Holiness Church every time the church door opened,'' he recalls. `` There was a swinging band there _ trumpets, saxophones, guitars. We sat down in one of the front pews next to where the band was. When the sister beating the bass drum would get happy and start up and down the aisles, I took the mallets and started beating the bass drum. It was my introduction to music.'' Not only has he stayed with music, <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> says, `` I also stayed with the Bible and religion all the time.'' A framed picture of his grandmother, <PERSON> Livinia </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, rests on the grand piano in <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment. `` I was crazy about my grandmother,'' he says. When the family moved to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where the schools were tough, his grandmother sent him to a Roman Catholic school in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION>. There a nun taught him how to play the snare drum, and how to twirl the sticks, toss and catch them. Back in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he joined <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Hite </PERSON>'s band as a drummer. At age 15 he followed <PERSON> Hite </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and two years later they auditioned to back <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> at <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> liked us so well he took us recording with him,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> recalls. `` There was a set of vibes in a corner. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> said, ` Do you know how to play it? Move it out here in the middle of the floor and play something for me.'

 `` I had been in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Defender Newsboys Band in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. They had a xylophone; it's got the same keyboard. I played drums in the marching band and timpani and xylophone in the concert band. We had a good bandmaster, Maj. <PERSON> Endicott </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who had graduated in music from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heidelberg </ORGANIZATION>. He taught me German harmony. Anybody interested, he would teach them.'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> had studied <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>'s records, so on that October day in 1930 he romped through <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>'s trumpet solo in `` Big Butter and Egg Man'' on the vibraphone. `` It knocked <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> out,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> says. They recorded eight songs that day. On the first one, <PERSON> Eubie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>'s `` Memories of You,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> played vibes while <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> sang and the drums while <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> played his trumpet. The <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Hite </PERSON> <PERSON> Band </PERSON> backed <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> for nine months at the <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> became known. When the engagement ended, <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> assembled his first band. They traveled, in four cars and a trailer for his drums and vibes, from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, B.C. `` I always played good dance music and played jazz for a show. I built up a following,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> says. `` I play a lot of dances now. They always ask me to make return engagements. Young people dance, too. I'm just back from a teen-age affair in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. There were 5,000 kids there. We were supposed to quit at 10:30. At 12:30 they were yelling for more and stomping on the floor.'' In the early 1930s, <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> traded touring for a job in the Paradise Nightclub across the street from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> train station. They'd leave the doors open, <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> says, and sailors arriving to paint the town would come in. Beer was 25 cents a pitcher and there was sawdust on the floor. `` I had a good band there,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> says. `` <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> was at the Palomar Ballroom. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> was with him. Naturally <PERSON> John </PERSON> would ask where he could hear some good jazz. He heard us and he brought <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> down. Lo and behold, I'm on the bandstand playing and I hear a guy playing clarinet beside me. I could tell it was <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s famous clarinet. It was Aug. 19, 1936. I'll never forget. We played like that about two hours straight. People were calling people and they were coming from all over town. That place was packed and jammed. We was blowing. `` <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> asked me to come the next morning to a recording date. I went and we did ` Moonglow' and ` Dinah.' Those records got so popular, <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> kept calling me to come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. We thought he was kidding. `` The Paradise took the sawdust off the floor and put tablecloths on the tables. It was $ 1.25 to come in. After that jam session, you could n't get in, even with the price of admission. We got super-famous overnight, because <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> had come and christened us.'' On Nov. 11, 1936, <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> joined the <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> Quartet at the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Everything was segregated then, black and white,'' he says. `` That night the barrier broke. You've got to give <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> credit.'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> says that black pianist <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had played intermission music for Goodman Band concerts and played with <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and drummer <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupa </PERSON> as the <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> Trio on records, but never live until that Nov. 11 when the trio became a quartet. `` I had four gorgeous years with <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> says. `` Then <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> had back trouble and his doctor told him to rest awhile. He got me a contract at RCA and I started making all-star records. They're re-issuing them.'' In between gigs, <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> supervises his philanthropies, the <ORGANIZATION> Lionel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Lionel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, which gives college scholarships. The <ORGANIZATION> Lionel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> added money to government money to build the low-income <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> <PERSON> Houses </PERSON>, named for his late wife, and <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> <PERSON> Houses </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> and middle-income <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>.

 The year is 1938: <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> annexes <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact lets <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> partition <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, Wrong-Way <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> flies from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, and a brash young comedian gets his own radio show on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> for Pepsodent ... We're broadcasting from <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s new building ... They tell me it costs more than Mrs. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s annual train fare.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> hit the airwaves running, ski nose into the wind, poking fun at every sacred cow in sight. As he turns 85 on May 29 and celebrates 50 years with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, first on radio and then on television, <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> has n't slowed down one bit. Over lunch in a sunny corner of his estate in the <LOCATION> Toluca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> -LRB- he has equally large digs in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> explains that with less than two weeks before he tapes an all-star birthday and anniversary salute, he was flying off to perform in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. After the two-hour special is taped, he will visit <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for five days for pre-Olympic ceremonies. On the date of the telecast, Monday, May 16, he'll be performing in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The special, reflecting <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>'s penchant for long titles, is called `` Happy Birthday <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> _ 50 <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Your </ORGANIZATION> 50 Years With <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>.'' Besides the 20 or more stars who will be at the taping, another 50 or so will appear in clips from past Hope shows. Hope's radio show lasted until 1952. He started on television in 1950. `` I came to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in 1937,'' he says, `` but before that I was on radio back East. I did a monologue on a show with <PERSON> Shep </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON> and his Rippling Rhythm.'' He also appeared with <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> on ` Hollywood Parade.''' Hope was the toast of Broadway in such plays as `` <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON>,'' `` Say When'' and `` Red Hot and Blue.'' He might have come to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> sooner than he did but he was a little miffed at the studios' lack of enthusiasm over his screen test and held out for three years. Finally, he signed with <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and launched his film career with `` The Big Broadcast of 1938.'' Another star in the movie was <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamour </PERSON>, who was later to appear with Hope and <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> in all the `` Road'' pictures. `` There was a song in the picture they wanted me to sing,'' <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> says. `` I showed it to <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> -LRB- his wife, a former singer -RRB- and she did n't think too much of it. The song was ` Thanks for the Memory.''' The song won the Oscar that year and it became <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>'s theme song. He would later do a film called `` Thanks for the Memory.'' `` I'd never done a full-length picture before and the director told me everything was done with the eyes,'' he says. `` You have to see it to believe it. I did everything but throw my eyes over my shoulders.'' On radio, his band leader was <PERSON> Skinnay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON>, his comic sidekick was <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Colonna </PERSON> and at various times his singers included <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Langford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> and Doris Day. `` We got off to a slow start, but once we started we went to first in the ratings very fast,'' he says. `` It was a combination of pictures and radio. Each helped the other. We followed ` <PERSON> Fibber </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Molly </PERSON>' on Tuesday nights and <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> came after us.'' Hope and <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> were frequent guests on each other's radio shows, in addition to the `` Road'' movies. Once <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> asked Hope to find a place for her husband, band leader <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON>. He was on the show for two years and never got a laugh. `` I met him later, after ` I Love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>,' and I said to him, ` You mean you're getting laughs?''' Hope says. `` He fell down laughing.'' Hope launched his television career on Easter Sunday 1950 with a live broadcast from the roof of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> Theater in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. His guests were <PERSON> Dinah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bea </PERSON> <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON>. Hope, finishing lunch with ice cream and a cookie, sighs and asks, `` Do you have any idea how many jokes I've done? Early in my career I did all kinds of jokes. I'd do Italian jokes. People laughed, but I was terrible with dialects. `` I was emcee at the Oriental Theater in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which showed movies. I'd introduce the band and other acts and tell jokes. After that I went into vaudeville. I had two offers but took the <ORGANIZATION> Keith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> so I could play the Palace Theater in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Out of that I got onto Broadway and got offers from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>.'' Hope does n't answer his own question about how many jokes he's told But he does have a secretary pull the scripts from his early radio shows from the files. He has two massive vaults in a building on the estate grounds where he keeps all of his material. He leafs through a loose-leaf binder holding 50-year-old jokes. `` My uncle ran for office once and the pace was kind of slow ... I pulled back the curtain on a voting machine and what do you think I found? A guy still voting for <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>.'' Another joke: `` I saw a brass band down at the train station. That is, I thought it was a brass band. I found out later it was just a shipment of spittoons going to the Republican convention.''

 On her 17th birthday last fall, <PERSON> Linzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> got a plum of a present, the title role in `` Carrie,'' the new Broadway musical about a girl with telekinetic powers. At the time, Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> was a student at the <ORGANIZATION> Italia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, a drama school in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Her acting credentials were meager: a British touring company of `` Annie'' and a small part on a television series. But the next day she was the Cinderella story in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tabloids. `` Unknown lands lead in major show co-produced by the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` It did n't sink in at all until I settled down and started rehearsing,'' Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> says now. It has been a turbulent and fast-paced few months. `` Carrie'' is based on the <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> novel that most people remember as a movie with <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacek </PERSON> playing the troubled teen-ager. In the film, <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> is taunted and tormented by other high school students and her mother before she gets revenge on prom night. `` I was told right from the beginning not to try and base myself on <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacek </PERSON>,'' Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> recalls. `` The musical tries to follow the book rather than the film because the show really is more of a tragedy than a horror story.'' `` Carrie'' is a unique collaboration of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and British theater people. With the blessing of actors' unions in both countries, the show has a joint Anglo-American cast. The director is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hands </PERSON>, artistic head of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. The music and lyrics were written by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON>, the men who wrote `` Fame.'' <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, Broadway's recent `` Sweet Charity,'' did the choreography. The show was to co-star <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> as <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON>'s bizarre and vindictive mother, but <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, dissatisfied with her role, left after the show's engagement in <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the home base of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> was so nice,'' Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> says. `` She's so motherly and was always lovely to me. I think she did n't want to be nasty, which is what the part requires.'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, who played the gym teacher in the movie version of `` Carrie,'' has now taken over the role of the mother. `` She came in and said, ` Let's get into this,''' Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> says. `` The score has n't really changed a lot since then, just the way that it is being done has. It's becoming a little weirder now. Before it was very melodic. Now it's stranger.'' Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> is from a small town near <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Her father is a toolmaker and her mother a secretary. Neither had any theatrical aspirations. Their daughter, the second of two children, did. `` When I was very young, I had a lot of energy,'' Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> says. `` I was always a real pain until I started dancing and got rid of some of that energy. She was sent to the local dancing school and got jobs in community productions. At the age of 14, she was accepted by the <PERSON> Italia </PERSON> <PERSON> Conti </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and her parents took out loans to pay the expensive tuition. `` I'm paying them back now out of my salary,'' Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> says. `` They did so much for me.'' While at the school, she auditioned for `` <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON>,'' singing `` On My Own'' from `` Les Miserables.'' After a second audition, she got the job. Her parents came to see the musical in <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> and were surprised at her performance. `` They knew that I sang well and obviously they were very confident in me or they would n't have let me go to the theater school in the first place,'' Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> says. `` But more than anything, they were shocked with the acting I was doing. They had never really seen me act.'' The young actress worked closely with Hands, best known on Broadway as the man who staged the RSC productions of `` Much Ado About Nothing'' and `` Cyrano de Bergerac,'' with <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sinead </PERSON> <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON>. It was n't until the show moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and started to rehearse again that Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> began to understand her character. `` I've just suddenly come to realize that the whole thing about <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> is that she really is quite an intelligent person,'' Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> says. `` She does n't have to be ugly and she does n't have to be awkward. She can be quite beautiful in her own way. She's just different.'' When Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> first started doing the role, she wondered how she could keep up the intense pace required by it. Now she is getting used to it. `` I take everything as it comes and even if the show is n't a success, it's still a great achievement for me and a great experience,'' Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> says. `` I listen to everybody's advice. I'm not saying that I always take it but if I listen to it all, then I can make my own decisions. I'm learning so much and so quickly. I have to.''

 On May 13, 1888, Princess Isabel of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> signed the Golden Law and 780,000 slaves went free, three centuries after blacks first came in bondage from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. A hundred years later the Brazilian government is commemorating the event with tributes to what it calls `` racial democracy.'' Blacks, however, maintain that widespread prejudice and inequality leave them little to celebrate. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> has designated May 13 a national holiday. The government, the media and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have begun nationwide campaigns aimed at portraying <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s multi-racial society as integrated. But while millions of Brazilian blacks and whites live and work side by side in apparent harmony, many here contend that `` racial democracy'' is a myth. `` Abolition of slavery here was merely a legal act. It has meant little in reality,'' said <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltrami </PERSON>, spokesman for the Brazilian Bishops council, which in the world's largest <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nation is given great importance. The Golden Law, already approved by the national legislature, was signed by Princess <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> while her father, Emperor <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, was out of the country. The 780,000 slaves joined millions of other blacks already released from bondage and they were left to fend for themselves without education, training or jobs. It happened 25 years and 134 days after <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s Emancipation Proclamation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> As the slavery issue helped set off the Civil War in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, abolition in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, without compensation to slave owners, was a factor in the ouster of <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON>'s monarchy and the establishment of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> as an republic. Today, blacks and mulattoes make up about 80 million of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 143 million people They are prominent in sports and entertainment _ among them the soccer great Pele, singer-composer <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Nascimento </PERSON> and actor-vaudevillean Grande Othello. But political leaders, army generals, corporate executives, diplomats and bishops are almost exclusively the descendants of white Portuguese colonizers or other white European immigrants. The 559-seat national <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has just seven black members. Help-wanted ads still specify that applicants should have a `` good appearance,'' meaning they should be white. Blacks are unwelcome in many restaurants, bars and upper-class apartment buildings, where doormen sometimes force them to use the service entrance. `` Blacks here are found in hillside shantytowns, working as maids or as manual laborers, in prisons and in juvenile delinquency centers,'' said <PERSON> Benedita </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first black congresswoman and a former maid. To the casual observer, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is an astonishing blend of racial types. Centuries of racial mixing, starting with the Portuguese, native Indians and then African slaves, have produced a range of skin hues and hair types that the country's Portuguese language defines in 120 different ways. Much of Brazilian culture also comes from black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including samba music, many typical national dishes such as `` feijoada'' black bean stew, cachaca sugar cane liquor, and popular voodoo-type spirit religions. President <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, in announcing the May 13 holiday, spoke of a mixed-race people `` living and growing in harmony.'' He held up <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> as a model for nations like <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. TV GLobo, the country's largest private television network, for several months has been broadcasting a public service announcement with well-known black performers and athletes wishing viewers `` Axe'' -LRB- pronounced ah-SHEH -RRB-, an African word meaning `` good luck'' and `` power.'' Another TV message sponsored by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> shows a black hand and a white hand slowly clasping while a voice says, `` Many races, one people.'' The government-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brazil </ORGANIZATION> is paying for a similar media campaign. But racial prejudice still runs deep. Paulo de <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, 18, lives with his father and four brothers and sisters in a crumbling Portuguese colonial-era house in <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a city of 1.8 million, about 1,120 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s capital in the 17th century and as the principal slave port became a center of black culture. Paulo de <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> said he does not feel discriminated against, but he added that he often is stopped, searched and asked for identification by police officers. Twice he has been arrested on `` suspicion,'' he said.

 In a recent independent survey, 309 Brazilian youngsters 7 to 18 years old were asked to look at photographs of a white and a black person and to link certain characteristics to each. The survey indicated that 82.9 percent of the children considered the black man `` stupid,'' 85.7 percent found him `` ugly'' and 84.2 percent saw him as `` a thief.'' In comparison, the percentages, respectively, for the white were 17.1, 14.3 and 15.8. In <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, a black businesswoman married to a white Swiss citizen told the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Jornal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> do </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brasil </ORGANIZATION> that when she tried to pay for dinner by check at a fashionable nightclub, the management refused to accept it, apparently in the belief the checkbook was stolen. `` They insulted me and threw me out,'' <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobrist </PERSON> told the paper. `` I called the police and ended up with the manager at the precinct station. They accepted my check only after the police chief called up my house and confirmed I was who I said I was.'' Blacks also lag behind whites in education and income. A government census showed blacks on average complete just 2.1 years of schooling, compared to 4.8 years for whites. And blacks earn 47 percent less than whites doing the same work, according to a 1985 labor union study. `` Blacks have never been integrated into <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> society as full citizens,'' said the black composer and singer <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>, who also is the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> state secretary of culture. `` We need to think about what Princess <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON>'s signature on a piece of paper actually meant for us, if anything,'' <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> added in an interview in his office in <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION>'s capital. Starting in the 1500s, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> brought in an estimated 3.6 million West Africans to work on sugar, cotton and coffee plantations and to mine gold and diamonds. The abolitionist movement grew after 1850, when the government outlawed slave trading. In 1871 the Free Womb Law declared that children born of slave mothers would be considered free. When <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> finally abolished slavery, it was the last country in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> to do so, and under sharp international censure. `` The emancipation actually took the wind out of a growing abolitionist movement. Maybe our lives would be different if the law had not been signed just then,'' said the black historian and activist <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON>. He suggested <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> could have taken more time to prepare blacks for citizenship. But the documentary history of slavery in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> was virtually erased in 1891 when Finance Minister <PERSON> Ruy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> had the records of slave trade burned on grounds that the country should look ahead and forget its `` African'' past. Possibly because of that, black consciousness today is dim and black pride almost non-existent. Few black rights groups or activists exist. Many mixed-race Brazilians seek to appear whiter and climb the social ladder. `` There is no such thing as ` black' here,'' said <PERSON> Januario </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> on Black Culture in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. `` People use any word but black to define themselves. They want to be as white as possible.'' Still, in this centennial year, awareness of discrimination is growing. At <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>'s famous pre-Lenten Carnival parades this past February, many of the poor, mostly black groups competing for prizes with floats and samba music chose racism as their themes, rather than the usual folklore motifs. The champion group, <PERSON> Vila </PERSON> <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON>, offered a tribute to <PERSON> Zumbi </PERSON>, leader of a 17th century slave revolt and a hideaway for runaway slaves. The runnerup was the <LOCATION> Mangueira </LOCATION> school, which sang of blacks `` free from the master's whip, but trapped in the slums.'' Many black groups said they do n't intend to celebrate the May 13 holiday but planned festivities for Nov. 20. That is the anniversary of the death of <PERSON> Zumbi </PERSON>, killed in 1695 by <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> troops who defended slave owners. `` We need to celebrate black strength, not a gift from white men,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The severed heads of a school principal and a journalist were left hanging in plastic bags in a town square set among lovely, wooded hills. Their foreheads were smeared with vermilion _ a Gurkha mark of revenge. The killings in April were among the most brutal in the two-year campaign by Gurkhas, famed as soldiers in the British and Indian armies, for the creation of a separate Indian state called <LOCATION> Gurkhaland </LOCATION> around this once-tranquil vacation retreat. <PERSON> Subash </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghising </PERSON>, 52-year-old leader of the <LOCATION> Gurkha </LOCATION> agitation, has been negotiating with Indian government officials, but in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he seemed in no mood to compromise. `` We want blood for blood, an eye for an eye, and we will settle for nothing less than a homeland for the Gurkhas,'' he said at his well-guarded headquarters in Darjeeling, which also is famous for its tea. So far, Ghising's repeated trips to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> have swayed Indian officials to offer the <LOCATION> Gurkha </LOCATION> area some governmental power and development funds, but not to make it <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 26th state. The killing goes on, with at least 275 deaths recorded since the agitation started in April 1986. Some officials of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state, which now governs the area, say privately the dispute has the potential to lead to more dangerous demands for a separate country, as militant Sikhs have done in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. The Gurkhas, who are Indians of Nepalese descent, want 2,250 square miles around Darjeeling, an area slightly larger than <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, as a Gurkha state within <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. They say their hilly homeland is different from the flatlands around the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, and that they are ethnically distinct from the Bengalis The Gurkhas say about 1.4 million Gurkha people live around Darjeeling and 4.6 million live elsewhere in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. They first came here in the 1850s to make their way as soldiers or as workers on tea plantations. Ghising, a former army corporal, teacher and bantamweight boxer, says government force can only aggravate the problem. `` By provoking us, by killing or wounding our men, the government is creating wounded tigers,'' he said. `` You know what a wounded tiger does? It hunts for men and devours them.'' Nowadays, only police officers are seen at night outside the quaint, old houses built by the British who developed Darjeeling as a `` hill station.'' Fears have worsened since April 6 when school principal <PERSON> Dileswar </PERSON> <PERSON> Rai </PERSON>'s severed head was found in <LOCATION> Kalimpong </LOCATION>, 43 miles east of Darjeeling. He had kept his school open during a general strike called by Gurkha militants. The severed head of <PERSON> Nirmal </PERSON> <PERSON> Rai </PERSON>, a reporter for a local newspaper, was found at the same place April 12. The journalist, who was not related to the principal, was accused of being a police informer. The government's response to the violence has been building up a force of more than 4,000 security forces and paramilitary police who often open fire with mortars and machine guns. `` We are fighting a very well entrenched enemy and the terrain is in their favor,'' said <PERSON> Raj </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanojia </PERSON>, a police superintendent in charge of anti-insurgency operations. Amid the violence, the tea and tourist trades are suffering. A backlash by Marxist-controlled unions has forced 30,000 Gurkha laborers to flee from tea estates to refugee camps in Darjeeling and the adjoining state of <LOCATION> Sikkim </LOCATION>. Gurkha insurgents have felled at least 2,000 pine trees to block roads. More than 600 homes have been burned by insurgents or Marxists who support the <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION> government. More than 250 government buildings have been set ablaze, including two stations of the `` Toy Train,'' built in 1879 by the British and so called for its tiny cars and narrow-gauge track. The Gurkha campaign also has triggered fears for the security of the seven strategically important northeastern states near <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, with whom <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has a long-standing border dispute. The northeast, an area about the size of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, is connected to the main part of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> by a narrow land corridor called the <LOCATION> Siliguri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION> in the envisoned <LOCATION> Gurkhaland </LOCATION>. Ghising, the Gurkha leader, now brushed aside the question of secession. `` We are Indians and we will remain Indians,'' he said. But Ghising, who also is the author of more than 20 racy, potboiler novels in the Nepali language, made it clear he is not going to give in without achieving his goals. He sits in an office guarded by tough-looking <PERSON> Gurkas </PERSON> with their traditonal curved, 14-inch kukri knives. Behind him is a green <LOCATION> Gurkhaland </LOCATION> flag emblazoned with a kukri and three stars. He reeled off his demands: _ Recognition of Nepali as an official Indian language _ More government jobs for Gurkhas _ Better education and more industry `` If we do not get statehood for <LOCATION> Gurkhaland </LOCATION>, the Indian government will regret it,'' he added. `` They have seen only a flash of Gurkha retaliation, Gurkha courage, Gurkha dedication, but if we are pushed, we will start a full scale, non-stop retaliation.'' About 48,000 retired Gurkha soldiers live in Darjeeling, and Indian officials fear they could join <PERSON> Ghising </PERSON>'s campaign. Above the town, a giant graffiti painted on a mountain slope shows blood dripping from a kukri knife. Below it reads: `` Welcome to <LOCATION> Gurkhaland </LOCATION>.''

 The killing goes on as it has for six years and the prospects for peace talks have grown slimmer in the war waged by Sikh militants for an autonomous homeland in the Indian state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. In an apparent move to open peace talks, Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> freed a radical Sikh priest from jail, but then he said he would talk only within the framework of the Indian Constitution. The militants responded that they will not negotiate until the government accepts their demand for the independent Sikh nation of <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>, a concept that is very much outside the Consititution. `` We will continue tofight in the same manner until we get Khalistan,'' said <PERSON> Jagir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Panthic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, an underground umbrella grouping of militant Sikh groups. `` It is not a demand,'' he said in an interview. `` It is our right.'' Sikhs make up 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people but are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Sikh militants claim they are being subjugated by Hindus, who form 80 percent of the population. The Sikh agitation has claimed at least 735 lives this year and the violence has worsened recently. More than 350 people have been killed in the six weeks since <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> freed the radical Sikh priest <PERSON> Jasbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rode </PERSON> from jail. The killings blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> militias have raised fears that the government would turn a harsher face toward <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. At the same time the priest was freed, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> pushed through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> a bill that would allow the government to clamp emergency rule on <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, severely limiting individual rights. <PERSON> Jagir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was asked in the interview if he expected a government move to drive out the radicals who have taken refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> holy place in <LOCATION> Amitsar </LOCATION>. `` We are ready for an attack,'' he said. He characterized the militants' attitude with a <LOCATION> Punjabi </LOCATION> proverb: `` A brick will be replied to with a stone.'' Indian officials seek to play down the possibility of a raid on the temple. An army raid in 1984 left more than 1,200 people dead, most of them Sikhs, and the desecration of the shrine angered the entire Sikh community. Five months later, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s mother, was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards in an act of revenge. Police officers in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> see little hope that conciliatory moves by the government would end the violence. `` These people kill nearly 10 people every day,'' said <PERSON> Izhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alam </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district police superintendent. `` We must take strong action.'' He added this should include sending security forces into the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, where about 100 armed militants are believed to have taken shelter. <PERSON> Alam </PERSON> also said police alone could not raid the temple complex. `` Other forces will have to be included,'' he said. `` The militants have AK-47 automatic rifles and carbines. All we -LRB- the police -RRB- have is .303 rifles and pistols.'' The biggest impediment to any plan to raid the militants' sanctuary is a threat held out by <PERSON> Rode </PERSON>, the freed priest `` If the government enters the temple, they will be laying the foundation for <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>,'' Rode said. He spoke at a meeting April 13 of about 40,000 Sikhs in south <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. It was his first major appearance since his release and there were reports he would encourage moderation among the militants and that a peaceful approach would come from the meeting. But most speakers urged more agitation. While Rode did not directly support moves for <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>, he called for continuing a movement to `` free Sikhs from the bonds of slavery.'' `` His demands are the same as ours,'' <PERSON> Jagir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said a day later. Rode, named to the most influential Sikh religious post shortly after his release, denies entering into any deals with authorities. He says the only way for a solution is for the government to talk directly to the Sikh militants. Even moderate Sikhs believe the government should make the first move for peace, such as freeing hundreds of Sikh youths jailed as suspected militants. <PERSON> Devinder </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a farmer at the mass meeting of Sikhs, said the government first has to prove it wants a settlement. `` People in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> distrust the government,'' he said. `` We have been let down too many times. Let them offer something first.''

 Makeshift Buddhist pagodas dot the jungle across the border from here in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. But the rumble of military vehicles and, sometimes, bursts of gunfire shatter the tranquil setting, reminders that a little-known bush war that began 11 years ago still rages. The hymns of monks are silenced as terror flashes through the refugee camps filled with Chakma tribespeople on this side of the border. The Chakmas, descendants of the warlike <ORGANIZATION> Mongols </ORGANIZATION> who once surged across <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, are fighting the <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> government to hold onto their land, their <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> religion and their age-old customs against an influx of Moslem settlers. Chakma guerrilla leaders say at least 4,000 people have died in the cycle of killings and bloody reprisals since the Chakmas took up arms in May 1977 and killed 40 <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> policemen in their first ambush. The battle is vicious, unequal, unremitting and rarely reported. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> seldom allows foreign reporters to visit the Chakmas' ancestral homeland in the <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> Tracts <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> does not permit foreign journalists to travel to its border states housing the refugees, but Indian reporters can make the trip with police permission. The <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> Tracts, which roll over 5,138 square miles in southern <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, border <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and the northeastern Indian states of <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Belonia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> is the region in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION> state that faces the <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> Tracts. In camouflage uniforms of war, <LOCATION> Bangladeshi </LOCATION> soldiers move from village to village in the deep woods and jungles of the hill tracts, often firing at random to frighten away the Chakmas, sometimes to kill them, said <PERSON> Bakul </PERSON> <PERSON> Chakma </PERSON>, a refugee at the <LOCATION> Takumbari </LOCATION> camp 10 miles from the border. The battle, often fought at midnight on jungle paths traveled by elephants and reptiles, pits 20,000 Bangladeshi soldiers and 40,000 paramilitary troops and policemen against 4,000 guerrillas. In the past two years, more than 50,000 tribespeople have fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION> state to avoid the fighting. `` We tried enough persuasion. When nothing worked, we took up arms,'' said <PERSON> Priti </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chakma </PERSON>, a leader of the tribespeople's `` <PERSON> Shanti </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahini </PERSON>,'' or Army for Peace `` What option do we have other than killing those who want to finish us?'' the 41-year-old guerrilla said in an interview arranged on condition the location not be disclosed. In 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights organization, said it had received `` increasing reports of arbitrary arrests, torture and extrajudicial executions'' of tribespeople in the <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> Tracts by Bangladeshi troops. President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s government in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> has denied the allegations. It says it wants to develop the area and has pledged the local currency equivalent of $ 90 million to help tribesmen come down from the hills and join mainstream society. Islam is the official religion of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, and about 80 percent of its 105 million people are Moslems. The remainder are Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s government in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, about 200 miles northwest of the hill tracts, says it is absurd for the Chakmas to demand 11 percent of the land in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> when they make up less than 0.5 percent percent of the population. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> is one of the world's most densely populated nations. Most of the 600,000 tribespeople in the <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> Tracts are Chakmas. The others are Mogs and Tripuraies. So far about 300,000 Moslems have settled in the area and thousands of Chakmas have been evicted from their homes in the deep woods and moved to what the <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> government calls `` ideal villages.'' `` The so-called ideal villages are nothing but concentration camps,'' charged <PERSON> Bimal </PERSON> <PERSON> Larma </PERSON>, a Chakma guerrilla. In addition to land, the Chakmas are demanding autonomy, but this has been rejected by the government. The tribespeople, who speak a mixture of Tibetan-Burmese dialects, fear they will become a minority in the hills where they have lived for centuries. Their political wing, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, charges that some tribespeople have been forcibly converted to Islam and that Moslem settlers are encouraged to marry <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> girls. `` We have no similarities at all with the Moslems,'' said refugee <PERSON> Ranjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON>. `` We love pork; they despise it. We worship <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>; they follow Islam. Unless forced, we do not kill, but they kill us at the slightest provocation.'' <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON>, 54, fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1986 with his wife, four sons and a daughter. `` I have seen my neighboring villages being burned, women raped and men killed. I told my wife, ` We ca n't stay here anymore. Let us go.''' he said. They walked four days to reach <PERSON> Takumbari </PERSON>, the largest of seven refugee camps in <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION>. The camps, which house 50,586 refugees, have no electricity. The houses are made of bamboo and roofed with dry leaves. Since <PERSON> Takumbari </PERSON> was set up two years ago, it's population has swollen to 15,510. In that time, 546 people have died of disease and 549 children have been born. The Indian government gives each adult and teen-ager a daily ration of 14 ounces of rice and about two ounces each a day of lentils and dry fish, plus 20 paise -LRB- about one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cent -RRB-. Children under 12 get half-rations. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> of aiding the Chakma rebels. `` This is absurd. We have enough problems of our own,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tripura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> said. `` We are helping the Chakmas on purely humanitarian grounds. `` We can not push them back, it would mean certain death for them.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Zelly and Me''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Once upon a time in Hollywood the `` woman's picture'' held sway. <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women flocked to matinees and sobbed and sympathized with the plight of such stars as <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON>. No more. Movie matinees are largely populated by small fry and weary shoppers in malls. `` Zelly and Me'' arrives a few decades late. It is patently a woman's picture: the writer-director, co-producer and leading performers are women. However, despite the best performance yet by <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON>, the film can not escape a pervading preciousness, and its chances of finding a wide audience of both sexes seem slender indeed. The Zelly of the title is <PERSON> Mademoiselle </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON> -RRB-, the European nanny whose life is devoted to her young charge, the orphaned <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> -RRB-. They live in a mansion presided over by <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON>'s autocratic grandmother, Coco -LRB- <PERSON> Glynis </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> -RRB-. Zelly and <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON> occupy a fantasy world of stuffed animals, all with special names and identities, and they share a devotion to the legend of <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> of Arc -LRB- filmgoers will recall that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, portrayed <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> of Arc on the screen -RRB- For reasons that are n't quite clear, <PERSON> Coco </PERSON> punishes the child for faultless infractions. The punishments become more severe, even sadistic. <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON>, whose parents were killed in a fiery plane crash, burns herself in retaliation. The nanny helplessly watches <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON>'s torment, finding solace only in day-off meetings with the neighbor in another mansion -LRB- <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> -RRB-. When Zelly is fired by the enraged grandmother, the pair dream up a scheme to spirit away <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON>. The conclusion brings happiness to no one. `` Zelly and Me'' is the first feature film by <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathborne </PERSON>, and it appears at least partly autobiographical. Her attention to the details of girlhood becomes almost unbearably cloying, and only in the latter portions does the film gain any momentum. Within the confines of a largely ineffectual role, <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON> performs with an inner radiance hauntingly like her mother's. <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>, absent too long from the screen, is effective in a seemingly unrewarding role. <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> is a gifted young actress, fully capable of occupying the screen by herself. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, director of `` Blue Velvet,'' makes his acting debut as the neighbor who is not what he seems. He seems stiff in the role, needful of the direction of, say, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> release was produced by <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>. The rating is PG; small children might be frightened by the girl's punishment. Running time: 87 minutes.

 <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION> _ At the start of `` Weeds,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Umstetter </PERSON>, doing a life sentence for armed robbery, attempts suicide twice _ once by leaping from his cell block at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION>, and once by a crude attempt at hanging himself. `` Depressed, are you?'' asks his cell mate. `` Well, I needed a little vacation,'' replies the droll <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON>. That's about as deep as the explanations get in `` Weeds,'' a flat, humorless film based on a play by a real-life ex-con who, like <PERSON> Umstetter </PERSON>, was confined to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state penitentiary. In the film, <PERSON> Umstetter </PERSON> decides to channel his rage and frustration into creativity. With only a 6th grade education, he reads <PERSON> Dostoevski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON>, Nietszche and <PERSON> Genet </PERSON>. Borrowing a bit too liberally from his readings, he writes a play about prison life called `` Weeds.'' It's produced in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> and, unaccountably, there happens to be a rich, beautiful critic in the audience named <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Binghamton </PERSON>. Equally unaccountably, eyes meet and, presto, it's amore. <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, writes a rave review and campaigns successfully to free her new-found love from prison. It turns out, though, she is n't much of a critic since she failed to perceive that the play is largely plagiarized. Later in the movie, she catches <PERSON> Umstetter </PERSON> in bed with a younger woman. There's a touch of chagrin from this person who has freed her lover from a life in prison. But in a moment or so, it's forgotten <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON>, in short, is incredibly dimwitted. The movie winds on episodically, with <PERSON> Umstetter </PERSON> forming a traveling acting troupe made up of his old jail buddies. They take it on the road, finally making it to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> drama critic takes the wind temporarily out of their sails. But by this time the play is not the counterfeit it started out to be. It's so real, in fact, that they produce it in a prison and cause a riot. Presto! Instant headlines and fame, and the bright lights of <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. Sure. Right. `` Weeds'' is rated `` R'' for strong prison language and some nudity. _ By <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> Education Writer.

 `` House of Games'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, VHS @ Beta, $ 89.99, Rated R -RRB- `` House of Games'' is set in the seedy underworld of con artists, and the movie is _ deliberately _ something of a con itself. Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>, who wrote and directed this 1980's film noir, repeatedly confounds the viewer by staging increasingly elaborate confidence games. It's often difficult to be sure who's conning whom, and that's what makes the movie such creepy fun. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouse </PERSON> plays Dr. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, a psychiatrist who has just made a lot of money writing a book but who is clearly unhappy, maybe even clinically depressed. On an impulse, she decides to help a patient who is a compulsive gambler and visits the House of Games where she encounters <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, the ringleader of the con artists, played by <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON>. She is strongly attracted to <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and also to the excitement of his dangerous profession. In a series of plot twists she moves from victim to accomplice to aggressor, drawn ever deeper into a web of deceit that seems certain eventually to destroy her. <PERSON> Crouse </PERSON>, who is married to <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>, is fascinating in a role tailor-made for her, while <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON> has just the right oily charm for his part. All in all, `` House of Games'' is an original, diverting film and well worth a look for those who missed it in theaters last year. _ By <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Hairspray'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ various artists. `` Dirty Dancing'' -LRB- RCA -RRB- _ various artists. `` More Dirty Dancing'' -LRB- RCA -RRB- _ various artists. `` Do You Love Me?'' by the Contours is one of peaks of rock' n' roll, matching depth of anxiety to banality of lyric in the finest tradition of the Clearasil generation `` You broke my heart,'cause I could n't dance ...'' Ah, what a world of pain recalled. Then there's that trick fade, before the Contours come booming back _ `` Work! Work!'' _ in an ecstatic finale. Great as it is, `` Do You Love Me?'' does n't rescue the `` Dirty Dancing'' soundtrack albums from the contempt of all prudent consumers. RCA has spread this collection on two compact discs, giving as little as 35 minutes of retread listening in a format that would hold twice as much. So they're charging $ 25 or more for what is essentially a $ 2 record in the oldies bin. The real sin, though, is the mixture of old and new. Oldies, as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON> says, are `` the only known remedy to today's Hit Parade of Hell.'' The soundtrack collection from Waters' first mainstream film, `` Hairspray,'' is the better buy. The title track, despite its satirical intent, is absolutely faithful to the old sound. But again, the exasperated consumer wonders, why no instructions for dancing the <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> along with `` The Madison Time'' by The <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Combo </PERSON>? Through such indifference, the old tribal wisdom is in danger of being lost. _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Naked'' -LRB- Sire -RRB- _ Talking Heads Too often on `` Naked,'' it's impossible even to guess what the Talking Heads are talking about. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s oblique lyrics are frustrating because there are snatches of wonderful imagery that leave the listener begging for more details. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s eccentricity probably is n't the only reason it's hard to find a plot in `` Naked.'' The Talking Heads recorded the basic tracks before <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> began to work on the tune or words, reducing his flexibility as a composer. But while the record's melodies and lyrics are less than fluid, rhythmically `` Naked'' is a marvel _ so lively it would make even <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> want to dance. The Talking Heads brought in studio musicians to create a denser sound than on their last two records. As a result, instruments dart in and out of the arrangements, almost always serving to enhance the syncopation. The band and its co-producer, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Lillywhite </PERSON>, achieved a full but remarkably clean sound. Most momentous is the satirical `` -LRB- Nothing But -RRB- Flowers,'' in which <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> provides a fresh perspective on urban sprawl by describing with mock horror a place where `` highways and cars were sacrificed for agriculture.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>'' and `` Totally Nude'' are also made for the dance floor, while the best of the slower songs is the darkly melodic `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>,'' about a fat man, a little girl and a gun. What happens? We do n't know. The song, like too much of `` Naked,'' is clothed in ambiguity. _ By <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Tracy Chapman'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Elektra </ORGANIZATION> @ Asylum -RRB- _ <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> One of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s best kept secrets was a young poet-songwriter-folksinger named <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. Not any more. With the release of her self-titled debut LP the world has a new musical gift. Her rich contralto with its melancholic underpinnings sweep us back to the early 1970s _ to <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. Her lyrics, with a deadbolt look at poverty, racism and inequality take us back even further _ to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Odetta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON>. The LP opens with `` Talkin' Bout a Revolution,'' a song that tells of `` standing in the welfare lines, crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation, wasting time in the unemployment lines, sitting around waiting for a promotion.'' The a cappella `` Behind the Wall,'' talks of a domestic fight: `` Last night I heard the screaming, then a silence that chilled my soul.'' As an undergraduate at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> performed in coffee houses and clubs. She was something of a mesmerizing hit for locals who flocked to hear her.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, a favorite whipping boy of the scandal tabloids, does n't think he's that bad. `` When I've been talking to people about this film -LRB- ` Sunset' -RRB-, I find them so surprised to see that I'm this calm and that I'm not throwing chairs and swinging from the rafters,'' he said. `` They're pretty surprised that I can be this relaxed. Indeed, he was relaxed as he lounged beside the swimming pool on a sunswept morning at the beachfront home he shares with his wife, actress <PERSON> Demi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. After three frantic years of doing TV's `` Moonlighting'' and three feature movies, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> is unaccustomed to the leisure that has been enforced by the screenwriters' strike. Like most television series, `` Moonlighting'' has shut down for lack of scripts. The actor wore only swim trunks and a cap marked <ORGANIZATION> Newark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> _ `` a small firm that will some day package my films; the name is an homage to my beginnings in the Garden State -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' He looked trim, healthy _ and relaxed. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> has been doing interviews for `` Sunset,'' <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' Hollywood period piece in which <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mix </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Earp </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> -RRB- pursue a murder scandal <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> interviews have been rare in recent times. `` My wife has helped me in dealing with the matter of publicity,'' he said. `` It just sells more magazines to say I'm the Bad Boy of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> than to say that I'm not doing anything this week, or I'm not throwing any wild parties. `` By and large, the basic principle was that if you put my picture on the cover of a magazine, people were going to buy it. I sell magazines. I had to realize that if you took all those people out of that industry, next week a whole new crowd would come in. Because somebody's got to do that job.'' Becoming a husband and future father appears to have had a salutary influence on <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, also the stimulus of working with veterans <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> in a top-flight production. `` The work I had done in television was basically a two-character show,'' he said. `` The film ` Blind Date' was basically a two-character love story. I had wanted to work in an ensemble situation with a large cast. The feel on ` Sunset' was the closest I've come to working on stage since I've come out here. `` I came on the film three weeks late, because I was finishing up the season on ` Moonlighting.' When I arrived, everyone else had been working on their characters and were into that genre. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> especially made it very comfortable for me. We hit it off right away, and I had never met him before.'' There's further evidence of <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>' domestication: He is into gardening. `` I'm having a lot of trouble with snails,'' he complained as he proudly displayed a tiny bed of marigolds and snapdragons. His interest in gardening, he explained, harks back to his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> childhood. `` Everyone associates <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> with going on the turnpike through <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> and that area,'' he said. `` Where I grew up in south <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Carneys </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> -RRB- it's very beautiful. `` I really grew up out of doors. The majority of my first 16-17 years were outside, which I really did n't appreciate then. As a kid I always wanted to live in a larger city. Now that I'm older, those are the memories I have: climbing trees and being in the woods.'' <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, 33, spent a few years at <ORGANIZATION> Montclair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, where he studied drama under <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockwood </PERSON>. In 1977, he moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and began a life of hunting work as an actor and tending bar. `` I still remember when $ 20 was a lot of money,'' he reminisced. `` I could eat for three or four days on $ 20. Of course my diet in those days was pretty much pizza and beer. In some some ways things were a lot simpler then. There was only one thing to do: get a job. Then I did n't have to think about anything else _ as long as the show ran. `` Once I had a structured job for six months. I fell in love with a girl, and she needed more security in our relationship. I was anything but financially secure. So I took a job managing a health club and became the director. The relationship fell apart and I went back to hunting for acting jobs.'' His luck began to change when he starred in <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s `` Fool for Love.'' When he was passed over for a role in `` Desperately Seeking <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> took a trip to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and soon was tapped for `` Moonlighting.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> series co-starring <PERSON> Cybill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> as an odd couple of private eyes had a sensational two years. It recently has been lambasted by critics and fans for constant reruns. `` I think we went through a rough time,'' <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. `` Cybill was off the show having her babies. We really missed having her there; she brings a lot to the show. Not having her was like watching the Three Stooges with only one Stooge.'' He still enjoys doing the show, he said. `` I'll stay as long as it remains creative. ... The medium of television itself has worn pretty thin for me. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has been very generous with expenses, but there are only so many shots you can do, so many ways to approach a scene. After my experiences in film, I find myself leaning more towards that.''

 The singing of whales, the howl of wolves and the trilling of a Grand Canyon wren filled the 800-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in the university city of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>. It was a new kind of music for the venerable <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> building, within the walls of <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. When the six casually dressed American musicians recently emulated the sounds of the wild on drums and tambourine, the audience was so intrigued they got up from their seats to look over the choir rails. From among the medieval tombs came music that `` celebrates the environment,'' as band leader <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> described it. Winter, who lives in <LOCATION> Litchfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, calls the animals and birds whose sounds he incorporates in his group's compositions, `` our members at large. The Paul Winter Consort combines classical jazz and folk instruments drawn from the European and African roots of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> culture. The result is daring, fascinating and never dull. `` I have never heard anything which was so unexpected and so charming at the same time,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> teacher who wandered into the concert without being invited. The group played in the cathedral for participants from 60 countries at a conference of religious leaders and legislators discussing how they can use their influence to help solve problems of the planet, from the threat of nuclear war to pollution and poverty. `` I can feel his music; it's not just something to listen to,'' said <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON>, a business consultant from <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, who was helping to run the conference. The two-hour concert ended with Winter putting out the lights and inviting the audience to howl like the wolves. They did. `` It breaks the ice,'' he said with a smile. Winter and his group are artists-in-residence at the Cathedral of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Divine in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, whose Dean <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> was co-chairman of the conference and invited the group to <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Halley </PERSON>, the group's pianist, is the cathedral organist and music director. Winter plays soprano saxophone, <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> plays flute, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Friesen </PERSON> plays the cello and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Velez </PERSON> are the percussionists. Winter said in an interview he was first inspired to put animal sounds in his music when he heard recordings 20 years ago of whale songs made off the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. He and his musicians have played in 33 countries and made 10 visits to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where they toured wilderness areas. `` I think the only composer who imitated natural sounds before us is the Frenchman, <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Messiaen </PERSON>, who notated the songs of all French birds,'' Winter said. Thanks to <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>'s enthusiasm for the arts, the <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> conference had the rare treat of an arts program to itself, with music, songs and sculpture. It was coordinated by <PERSON> Naj </PERSON> <PERSON> Wikoff </PERSON>, a 38-year-old sculptor who presents more than 200 drama, dance, music and poetry performances a year at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Divine. The conference had its own anthem, a 2 -LCB- piece called, `` Alpha Code: The Beginning,'' composed by American concert pianist <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Janis </PERSON>. `` The conference is every man's struggle,'' <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> said. `` The music starts with a prayer, then an SOS, and then the prayer is taken up by more and more people and becomes an expression of triumph over the problems. `` I call it a response to a distress signal from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, because that's what the conference is about.'' <PERSON> Wikoff </PERSON> said no one should see anything unusual in a conference grappling with global crises listening to music. `` Arts celebrate the human spirit and always have done,'' he said. `` The arts transcend society. People need not only food and a bed but a sense of hope and beauty.''

 Her confessional lyrics were set to long, winding melodies and described loves past and present, and the shadowy thoughts a woman might have in the confines of her room at night. But after a 20-year career, <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s latest album, `` Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm,'' shows the Canadian singer's evolution into a tougher, more issue-oriented chronicler of the era `` These are troubled times,'' said the 44-year-old troubadour, born in the prairie town of Ft.. <PERSON> Macleod </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, and now living in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> `` I think my main function is to try to articulate what it is to live in these times ... to be a scribe or witness to my times. It's fairly neutral reporting. For her 15th album, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and her bassist-husband <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> co-produce 10 songs on such topics as the Vietnam War, commercialism, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and the plight of Hopi Indians. The project builds on the social commentary <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> introduced in her last album in 1985, `` Dog Eat Dog,'' which contained a savage attack on TV evangelists and addressed the famine in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Recorded in nine different studios in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, `` Chalk Mark'' includes contributions from <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Idol </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> and American Indian actor Iron Eyes Cody. It is the most ambitious list of guests on a <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> album to date. One powerful song, `` The Beat of <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION>,'' was recorded at <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>'s Ashcombe House studio in Bath, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, near the air base from where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombers took off for the 1986 foray on Libyan targets. `` It was very close and it occurred to all of us that should there be a retaliation, we were on target,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. The Soviet nuclear accident at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> occurred around the same time, and `` all of our thinking turned to war and how small the planet was. Suddenly, the globe seems so small and we all seem so fragile.'' Her long, blond hair spilling from under a broad-brimmed black hat, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was relaxed and chatty, and the new album reflects her less introspective personality with a light-hearted rocker, `` Dancing' Clown,'' and a lazily-paced rendition of the old <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> favorite, `` Cool Water.'' `` It's not an autobiographical album particularly,'' she said. `` I do n't live there anymore.'' Born <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the skinny young folksinger from the prairies was fresh from art school when she hit the coffee houses of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yorkville </LOCATION> district a quarter of a century ago. She worked in the women's wear section of a downtown department store to pay the rent. After a brief marriage to folkie <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, she moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where her sinuous melodies and soul-baring lyrics attracted <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON> to record two of her songs, `` Both Sides Now'' and `` The Circle Game.'' With a quavering voice as individual as her song-poems, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> soon emerged in her own right with classics such as `` Big Yellow Taxi,'' `` <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>'' and `` Help Me.'' Yet despite a devoted following, she never quite won the acclaim of a <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baez </PERSON> or <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, especially after experimenting with jazz in albums such as `` The Hissing of Summer Lawns'' which <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> magazine rated the worst record of 1975. On the other hand, the late jazz great <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mingus </PERSON> liked <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Juan </PERSON>'s Reckless Daughter'' so much that, knowing he was dying, he invited her to collaborate on his last six songs and the result was `` Mingus'' in 1979. Future goals, she said, include working with jazz trumpeter <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. All of <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s albums feature her imaginative paintings and designs, and she is now marketing her work after discovering that limited editions handed out by record companies were selling privately for large sums. `` It would be nice to have the luxury to do nothing else. It's hard to have two careers,'' she said Asked to define her contribution to the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> generation, she said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> was the prophet while she `` chicken-scratched'' for immortality. `` I wo n't be remembered for the best of my material,'' she lamented, listing her own favorites as `` Furry Sings the Blues'' and `` Song for Sharon'' from the 1976 album `` Hejira,'' and `` Car on a Hill'' from `` Court and Spark'' of 1974. `` That would make a great golden oldie,'' she said of the latter.

 This city, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Algren </PERSON> once said, `` has literally become my trade.'' <PERSON> Algren </PERSON>, the winner of the first National Book Award, lived among the ethnic patches of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, bringing to life the roar of the elevated trains and recording, in his mind and in notebooks, the travails of the people. He hung out in the police precincts, seedy bars and brothels. Drug addicts, gamblers and migrant workers had his ear. The night often was his turf and his fiction breathed the night. `` It is n't hard to love a town for its greater and its lesser towers,'' <PERSON> Algren </PERSON> wrote. `` But you never truly love it till you can love its alleys, too.'' The city he loved did n't always return the sentiment. Poles, offended with his sketches of the city's underbelly in `` Never Come Morning,'' pressured some library branches to keep the book out of circulation, <PERSON> Algren </PERSON> and his literary companions maintained. But today, seven years after he died at age 72 in <LOCATION> Sag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, there's a romance brewing and it might finally stick. A large exhibition room at the library's downtown Cultural Center is the setting for `` Writing in the First Person: <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Algren </PERSON>,'' a rich tribute to a master of urban realism. First edition books and original manuscripts are paired with <PERSON> Algren </PERSON>'s first stabs at writing, including handwritten short stories, a mock newspaper's front page and summaries of neighborhood baseball games. His Army draft card is displayed with his honorable discharge, as well as his <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> birth certificate _ March 28, 1909 _ and papers showing his name change from <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlgren </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> to <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Algren </PERSON>. Pictures and personal letters document his affair with French philosopher <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvoir </PERSON> who accompanied him on trips down the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and to other countries. <PERSON> Algren </PERSON> admired <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> and the affection was mutual. `` You should not read it unless you can take a punch,'' <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> says in a well-worn letter, offering his endorsement for an upcoming book. `` Mr. <PERSON> Algren </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> wrote, `` boy, you are good.'' The exhibit, which opened in late February, was scheduled to run through May 21 but has been extended for three weeks. Most of the items were purchased from local collectors or are on loan from <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which has the largest Algren archive. Besides the exhibit, there also have been public readings. Hundreds turned out to hear Pulitzer Prize winner <PERSON> Studs </PERSON> <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON>, another product of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s literary school of realism and a close friend of <PERSON> Algren </PERSON>, read from <PERSON> Algren </PERSON>'s books, including the poetic `` <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, City on the Make.'' `` He was a wheel on fire,'' <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON> recalled in a interview. `` I like the idea that he was honored. It's time he was given his place.'' <PERSON> Algren </PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> when he was 3, graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> with a journalism degree in 1931. His first published works, mostly short stories, stemmed from his experiences in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> where he traveled by freight train after college. <PERSON> Algren </PERSON> said he once wandered into a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> college and began typing a story on an unattended typewriter. He decided to take the typewriter with him to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to finish the story, but was arrested for theft and served five months in jail. Back in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, he was an editor for the Works Progress Administration from 1936-40. Finally, `` Never Come Morning,'' about a Polish prizefighter tagged with a murder charge, was published in 1942. It was a book that rankled Polish civic groups for its gritty descriptions of life in their <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> neighborhoods. `` He was never a coffee table man,'' <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Algren </PERSON>'s books. In 1947, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and Letters awarded him $ 1,000 in recognition for `` Never Come Morning,'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> granted him $ 1,000 to work on a new novel _ arguably his best _ `` The Man With the Golden Arm.'' <PERSON> Algren </PERSON> received the first National Book Award in 1950 for `` The Man With the Golden Arm,'' a harrowing tale about <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Machine </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> card dealer, back from the war with a `` 35-pound monkey on his back'' _ morphine addiction. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Preminger </PERSON> made the book into a movie starring <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Preminger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Algren </PERSON> fought fiercely over the production and the bitter <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> experience was one the author would never forget. Another book, `` A Walk on the Wild Side,'' also was transferred to the big screen starring <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>. He had his detractors. Conservative critics hit <PERSON> Algren </PERSON> for what they considered his penchant for glorifying hustlers, hookers and hobos. One once dismissed him as the `` bard of the stumblebum.'' `` Academics, the English departments, had become the arbiters of literature,'' <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> was never one who was in their favor. He sort of put them down and they knew it. They reciprocated by making him a nonperson. Now he's pretty much a person and that's kind of good. By the early 1970s, <PERSON> Algren </PERSON> had traveled to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, writing dispatches for magazines and developing more books. At the same time, his ties to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> began to diminish. In 1973, he left for good. But anyone who 12 years earlier had read his afterword to `` <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, City on the Make'' could have predicted the move. The city that was once a writer's town, he said, was becoming just another town. `` <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has progressed, culturally, from being The Second City to being The Second-Hand City,'' he wrote. `` The vital cog in our culture now is not the artist, but the middleman whose commercial status lends art the aura of status when he acquires a collection of originals. `` The word ` culture' now means nothing more than ` approved.' It is n't what is exhibited so much that matters as where: that being where one meets the people who matter.'' <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON> tried to explain: `` To love a city, you have to smack it around, too. It was the ambivalent feeling he had.'' <PERSON> Algren </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to cover the murder case of boxer <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> `` Hurricane'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. A novel based on the case, `` The Devil's Stocking,'' was published posthumously in 1983. He settled in <LOCATION> Sag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and died, relatively poor, a few weeks before his May 1981 induction into the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and Letters. Money was an irritating subject to <PERSON> Algren </PERSON>. Authors with less talent were wealthy, he complained, and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producers reaped millions without spreading the credit to creators. But in an interview published in 1964, <PERSON> Algren </PERSON> seemed to suggest that writing good fiction, not collecting cash, was his goal. `` I think anybody, anybody, if given the choice, would always take the privilege of having his work wanted by other people rather than the privilege of having more money than anybody.''

 It's 2 a.m., and your baby is crying and wo n't sleep. What to do? Play the Beatles, of course, and within 15 minutes a hard day's night becomes much easier. Award-winning pianist <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Domino </PERSON> has turned the music of the Fab Four into an album of lullabies designed to send bawling infants straight to <LOCATION> Sleepytown </LOCATION>. `` A lot of adults say it works,'' says the 35-year-old musician from <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The album, `` Baby Road,'' is a takeoff of the <ORGANIZATION> Beatles </ORGANIZATION>' 1969 LP `` Abbey Road.'' It contains 12 songs, including 11 hits of the famed group and the title track written by Domino. The LP also parodies the `` Abbey Road'' cover, which showed the four <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> lads walking single file across a street. `` Baby Road'' shows four diapered tots strutting one behind the other across the road. `` These lullabies are dedicated to all children and their tired moms and dads,'' Domino writes on the album cover. Beatles' songs on the LP are `` Hey Jude,'' `` Yesterday,'' `` <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON>,'' `` Something,'' `` With a Little Help From My Friends,'' `` Norwegian Wood,'' `` For No One,'' `` In My Life,'' `` She's Leaving Home,'' `` Here, There and Everywhere'' and `` Good Night.'' `` I did n't try to compete with the Beatles, just be true to their music and not use a lot of hot licks,'' said <PERSON> Domino </PERSON>, who played with country star <PERSON> Waylon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> for four years. He got the idea for the album when his wife was pregnant. `` This is so much better than ` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Had </PERSON> a Little Lamb,''' he said. `` I tried to make them sound as simple as possible, but a lot of production was involved. `` I let the melodies come up by using the upper modes of the piano. The Beatles are very identifiable. You can play the melody and not be a slave to any original arrangement. `` I thought of their songs that could be acoustical and simple where you do n't tamper with the song and it brings it out. Some of the melodies worked and others would not.'' The only other musicians on the LP are <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, who played upright bass, and guitarist <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. The selections are strictly instrumentals without any lyrics. `` A lot of the songs are better without words, like ` She's Leaving Home. People think of their daughter leaving or about an unhappy teen-ager,'' <PERSON> Domino </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said he chose `` Yesterday'' for `` the purity of the medley. It's a song you have to include when you do a Beatles' lullaby record. The sound is very simple: The guitar carries the rhythm and the piano plays the melody well and draws attention to the song.'' He said `` Hey Jude'' has a strong emotional impact on people, especially parents. `` The theme is take a sad song and make it better. The song means so much to a person because they think of the words. The song triggers memories and emotions and it makes parents so happy to be sharing them with their kids.'' Domino, who's been playing piano since age 5, says he rates `` Michelle'' as the Beatles' hit with the best melody. `` I would play it a lot before I recorded this,'' he recalled. `` I always loved playing it.'' Some Beatles' songs did not fit well. `` Help!'' was too uptempo for a peaceful arrangement. Domino was wary of the stringed instruments used in `` The Long and Winding Road.'' `` Let It Be,'' he said, `` had an identifiable arrangement and I was reluctant to tackle it.'' He hopes to do a follow-up project, which like the first will be on his own Golliber Records in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. The next album will include some of the Beatles' songs he had to omit from the first. Domino, born and raised in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, had a featured part in the song `` One O'clock Jump'' which won a Grammy award in 1978 for the country group Asleep at the Wheel. After leaving the group, he played piano in the Broadway production `` The Best Little Whorehouse in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' He then joined <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' band, but quit two years ago in order to spend more time at home. The `` Baby Road'' project has been more rewarding for him than playing on the road. `` I get great letters from parents saying they are glad I did this record,'' he said. `` It's been a lot of fun and much more personal. I save every letter I get.'' His 2 -LCB- - year-old son, <PERSON> Will </PERSON>, who helped inspire the project, has a favorite song on the LP: `` Something. But it's a winner by default. `` He'd fall asleep so quickly he never listened all the way through,'' <PERSON> Domino </PERSON> said.

 The economy reversed a three-month slowdown in April as production and new orders picked up sharply, according to a survey of purchasing managers. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Managers </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday its index of economic activity rose to 54.9 percent last month from 53.3 percent in March. The index had declined the first three months of the year, indicating a slowing in economic growth. A reading above 50 percent generally indicates economic expansion, while a reading below that benchmark indicates the economy is declining, the group says. __ <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The government's economic indicators are pointing to continued growth. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its Index of Leading Indicators rose 0.8 percent in March after a revised 1.3 percent gain in February. In another report, the government said sales of new homes rose 4 percent in March, the second consecutive monthly advance. Earlier in the week, the government said the overall economy expanded at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, called the string of upbeat reports `` terrific news on the future state of the economy.''

 Back-to-back increases in new home sales have pushed such sales to the highest levels since August, the government says. The 4 percent rise in new homes sales in March followed a 14.1 percent jump the previous month, the departments of Housing and Urban Development, and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. But some analysts are worried that rising mortgage rates could limit growth in the second half of the year.

 The stock market hovered in a narrow range today, resuming its sluggish pattern of late last week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.66 to 2,033.99 in the first half hour of trading.

Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 26.35 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Evidence that the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace has lately been met with little enthusiasm by investors.

The move was also acceptable to <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION>'s negotiator, <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> said. Hood refused to comment on pay, insurance or other `` financial issues.'' Key issues, he said, concerned `` creating a joint management-labor safety program, trying to eliminate rotating shifts, extending time off for work-related injuries and basic civil rights in the plant.'' He declined to elaborate on the civil rights issue. `` The company has made it clear that the reason for these concessionary demands is for increased corporate profit,'' <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> said. `` It is difficult for the membership to understand in the face of past and projected profits that the company needs these additional concessions.''

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers have failed for the time being to agree on a token cut in oil production and oil markets reacted swiftly as prices fell today. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s oil minister said today he was pleased by the collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> talks, which were rescheduled for June 8. `` It's a very happy ending'' to a week of intense bargaining, the minister, <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, told reporters as he left the final session early this morning. His comment confirmed that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has adopted a hard-line stance against any production cuts that could give oil prices a boost. A chief beneficiary of higher prices would be <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which relies on oil to finance its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Last Tuesday, the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, accusing <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> of terrorism and subversion. The breakdown of negotiations caused oil prices to fall. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, West Texas Intermediate oil, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benchmark crude, was down 75 cents a barrel to $ 17.24 in early trading. In earlier <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trading, the price of Brent crude oil from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> was quoted at $ 16.20 a barrel, down 45 cents from the close in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Friday. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> spot, or non-contract, market was closed for the May Day holiday, and trading elsewhere in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was extremely light. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil minister, said he was not worried by the short-term reaction of traders in the free market. `` People who look at the price on Tuesday and beyond should take heart ... that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is trying to put its house in order,'' he said. Other ministers expressed disappointment at the breakdown of negotiations, which they viewed as a chance to shore up oil prices and open a new avenue to cooperation with non-OPEC producers who had proposed the production cuts. `` I would be much happier if we could have agreed on cuts now,'' said <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> oil minister <PERSON> Fawzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakshuki </PERSON>. The production cutting proposal was aimed at raising prices to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s target of $ 18 a barrel, from the current range of $ 14 to $ 16, by tightening supplies. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> led a minority of four cartel members opposing the proposed production cut of 300,000 barrels a day, or about 2 percent of the group's total output. The cuts were to be made in conjunction with the six non-OPEC producers, who offered to reduce their output by 5 percent, or about 200,000 barrels a day, if the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would do likewise. Failure by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to decide on a response to the offer was likely to draw criticism from the independent producers, who met with an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> committee in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> last Tuesday and Wednesday. <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, said the cartel leaders would resume their debate on possible cuts in production at their regular summer session in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on June 8. `` More time is required to clarify some of the points of the offer,'' <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> told a news conference this morning. He said that in the meantime <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members would `` do their utmost'' to abide by their assigned production quotas, which are scheduled to expire June 30. The quotas, agreed on last December, are designed to support an oil price of $ 18. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> prices have dropped several dollars below the target price this spring, however, prompting the cartel to seek collaboration with outside producers. The six countries involved in the talks with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> were <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has solicited the cooperation of independent producers since the start of this decade, when the development of a world oil glut began chipping away at <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to dictate prices. In 1986, oil prices collapsed, falling to less than $ 10 a barrel in July from nearly $ 30 the previous November. All <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries, including <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, have said they want to foster closer ties with independent oil producers. The Saudis, however, say they think the non-OPEC countries should bear a bigger share of the burden of reducing supplies. In the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> proposed a barrel-for-barrel reduction with the non-OPEC group, sources said. In supporting his stand against the proposed cuts, <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> told the closed-door meeting that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has cut its oil output in recent years from 9.9 million barrels a day to 4.3 million _ a far larger reduction than any other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member, according to a source who was in the meeting. The Saudis were supported by their main allies, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Award Attorneys' Fees to Tribes in Fishing Rights
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to award nearly $ 3 million in attorneys' fees to Indian tribes who won a lengthy court battle against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state officials over fishing rights. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck down the award on grounds a federal law reimbursing lawyers who represent the winning side in civil rights cases does not apply to the Indians' lawsuit. Twenty-one tribes sought to recapture legal fees awarded by a federal judge who then was overruled by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The Indians were supported by 33 other tribes who said their ability to vindicate treaty rights could be undermined if they are unable to recover legal fees won in court. The case acted on today stems from a 1970 lawsuit in which Indians asserted fishing rights in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state waters based on a treaty signed in 1885. Indians relinquished land under the treaty in return for guarantees of fishing rights. The treaty said the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> have the `` right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations ... in common with all citizens of the territory.'' Federal courts ultimately ruled the treaty entitled the tribes to approximately half the harvestable fish in state waters that passed through recognized tribal fishing areas. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld those rights in 1979. Years of litigation over legal fees followed, leading in 1985 to a federal judge's award of $ 2.95 million to the tribes to be paid by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. But the 9th Circuit court threw out the award last year. The appeals court said the fishing rights case was not covered by a 1976 federal law reimbursing the prevailing side's legal expenses in civil rights lawsuits. The appeals court said, in effect, that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state officials did not violate deliberately the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' rights by limiting their fishing harvest. The case was a dispute over the intepretation of the treaty, the appeals court said. `` It is not disputed that the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> had rights under the treaty,'' the appeals court said. `` Just exactly what those rights were was unknown until the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision -LRB- in 1979. -RRB- If the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> violates these now known and well-delineated rights, there would be an actual conflict between state and federal law which might give rise'' to a federal civil rights lawsuit. The appeals court added: `` That, however, has not yet happened and is not the situation here.'' Therefore, there is no basis for the award of legal fees, it said. Indians said the ruling could be devastating to their efforts at enforcing treaty rights. `` Cases to vindicate treaty rights affecting important resources of an area may take years to complete because of the extreme sensitivity of the issues,'' said a group of 33 tribes who supported the appeal by the <LOCATION> Washigton </LOCATION> tribes `` Such cases are especially draining on normally scarce tribal resources.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> Makah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribe </ORGANIZATION> vs. State of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 87-1390.

 The number of working oil and gas rigs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fell by 28 to total 880 this week, <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced. The rig count, the widely watched industry index of drilling activity, gained ground the week before, rising by four to total 908. A year ago, the count totaled 780, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> announced Monday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' rig count reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the number of working rigs since 1940. The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December 1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. Among major oil producing states, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> saw its rig count rise by four, while <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s rig count rose by three, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s rig counts each rose by one.

<HEAD>Their Comments Need No Comment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There are comments that need no further comment because they are so clear, incisive, sage or entertaining. There are others that claim your attention because they are so rare. Here are some of the latter: _ A chairman's letter to stockholders: `` Wow What a great year! Not only was the year 1987 the year in which your company celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversay as a company, but it did so in grand style. `` It was a banner year. It was celebrated, in part, by a 20 percent increase in revenues, and by a better than 300 percent increase in net earnings. `` This sterling performance was reflected in other ways as well. `` Our stockholders realized a 17 percent return on average stockholders' equity. The company's liquidity is excellent, with more than $ 10 million in cash and certificates as of Dec. 21, 1987.'' The only thing changed in this excerpt from the letter, written by <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazeter </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is the paragraphing _ for emphasis _ since good news becomes weighty in such large doses. It was n't all he offered. In spite of a stock repurchase program the amount of cash rose by $ 6.5 million. The company's long-term debt to stockholder equity was a negligible 0.14 to 1.0. The pension plan was overfunded. _ An economic forecaster's admission of error: <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Juster </PERSON>, an economics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, was among those who expected severe economic repercussions from the great stock market crash of Oct. 19 It has n't happened yet. On the evidence to date, says <PERSON> Juster </PERSON>, `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy has weathered the storm created by the financial panic last October, and is likely to resume a modest upward path after a sluggish first quarter.'' Among other things, he now observes, `` consumers appear to have concluded that the stock price decline was an event whose only impact was to wipe out a few speculators on Wall Street, but that it did n't mean anything to them.'' That result, he says, `` comes as a surprise to many analysts, including this writer.'' The admission stands out in bold relief, because many of his colleagues in the forecasting fraternity have never admitted a thing, and indeed continue to forecast with an assurance that suggests no miscalculation ever was made. _ A happy, bullish stock market forecaster: As a group, stock market forecasters seen unable to restrain their pessimism from deteriorating to despair Fair economic reports are interpreted as omens. Good news is suspect. Bad news is assembled to prove the case. They have been doing it with the numbers out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. If the economy shows strength it is viewed as a prelude to inflation and higher interest rates. If the numbers suggest weakness they portend a recession in the making. Seldom does an economist with one of the big institutions enunciate his views as boldly as does <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. He calls the latest economic reports `` beautiful numbers.'' `` So cheer up!'' he advises. `` Everything is going to be fine.'' While he expects to see government bond yields below 8 percent before the end of the year, he asks that bondholders learn to live with that because the economy will be doing well and inflation will be low. And, he concludes, `` We're still rooting for a 2,700 Dow by year-end.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has designed a plan it hopes will ease employees' jitters about a possible takeover. The `` work force stabilization plan,'' approved by the board of directors last week, would provide qualified employees with severance pay and other benefits should they be terminated without cause within two years of a takeover. Chairman <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> said the plan had been under consideration for some time and was not in response to any anticipated takeover attempt. `` <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> has been mentioned frequently as a takeover candidate, and the board has been concerned that such speculation is affecting our ability to retain and motivate employees, and therefore how well we're able to perform for our current shareholders,'' <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> fought off unfriendly takeover attempts in 1984 and 1985. Partly as a result of costs incurred in those battles, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> has reduced its workforce by nearly one-fourth. The protection plan includes enhanced severance pay of up to two years based on years of service, retirement benefits, home purchase provisions and extension of medical, dental and life insurance benefits. The plan covers eligible longtime <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> employees on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payrolls who are terminated without cause within two years of the trigger date, or employees who resign after a material loss of position, salary or benefits.

The officials declined to disclose details, however. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> meeting, the officials said, will devote its first day session to discussions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s high import tariffs and future plans to open its market for such <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> services and goods as advertising, beer and wine. The two sides will spend the second day discussing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s demand for retroactive protection of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intellectual property rights, the officials said The third will go for talks on eashing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s alleged restrictions on the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarettes, insurance and agricultural products, they said. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> meeting came after a series of bilateral talks on solving the issues had failed.

 Contracts for new construction dropped 3 percent in March, weakened by a sharp decline in commercial and industrial building, according to a survey released Monday. The survey, conducted by the F.W. Dodge Division of <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, showed that the value of new construction contracts on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis fell to $ 242.4 billion in March from $ 249.7 billion in February. `` With the usual winter volatility out of the way, March contracting data showed that 1988 construction activity is beginning to settle into a credible pattern as housing firmed and commercial building weakened,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> vice president and chief economist. `` We can look for some temporary improvement of housing starts in the months ahead as buyers become aware that mortgage rates wo n't be going any lower for a while.'' On the other hand, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said, commercial building faces the prospect of an extended decline as the surplus of office space is gradually absorbed. Contracting in March for commercial and industrial projects dropped 19 percent from a month earlier, although institutional building rose 14 percent, the survey showed. The value of newly started residential buildings declined 2 percent. Starts of single-family homes reached their highest rate so far this year, but declines in apartment and hotel-motel projects more than offset the modest improvement in single-family building, F.W. <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON> said. Contracts for nonbuilding construction _ mainly public works and utilities _ edged up 1 percent in March. Highway construction rebounded after several sluggish months, but March contracts for waste water treatment plants declined, leaving the total value of public works contracts virtually unchanged from February.

 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s scuttling of an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> plan for token cuts in oil production may signal a stiffened Saudi resolve to hold down world oil prices and punish archenemy <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Saudis appear increasingly intent on frustrating <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s efforts to galvanize a consensus for oil production cuts that could send prices higher this summer The result may be more in-fighting for the fractious Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and perhaps an even deeper political paralysis. Prices fell sharply Monday after <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> decided to suspend talks on a proposed 2 percent cutback in oil production until June. Most industry observers had expected the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> to go along with the cutback, since it was so small as to have virtually no effect on <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> evenues. An eight-country majority supported the cuts, which were to be taken in conjunction with cutbacks by a group of six independent oil-producing nations. The fact that Saudi Oil Minister <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> stood fast against the cuts appeared to mean the cartel's most influential member is unwilling to accept any <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> action that could lay the foundation for an Iranian-led price increase. Last December the Saudis successfully defeated an Iranian proposal to raise <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s official price by $ 2.70 a barrel, to $ 20.70. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> relies heavily on oil export revenues to finance its 7 -LCB- - year-old war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has helped bankroll the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> war effort. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlotok </PERSON>, who monitored the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected oil prices to slump this week and then hold steady until <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s June meeting. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members had hoped that by cutting back a little on production now, when world oil demand is relatively weak, prices would rebound and then jump even higher this summer during the traditional peak season for fuel consumption. By preventing an accord at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting, the Saudis probably ensured that any summer price increases will be small, limiting the benefit for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` This was, for the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION>, a clear political victory,'' said <PERSON> Bahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Karbassioun </PERSON>, a Vienna-based oil consultant and former member of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> staff. He said he believed the Saudis never had any intention during the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting of striking a compromise deal. `` It was a very well organized and well planned'' effort by the Saudis to deny <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> the agreement it badly wanted, he said. Last week, two days before the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting started, the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government announced it was breaking diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It accused <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> of engaging in terrorism and subversion. <ORGANIZATION> Kazempour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ardebili </ORGANIZATION>, the deputy Iranian oil minister, said after the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> announcement that it may have been intended to spoil the atmosphere of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting. <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaker of the Iranian Majlis, or parliament, on Sunday said the Saudi stalling on oil production cuts amounted to `` flagrant treachery'' orchestrated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have been rivals for power and influence within <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> from the early days of the cartel, which was formed in 1960 but did not gain a grip on pricing until the Arab oil embargo of 1973. In 1986, however, the Saudis and Iranians appeared to reach a tacit understanding to work together following a price crash that sent oil below $ 10 a barrel. The fragile alliance began to unravel last summer after rioting at the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, killed 402 people, most of them Iranian. As long as relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> remain poor, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is likely to encounter major problems holding oil prices steady, let alone raising them to the official target of $ 18 a barrel.

 The stock market meandered in a narrow range today, resuming its sluggish trend of late last week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.64 to 2,036.97 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. But losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 544 up, 940 down and 449 unchanged. Evidence that the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace has lately been met with little enthusiasm by investors. The government reported this morning that factory orders increased 1.6 percent in March. The market also has n't shown much response to generally strong corporate earnings reports for the first quarter. Analysts say individual investors and professional money managers continue to shy away from stocks, with memories still fresh of the crash last fall and controversy continuing over the effects of computer program trading.

<HEAD>LTV's Profit Up 12.7 Percent in First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported its profit rose 12.7 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, boosted by gains from the company's reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. The diversified steel and aerospace giant said Monday that its first-quarter profit increased to $ 163.9 million, or $ 1.16 a share, from $ 129.6 million, or $ 1 a share, in the first three months of 1987. The figure for the latest quarter includes a one-time special credit of $ 24.8 million resulting from the sale of two iron ore vessels. The rise in net income occurred despite a decline in first-quarter sales, to $ 1.88 billion from $ 1.91 billion a year earlier. `` The deferral of interest, pension and other costs while we are operating under the protection of Chapter 11 has greatly benefited both periods,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. The company entered Chapter 11 protection from creditors in July 1986. Hay noted, however, that the deferrals of costs and expenses have resulted in claims which must be provided for in a plan of reorganization before <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> can emerge from bankruptcy. In January 1987, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> terminated and took control of the three pension plans of subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, assuming financial responsibility for $ 2.3 billion in unfunded liabilities. But in September, the pension agency returned trusteeship of the plans to <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>, saying it took the step to curb abuse of the federal pension insurance program. It cited $ 252 million in profits the company reported for the first half of 1987 and <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s establishment of a new pension arrangement for its workers. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> has said it believes the agency's attempt to return trusteeship of the pension plans is illegal. Excluding the special credit for the sale of the vessels, the company said its operating income for the quarter rose to $ 151 million from $ 139.7 million a year earlier because of higher income from steel. Operating income from steel rose to $ 131.2 million from $ 101.1 million in the first quarter of 1987, while steel sales expanded to $ 1.3 billion from $ 1.2 billion. Income from <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s aircraft products division dropped to $ 11.3 million from $ 22.2 million, largely because of reduced activity following completion of the B-1B bomber program in the fourth quarter of 1987. Income from the energy products division rose to $ 2.6 million from $ 900,000 in the first three months of 1987.

 The oil ministers of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> said Monday they expected world oil prices to stabilize near current levels, despite the breakdown of an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting. But prices on world markets fell sharply after the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> conference ended with no agreement on a proposed 2 percent cut in the group's oil production. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Monday, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> oil </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benchmark crude, dropped 85 cents a barrel to settle at $ 17.14. Prices for refined products also slid. Asked by reporters if he thought prices would fall further in response to the stalemate, Saudi Oil Minister <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said, `` I do n't see why. I see -LRB- market -RRB- fundamentals improving.'' He was referring to projections that oil demand in the main industrialized countries will pick up this summer, relieving some of the downward pressure on prices. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> also said he was optimistic about gaining more cooperation from non-OPEC oil exporters, including American oil-producing states. `` The oil states in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are very, very much interested in the stabilization of the market,'' he said. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that regulates that state's oil industry, held talks with <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> officials last week in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> told them <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> wanted to `` open a dialogue'' with the oil cartel, despite <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s refusal to take such a step. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil minister, told separate news conferences that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was not worried by short-term reactions in the oil market. `` Our concern is not what happened ... on Monday or Tuesday but what happens to prices in the medium or long term,'' <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> said. At its current oil production rate of about 17.5 million barrels a day, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> stands to lose $ 122 million a week for each $ 1 drop in prices. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said his government was confident that prices will stabilize near <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s target of $ 18 a barrel in the longer term. `` We would n't pay any attention to short-term gyrations,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers had come to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> hoping to reach agreement with a group of six independent oil-producing nations on mutual export reductions. The non-OPEC group _ <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> _ offered to cut exports by 5 percent, or about 200,000 barrels a day, if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> did likewise. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> proposed that the cartel cut its output by 300,000 barrels a day, or about 2 percent, in order to establish a basis for a more formal relationship with the rival producers. But <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, backed by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, blocked the proposal, saying <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> should take more time to consider a response. <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, the Kuwaiti minister, told reporters <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> also should clear up some internal problems before deciding on new methods of cooperation with other producers. He said the lack of agreement within <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> on such technical issues as how to ensure compliance with oil production quotas made any new agreements on production cuts meaningless. `` We all realized that the extent of the problem is much greater than just cutting'' output now by a token amount, he said. He said an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> committee would study the technical issues before the next ministerial conference, set for June 8. Also, a separate <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> committee of five oil ministers is to hold bilateral and group meetings with the six non-OPEC countries prior to June, he said.

 Managers of <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- said Monday they have agreed to buy Ms. and Sassy magazines from the company's Australian parent for an undisclosed price. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, president and chief executive of the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Matilda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matilda </PERSON>'s vice president, said they expected to close the deal on May 20. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said no changes were planned at either monthly magazine. <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, acquired Ms. magazine last September. Unconfirmed reports had placed the purchase price at between $ 10 million and $ 15 million. Sassy, a new magazine aimed at teen-age girls, was launched in March. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> had previously estimated startup costs at $ 10 million. <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> was taken private in December, and <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said the company decided to sell the magazines to pay off some of its debts. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said she and Summers held an option to purchase the magazines, and they decided to exercise it after arranging financing from an unidentified venture capital group and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. `` This financial deal provides us with the best opportunity for the growth of Ms. and Sassy, while maintaining their independence,'' she said. She said the `` working capital we have been able to secure is equivalent to what <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> would have invested had their plans remained intact.'' Ms., which was founded 16 years ago by <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinem </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbine </PERSON>, has recently increased its rate base to 500,000 copies a month from 450,000. No circulation figures have been released for Sassy, but <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said the magazine has `` well and truly made its rate base of 250,000.'' She said other parties had inquired about the magazines, but she was unaware of any other firm bids for the two publications, which were put up for sale in the middle of March.

<HEAD>Japan's Surplus Falls 7.2 Percent In Fiscal Year 1987</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A surge in imports caused <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade surplus to fall 7.2 percent to $ 94.3 billion in the 1987 fiscal year, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. The report confirmed the continuing strength of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy in spite of the strong Japanese yen, which hurts the competitiveness of Japanese products in domestic and overseas markets. Exports grew 10.5 percent to $ 233.4 billion, but imports grew even faster, rising 26.9 percent to $ 139.1 billion. Both figures, measured on a balance-of-payments basis, were records. The report did not provide a breakdown of where <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s imports were coming from. But other recent figures have shown that the biggest growth is from the newly industrialized countries of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. Growth of imports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been sluggish. The trade surplus of $ 94.28 billion in the fiscal year ended March 31, although smaller than the 1986 surplus of $ 101.65 billion, was the second highest on record. The report demonstrated that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is still able to increase its exports at a double-digit pace in spite of the drag of the strong yen. At the same time, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s burgeoning consumer economy is sucking in more imports. Imports have also risen because Japanese exporters are getting more of their components from abroad. <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials noted that the composition of Japanese imports has shifted, with a larger share now consisting of manufactured goods rather than raw materials. Government programs aimed at reducing trade friction by limiting the economy's reliance on exports and encouraging domestic demand played a role in cutting the trade surplus. `` Although the higher value of the Japanese yen had an effect, the main cause of the fall in the trade surplus is the government's program to boost imports,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity `` These statistics show that the government's effort to change the country's industrial structure and reduce our dependence on exports has been successful,'' another ministry official said, also speaking anonymously. The country's current account surplus also plunged almost $ 10 billion during the fiscal year for its first decline in six years, the ministry said. The current account includes capital transfers and trade in goods and services to measure a nation's commerce. The ministry said the current account surplus registered $ 84.54 billion in fiscal 1987, down from $ 94.14 billion the previous year. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade, measured on a balance-of-payments basis, does not include freight or insurance charges on either imports or exports. Another commonly used trade measure, the customs-clearance basis, includes freight and insurance charges on imports. That boosts the value of imports and makes the trade deficit smaller.

 Continuing uncertainty about the health of the economy supressed demand for office space in the nation's central business districts during the first quarter, according to a study released Monday. The national real estate firm <ORGANIZATION> Cushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wakefield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said office vacancy rates jumped to 15.1 percent during the quarter from 13.8 percent in the previous quarter in the nearly 50 markets it reviewed. `` The uncertainty plaguing the financial markets and the economy's performance over the past eight months are beginning to affect the country's major real estate markets,'' said <PERSON> Cushman </PERSON> <PERSON> President </PERSON> and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirante </PERSON> II. <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> had the most vacant downtown space with a vacancy rate of 34.7 percent during the first quarter, up from 33.4 percent, although other oil-dependent cities showed some improvement from the previous quarter. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, had the second-highest vacancy rate of 28.8 percent, followed by <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, 28.1 percent; <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, 26.9 percent; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, 26.8 percent; <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, 26.4 percent; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, 25.8 percent; <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, 25.5 percent and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, 25 percent.

<HEAD>Mexico Plans to Hold Peso Currency at Current Rate for Rest of
Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As part of its inflation-fighting program, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will hold the peso currency at its current value against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar until the end of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Petricioli </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Petricioli </PERSON> told local reporters late Sunday that economic conditions permit the government to continue a freeze on the exchange rate that has been in effect since March. His remarks were reported in Monday's newspapers. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> chief said that any change in the exchange rate would give a kick to the inflation rate. `` There are people interested in continuing inflation because this makes the rich richer and the poor poorer,'' he said. `` A new slide in the exchange rate,'' he said, `` would be inflationary and the great majority of the Mexicans want stability in order to raise the standard of living.'' He predicted that consumer prices would rise about 2 percent a month by the middle of this year, well under the record 15.5 percent in January. `` Starting from then, the effort will continue so that this administration ends with very small inflation, which will establish the bases for a firm and sustained development,'' <PERSON> Petricioli </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>'s six-year term expires at the end of November. He is virtually certain to be succeeded by <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, the presidential nominee of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s presidential aspirations would be given a sharp boost if the government were successful in sharply paring back the inflation rate. The presidential elections will be held July 6. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> quickly fashioned the Economic Solidarity Pact in December after consumer prices surged dramatically. In all of 1987, the inflation rate was a record 159.2 percent. As part of the Solidarity Pact, the government announced in March a freeze on the prices of goods and services it regulates and the peso-dollar exchange rate. It extended the freeze in April and May and announced the minimum wage for unskilled workers also would be held steady during those two months. The government announced that consumer prices rose 8.3 percent in February and 5.1 percent in March. The exchange rate was 2,241 to 2,273 pesos to the dollar on Monday in the controlled market, which is used in about 75 percent of all commercial transactions. The free rate, used in tourism and for transactions along the U.S.-Mexico border, was 2,260 to 2,280 pesos to the dollar. In mid-December, the government devalued the currency to 2,200 pesos to the dollar.

 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second-largest bank said Monday it was seeking to acquire a majority stake in <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but analysts said swaying shareholders away from <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s competing hostile bid remains an uphill battle <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, which had sought a 45 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, said it will seek to purchase 9.5 million Irving shares, or about 51 percent of the New York-based bank. The state-run Italian bank is offering $ 75 a share, the same price as under its previous plan that sought to purchase 8.5 million shares. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay intererst on the per-share purchase price from May 31 until the deal closes. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> also said it `` continues to contemplate'' paying <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> shareholders a special $ 10-a-share dividend on remaining shares if it is successful in acquiring the bank. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board approved the amended offer and recommended shareholders tender to it, but analysts were less enthusiastic. `` I do n't think most investors will bother studying it,'' said <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Adair </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think it will be treated as fairly insignificant.'' <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said the offer, which hinges on a complex restructuring, has a blended value of between $ 65.20 and $ 72.55 a share, a slight increase over its previous offer. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said his company would not increase its bid, adding that `` the stock market has chosen to ignore BCI's proposal.'' In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> rose 12 -LCB- cents to close at $ 61.62 -LCB- a share; <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> rose 12 -LCB- cents to close at $ 30.50 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which holds a 5 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, is offering $ 15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its stock for each of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s 18.5 million shares outstanding, or about $ 1.08 billion. The bank also is waging a proxy fight by running a slate of 16 candidates for election to <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board at a shareholders meeting scheduled for May 6. As of last Friday, about 10 million Irving shares had been tendered under <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s buyout offer of roughly $ 64 a share. Those shares, coupled with the 888,634 shares <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> already owns, give the bank a 59.2 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, the company said. The tender offer was extended Monday for a fourth time; it will expire at noon EDT Friday. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s central bank has indicated it has no objection to <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase of a controlling interest in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italy </ORGANIZATION>'s support did little to quell analysts' more serious concerns over domestic regulatory approval. Because the ownership structure of the Italian bank is part industrial and part government, analysts believe approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> could be hard to come by. A <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale-Irving </ORGANIZATION> combination `` would violate our domestic laws on bank holding companies,'' <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> said. Some observers suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION>'s willingness to pay interest on its payout to shareholders is an admission that the deal could run into regulatory snags. `` The interest gives some protection about a prolonged approval process while shareholders are waiting for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to make up its mind,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. `` To some extent it's kind of a recognition of the potential tie-up of share for a long time,'' he added. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> received conditional approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> boards in March, and began its tender offer shortly after. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION>'s stock purchase is part of a complex restructuring proposed by <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> that includes several cost-cutting measures and asset sales. To that end, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said it will sell its 39 percent equity interest in <LOCATION> Banca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> della </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Svizzera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Italiana </LOCATION> to the Swiss-based financial firm <ORGANIZATION> Unigestion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> for $ 390 million in cash. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> estimates a pre-tax gain of $ 136 million, or $ 5 per share, from the transaction. The bank also said it would sell its 50-story building at One Wall Street. Both transactions are expected to fund the special $ 10 dividend payout. Irving Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said in a statement that the bank's board `` greatly appreciates the willingness of BCI to improve its offer. If the deal were consumated, <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> would have the right to buy an additional 10 percent of Irving stock on the open market.

 Blue-chip issues staged a modest rally, but the rest of the stock market lagged in a sluggish session Monday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.94 to 2,043.27.

 American steel companies put 95.5 percent of their production capacity into use last week, the highest percentage in nearly nine years, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. But the trade group noted that actual output was far below that of nine years ago because production capacity has been slashed due to competition from foreign mills. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers now have a maximum capacity of about 112 million tons a year, compared with just over 155 million tons when they operated at 96.3 percent of capacity in the last week of 1979, the group said. According to the group's latest report, steel production rose to 2.046 million tons in the week ended April 30, an increase of 3.9 percent from the previous week's 1.970 million tons. The capacity percentage was up from 91.9 percent the previous week. Estimated figures for the year to date put production at 33.653 million net tons, an increase of 27.6 percent from the 26.372 million net tons in the previous year. The steel operations of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest steel producer, were shut down by a strike during the first month of 1987. Production so far this year used 90.7 percent of capacity, compared with 71.4 percent a year earlier. Net tonnage by district for the week ended April 30: <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, 276,000; <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, 204,000; <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, 127,000; <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, 170,000; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, 171,000; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 559,000; <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, 203,000; Southern, 232,000; and Western, 104,000.

 Americans increased their efficiency in producing goods and services at an annual rate of nearly 1 pecent last quarter, the government said Monday in one of three reports showing a robust <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. Non-farm businesses improved their productivity by an annual rate of 0.9 percent from January through March, reversing a 1 percent deterioration in their efficiency during the previous three months, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Excluding agriculture and government, those businesses responsible for three-fourths of the nation's economic activity raised their output of goods and services by 2.7 percent with only a 1.7 percent increase in hours worked. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufactured products increased 1.6 percent in March while construction spending rose by 1.5 percent, much of it on government building and highway projects. `` Everything is coming up roses,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based economic consultant. `` A little trouble on the inflation front and in the financial markets is not a strong price to pay for this kind of super performance on growth, jobs and spending. It's an incumbent politician's dream.'' Meanwhile, on Wall Street Monday, blue-chip issues staged a modest rally, but the rest of the stock market lagged in a sluggish session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.94 to 2,043.27 but declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 4 to 3 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar was mixed against major currencies. Bond prices fell. Oil futures prices turned sharply lower in a wave of selling prompted by the failure of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to set temporary production cuts. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, West Texas Intermediate oil, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benchmark crude, slid to $ 17.14 per barrel for June delivery, down 85 cents from Friday's close. The increase in factory orders to a seasonally adjusted $ 216.08 billion in March after no change in February and a decrease in January was seen as coming from both domestic and foreign markets. While an export boom has been occuring for several months, analysts had seen little in trade figures to indicate that the devaluation of the dollar had made imports expensive enought to curb Americans' appetitites for them. `` These orders show that domestic auto and clothing makers are starting to displace the tide of imports,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Econometrics </ORGANIZATION>, in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` There's still no booming demand in consumer spending.'' The rise in construction spending was led by a 5.4 percent surge in government projects, some of the result of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> overriding President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of an $ 88 billion highway bill last year. The productivity gains were a surprise to most economists in the wake of employment reports showing the creation of nearly 1 million new jobs the first three months of 1988. `` The economy is not quite as strong as the employment data suggest,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. `` In fact the productivity numbers look pretty good.'' They showed wages and benefits increased at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the first quarter, raising the labor costs associated with each service or product by 2.4 percent annually. But those unit labor costs had soared at an annual rate of 4.5 percent in the final quarter of 1987, triggering fears among several analysts that the nation was on the verge of wage-push inflation. `` Productivity is the cushion you can put in between wage increases and price increases; this is good news for inflation,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. After taking inflation into account _ as measured by relative changes in total output and prices _ the wage gains the first quarter of 1988 yielded not a penny more of purchasing power for workers. Still, it is the first time since the last quarter of 1986 that they have even kept pace with inflation. Manufacturing, which still accounts for about one-fourth of the country's gross national product, continued to lead the effort in restoring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitivness. Productivity by manufacturers increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent the first quarter with a 4.3 percent increase in output on only a 1.3 percent increase in the number of hours worked in the nation's factories. For the first time since early 1986, factory workers actually kept ahead of inflation, according to the data. Nominal wage gains averaging 3.9 percent annually the first quarter _ the biggest in more than two years _ increased the purchasing power of assembly line workers by one-half of 1 percent. Their purchasing power had dropped 2.2 percent in 1987, according to the data. The wage and benefit increases also raised the labor costs associated with each item coming off the factory floor an average 1 percent, compared with a nearly 2 percent decline in unit labor costs in 1987. `` With unemployment rates at low as they are, you are going to see some upward pressure on wages,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON> `` That's good news for wage earners, bad for wage payers and, accordingly, for inflation.'' Most economists doubt that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can maintain the first quarter's productivity gains the rest of the year, particularly if joblessness remains at or near its current level of 5.6 percent. `` Output is limited by capacity in some industries, which points to more hours and sharper increases in labor costs for the rest of the year,'' said <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>. `` That in turn will hurt profits and add to inflationary pressures. Companies often try to increase prices off of rising labor costs.''

<TEXT>
 Gold prices fell and the dollar turned mixed against major foreign currencies in sluggish trading Monday as traders reacted to falling oil prices. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold bullion was bid at $ 445 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 450 an ounce late Friday. The drop in oil prices cooled fears of inflation, and that helped cause the fall in the price of gold. But currency traders reacted with uncertainty to the news on oil. Foreign-exchange trading was quiet because of holidays abroad. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> markets were closed Monday for a bank holiday, and there was nothing for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market to lead into because the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market was to be closed Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. `` It was very, very quiet,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> A. White, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Lower oil prices often hurt the dollar's value, partly because most oil is bought with dollars. Also, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> benefits less from cheaper oil than the import-reliant economies of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Oil traders reacted to the news that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> ended a meeting with no agreement on a proposed 2 percent cut in the group's oil production. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, West Texas Intermediate oil, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benchmark crude, slid to $ 17.14 per barrel for June delivery, down 85 cents from Friday's close. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.51 yen to a closing 125.33 yen from 124.82 yen on Thursday. Later, in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 125.20 yen. At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar stood at 1124.83 yen, down from 125.14 yen late Friday. Also in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the dollar gained more than a cent against the British pound. The British pound was quoted at $ 1.8645, compared with $ 1.8785 Friday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fell against the dollar to $ 1.8723 from $ 1.8755 late Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.6783 West German marks, up from 1.6773; 1.3974 Swiss francs, down from 1.3978; 1.2326 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2290; 5.7000 French francs, up from 5.6965; and 1,248.83 Italian lire, up from 1,248.00 Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's rates: 1.6810 West German marks, up from 1.6725; 1.4015 Swiss francs, up from 1.3910; 5.7153 French francs, up from 5.6805; 1.8860 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8745; 1,251.60 Italian lire, up from 1,242.00; and 1.2315 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2280. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 2.06 a troy ounce to close at a bid $ 450.30 an ounce. Gold in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> was also lower, closing at a bid $ 446 a troy ounce compared with $ 449 an ounce on Friday. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery was bid at $ 445.60 a troy ounce, down from $ 451 an ounce late Friday Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 6.37 a troy ounce, down from Friday's late <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> bid price of $ 6.45 an ounce.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Futures Plunge Along With Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Precious metals futures prices plunged along with those for crude oil and refined oil products Monday following the failure of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers to agree on production cuts. On other markets, grain and soybean futures were mixed; cattle and livestock were mostly higher and stock-index futures advanced. The discord within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was seen as negative for the inflation-sensitive precious metals because it suggests a continuation of low oil prices _ and low inflation. Analysts also cited the steady dollar and a lack of buying from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where banks and government offices were closed for May Day, as reasons for the sharp drop in gold and silver futures. `` But it was primarily the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> news and the effect that might have on inflation or the lack thereof,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, chief precious metals trader for <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said other economic signals that affect metals prices have been confusing and individual investors have been notably absent from the metals markets, leaving the markets prone to weakness. `` The signals are so mixed that no one is taking a firm view one way or another,'' he said. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold settled $ 5.40 to $ 5.50 lower with the contract for delivery in June at $ 447.20 a troy ounce; silver was 14.5 cents to 15.4 cents lower with May at $ 6.353 a troy ounce. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> took a hard line against <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production cuts at the cartel's meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, which ended Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers will meet again June 8 and may resume talks on tightening supplies to raise prices to the cartel's target of $ 18. But if the Saudis remain staunchly opposed to production cuts, `` it could conceivably mean we'll see a futher move on the downside,'' said <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, energy futures analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. In trading Monday, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> crude oil settled 60 cents to 85 cents lower with June at $ 17.14 a barrel; heating oil was 1.89 cents to 2.42 cents lower with June at 45.95 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.50 cents to 2.24 cents lower with June at 49.37 cents a gallon. Wheat futures fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> while corn finished higher and soybeans were nearly unchanged. Analysts tied the lower wheat prices to weekend rains and the higher corn prices to a lack thereof. Corn also was supported by a favorable export outlook, they said. Soybeans for May delivery traded as high as $ 6.98 a bushel during the session but prices retreated on late profit-taking, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agricultre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that 80 percent of the winter wheatcrop was in fair condition as of Sunday, with 15 percent rated good and 5 percent excellent. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also reported 78 percent of the spring wheat crop was planted as of Sunday, compared to 61 percent a year ago and well ahead of the average of 42 percent for that date; and 36 percent of the corn crop planted, behind the year-ago figure of 43 percent but ahead of the average of 24 percent. Wheat settled 2 -LCB- cents to 7 cents lower with May at $ 3 a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents to 3 cents higher with May at $ 2.05 \ a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 cent lower with May at $ 1.58 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 -RCB- cents lower to 1 cent higher with May unchanged at $ 6.89 -LCB- a bushel Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures finished mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .50 cent higher with June at 70.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .35 cent higher with May at 78.70 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .43 cent higher with June at 49.17 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .15 cent to 1.28 cent higher with May at 51.95 cents a pound. Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .70 point higer at 261.70.

<TEXT>
 An index measuring the ability of the typical American family to buy a home rose in March to the highest level this year as growth in incomes and lower mortgage rates offset higher home prices, a real estate trade group said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said its affordability index climbed to 114.2 in March, up from a revised February level of 113.7. The March number means that a family earning the median income of $ 31,526 annually had 14.2 percent more income than needed to qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of a median-priced home. The affordability index, which has been above 100 since June 1986, should remain in the positive range for the rest of the year although they predicted it would probably be pushed slightly lower in the months ahead because of rising mortgage rates. `` We have seen the best news in interest rates in 1988. Our forecast is for interest rates to drift upward for the rest of the year,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, the association's chief economist. The change in the index last month reflected a rise in the median price of a home, which climbed to $ 88,700. This was offset by a 0.5 percent increase in incomes and a drop in a composite mortgage rate to 9.08 percent, down from 9.16 percent the previous month. The composite rate reflects changes in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages.

 Twenty-four small utilities and cities in six Western states reached a $ 25.8 million settlement Monday with bondholders who sued them following <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>'s default on bonds sold to construct two nuclear power plants. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, lead counsel for the group, confirmed the agreement, the latest in a series of settlements totaling about $ 203 million involving defendant utilities, bond underwriters and legal firms. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said the 24 utilities, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, owned a combined interest of 6.5 percent in the two terminated plants, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> No. 4 on the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation and No. 5 at Satsop, west of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said most of the $ 25.8 million would come from insurance coverage, although some of the utilities would have to pay out of their own pockets. While maintaining they did no wrong, by settling the utilities saved legal expenses from a case that could take years to resolve and avoided the possibility of losing their case in a jury trial, he said. The giant case stemming from the <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> bond default, the biggest in municipal bond market history, is to go to trial Sept. 7 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> before Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. Dozens of individual cases were combined in the federal action. Eighty-eight utilities agreed to build the two WPPSS plants during the 1970s, but the plants were abandoned in 1982 after cost overruns and an assessment that the power from the plants would not be needed. The settlement Monday came on the eve of three days of hearings in federal court in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> before Judge <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> in the WPPSS case.
