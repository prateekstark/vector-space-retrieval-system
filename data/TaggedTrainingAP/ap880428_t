<HEAD>Chinese Cities Offer Direct Subsidies to Offset Inflation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chinese cities will begin offering direct subsidies to urban residents to help them cope with the soaring prices of pork and other food, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, where vegetable prices almost doubled in the first three months of this year, residents will each receive a monthly subsidy of 10 yuan -LRB- about $ 2.70 -RRB- as of May 1, the report said. People living in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> will receive a similar subsidy starting sometime in the next few months, it said. The direct stipends replace government subsidies to state food shops designed to keep food prices at an artificially low level. That system has proved ineffective in stopping price increases as consumers demand more and better food and farmers turn to free markets where their goods command better prices. The daily said that starting this month, <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has subsidized residents 10 yuan a month for four main non-staple goods _ pork, vegetables, sugar and eggs. Since then, the price for fresh pork at state stores has risen from about 40 cents to 56 cents a pound, and sugar has gone up from 18 cents to 27 cents a pound. Retail prices nationwide rose 11 percent in the first quarter, the first time the government has acknowledged double-digit inflation. Prices of non-staple food items increased by 24.4 percent and vegetables jumped by 48.7 percent in the same period.

 About 17,000 people, many waving <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> flags, braved a drizzling rain Friday to give birthday greetings to 87-year-old Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the world's oldest and longest-reigning monarch. Accompanied by Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> and other members of the imperial family, the emperor made the first of three scheduled appearances on a veranda overlooking a cheering crowd in the Imperial Palace grounds. Missing was Empress <PERSON> Nagako </PERSON>, 85, who suffers back and leg ailments. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, protected by bullet-proof glass, said in a brief speech, `` Thank you for celebrating my birthday with me today. I am happy that so many of you have come today. I hope you will all have a happy future.'' His birthday is a national holiday. It was the emperor's second appearance in public since he was hospitalized last September after complaining of fatigue and nausea. Doctors performed a bypass then around an intestinal obstruction. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, once worshiped as a living god, also spoke to well-wishers at the palace grounds on New Year's Day. Despite a slow recovery after the operation and rumors of ill health, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> appeared relatively strong Friday, although he shuffled slowly as he walked. Commentators on Japanese television said he seemed to have regained about 90 percent of the strength he had before the operation. The crowd shouted `` Long live the emperor!'' and waved flags. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> gave his characteristic front-and-back hand wave in response. After about 2 -LCB- minutes, the imperial family filed back into the palace, led by the emperor. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has been on the throne since Dec. 25, 1926. He told a news conference this week he feels well after his surgery and needs years more to finish research in marine biology, his favorite hobby. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> said he had replanted an endangered plant species on the palace grounds and `` it is growing well because the imperial garden is similar to forest land.'' The emperor also remarked that World War II was his `` most unpleasant memory'' and urged the Japanese to pursue peace. The remarks were carried in Japanese by the <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and translated by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The annual news conference, reduced from its usual 30 minutes to 15 because of concern about the emperor's health, took place Monday but the reports were not released until his birthday. `` I have recovered well ... I respect a doctor's advice and am trying not to overdo it,'' he said. ` Asked by the Japanese reporters about his memories of World War II, the emperor said: `` After all is considered, the war was my most unpleasant memory. I am pleased with people's efforts for peace after the war. Hereafter, I hope the people do not forget this matter and protect peace.'' He would not say say what caused <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to go to war, declaring: `` I do not want to answer the question because this will involve criticism against persons.'' In meetings with foreign reporters, the emperor has expressed sorrow for `` certain things'' that happened in the war, but said he acted as a constitutional monarch and had no personal role. He denied planning the attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, but left many other questions unanswered. Foreign reporters were not allowed at the birthday news conference, during which he answered eight questions. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Yoshihiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokugawa </PERSON>, his former grand chamberlain, who retired this month at age 81 after serving more than half a century. `` He protected recordings of the emperor's announcement of the defeat in the war,'' the emperor said. `` With his language abilities, he prepared well for my friendly visits to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Soldiers entered the imperial palace Aug. 15, 1945, planning to seize the recording so the war could continue. <PERSON> Tokugawa </PERSON> was beaten with a pistol, but refused to say where it was hidden. When the recording was finally played, it was the first time most Japanese had heard their emperor's voice. In it, he urged his people `` to open an era of grand peace for the generations to come, by suffering the insufferable, bearing the unbearable.'' He did not use the words `` surrender'' or `` defeat.''

 A car careened across a playground and plowed into a crowd of children and adults about to leave an elementary school Thursday, killing a 4-year-old girl and a woman and injuring eight others, officials said. At least four of the injured were in critical condition. `` I called for 10 ambulances,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, principal at <ORGANIZATION> Cyrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McCormick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` I told them there were bodies all over the playground.'' Witnesses said the car crashed through a chain-link fence and careened across the playground before running up a short flight of stairs to where the crowd was gathered in an entryway at the school. `` I was standing outside the school picking up my son when I turned my head and saw the car coming towards the door,'' said <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, 30, whose children, ages 8 and 5, attend the school. `` I just screamed and picked up my son with my hands and ran away. The car missed us by a yard and a half.'' `` There were mothers screaming, looking for their children,'' said <PERSON> Araceli </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, whose niece lives with her and attends the school. `` Almost every child that was on the floor had their mother next to them.'' The principal said the car pinned a child and an adult beneath it. `` Myself and a couple of the teachers and a janitor picked the car up and freed the bodies so they would n't be further crushed,'' he said. A woman driver reportedly left the car and walked from the scene, the car still wedged in the entryway. Patrolman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielman </PERSON> said police were questioning a woman who was picked up in the neighborhood minutes after the accident. No cause was given for the accident. <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, a student at <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, said the car belonged to his family and that his mother apparently had come to the school to pick him up. `` I got on my bus. I just saw my car, I do n't know where my mother is,'' he said. A 4-year-old girl and a woman died at <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> hospitals, spokeswomen said. In critical condition in <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> were a 7-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl, both with head injuries, and two children, ages 6 and 9, with leg fractures. A 7-year-old boy with head injuries was in fair condition. A 29-year-old parent was hit by the car and thrown into air but escaped serious injury, said <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Two children, ages 6 and 5, were taken to the hospital; one had head and neck injuries and was expected to be released, and the other had bumps and bruises and was in good condition, Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` The car smashed into the entrance where the kids were coming out,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cepak </PERSON>, 78, who lives nearby. Third-grade teacher <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said he saw a youngster trying to calm one of the injured women. `` A child was stroking her hair and telling her everything would be all right,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said.

 Separatist guerrillas who kidnapped 23 lawmen freed an anti-terrorism expert on Thursday and ordered him to negotiate on behalf of the terrorists, authorities said. Capt. <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Legorjus </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> anti-terrorism force in this French-held territory, was released from a cave on the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> and told to pursue negotiations with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> authorities, official sources in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> said. They threatened to kill their remaining hostages if he did not return to the rebel hideaway, a system of caves 110 miles north of here. Legorus, five police officers and an assistant prosecutor were seized by the Melanesian separatists Wednesday as they sought to negotiate the release of 15 other lawmen who had been kidnapped on April 22. The initial hostages were among 27 people kidnapped in a bloody attack at a police station that left four gendarmes dead. Twelve of those hostages subsequently were freed. The attack was part of widespread violence aimed at halting Sunday's French presidential elections on the island. Police said all the remaining hostages are being held in the <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> caves. The Melanesian separatists, known as Kanaks, released Legorjus to negotiate with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> authorities in <LOCATION> Fayaoue </LOCATION>, a village on <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Legorjus </PERSON> made at least one trip by helicopter from the cave on Thursday. `` When you open talks, you take risks,'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Giraud </PERSON>, responsible for order in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> archipelego </LOCATION>, said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, minister for overseas territories, said in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> that he has asked the government to outlaw the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is seeking <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> `` It appears now that there is collusion between terrorist acts carried out in certain parts of the territory, including the taking of hostages on <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, and the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> political group -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said. Membership in a banned group is a crime under French law. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, Conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> referred to the Kanak front as a `` terrorist faction'' that does not represent the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonian </LOCATION> population. `` I will do everything so that this group is reduced,'' he said during a televised debate with Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, his rival in presidential run-off elections May 8. `` What counts today is the liberation of the gendarmes and judicial offical,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said. `` But what counts tomorrow is dialogue.'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> did not clearly say whether he supported outlawing the front. Such a ban must be voted by the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, which meets again Wednesday. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> would have to sign the decree to make it law. <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON>, the No. 2 leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> political group, said banning the organization `` would not settle the crisis in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> and will not stop the <LOCATION> Kanak </LOCATION> people from taking the fight for independence to its end.'' Since Friday last week, election-related violence has left six people dead on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> and at least 10 wounded. Native Melanesians make up 43 percent of the population of 145,000, while 36 percent are Europeans and the rest primarily Asian or Tahitian. Many Kanaks desire independence, while most Europeans wish to retain ties to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. An estimated 4,000 French troops and gendarmes are in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> police officer was shot Thursday near <LOCATION> Canala </LOCATION> on the east coast of the mainland, according to the national police headquarters in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. He was listed in good condition at a <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> hospital. The kidnappers have demanded the removal of police reinforcements from the islands. They asked that mediators be sent from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to discuss a new referendum on self-determination.

 In a swirl of old lace and memories, about 100 former residents and 300 relatives gathered Wednesday to mark the night a half-century ago when four western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> towns were submerged to provide drinking water for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, the High Sheriff of <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, dressed in top hat and tails and holding the 7-foot mace of his office, called the dance to order and read a proclamation from Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declaring 1988 a Year of Remembrance. `` We had to limit ticket sales to 400. That's all the hall would hold,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, secretary of a consortium of local historical societies that sponsored the Remembrance Ball at the University of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The dance tickets reprinted the black-bordered tickets to the firemen's ball in 1938 at the <LOCATION> Enfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, where residents met to mark the last hours of the towns that were drowned to create the 38-square-mile Quabbin Reservoir. Their steps might be slower and their hair turned silver, but for former residents _ many in their 70s and 80s _ the memory was still fresh of that night when people jammed the little brick Town Hall, hung with red, white and blue bunting and draped in black, and spilled into the streets. `` The orchestra ... faintly sounded the strain of ` <ORGANIZATION> Auld </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syne </ORGANIZATION>' ... muffled sounds of sobbing were heard, hardened men were not ashamed to take out their handkerchiefs,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Springfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> reported in 1938. Fifty years later, 38 people who attended the <LOCATION> Enfield </LOCATION> party held hands and marched around the hall. Their reminiscences, jotted down on their dance programs, were read aloud between dance tunes. `` We went to school at the <ORGANIZATION> Enfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>. We lived in the center of town. That's the deepest part of the reservoir now,'' said <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Boch </PERSON>. The towns of <PERSON> Dana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Enfield </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> _ home for 2,500 people _ were submerged at midnight April 27, 1938 The reservoir took 20 years to build and cost $ 53 million and the lives of more than 20 workers. It now provides drinking water for 2.5 million people, half of the state's population. Although it's not the largest reservoir in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, none larger has been built strictly to provide drinking water.

 A judge Wednesday ordered the government to pay $ 4.2 million to a truck driver left brain-damaged and paralyzed in 1984 when he was hit by a piece of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> equipment being loaded onto his flatbed trailer. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Takasugi </PERSON> ruled that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> employees were negligent in the accident involving <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitzke </PERSON>, 57, of suburban <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Somnang </PERSON> <PERSON> Rom </PERSON>, a 10-year-old Cambodian refugee, bounded off the airplane and into the arms of the elder brother who'd last seen him as an infant. The boy is part of a family that was reunited Tuesday night after a decade apart. They had been separated by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> takeover in that Southeast Asian nation. <PERSON> Somnang </PERSON> and his mother, <PERSON> Prak </PERSON> <PERSON> Soy </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday night for an emotional reunion with <PERSON> Sarin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rom </PERSON>, who came to this country in 1983 and has been trying to reunite with his mother and brother since learning they were alive. After the communist takeover of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the father was taken away by soldiers and is presumed dead. Two siblings starved to death. A brother is missing. A sister is married and lives in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The younger <PERSON> Rom </PERSON> and his mother spent Wednesday adjusting to a new life in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. `` I heard a ball bouncing this morning at 5:30,'' <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON>, who lives below the family, said Wednesday. `` He learned how to use the camera and has been taking pictures all morning.'' <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON> said they turned lights off and on as they experimented with electricity and watched television for the first time. `` They could n't understand,'' <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON> said, describing their fascination with the tube. `` Somnang was jumping up and down.'' The red tape that delayed the reunion frustrated Sarin and the people of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> who helped him, including foster parents, friends, local churches and community groups. Many came to the airport Tuesday to greet the family. `` There were so many delays,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, the Vermont Refugee Coordinator. `` We had to wait for so many governments to find a way.'' <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sarin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rom </PERSON>'s foster mother, said the reunion is not quite complete.

She was reportedly abducted while in a refugee camp. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said his office became involved because the entire community was backing <PERSON> Rom </PERSON> in his efforts to find his family `` We've been working with them for 17 months,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. `` There were times when we did n't know whether we'd get anwyhere.''

<TEXT>
 Four Hollywood unions spent $ 6.8 million on treatment for 138 AIDS patients by early this year, but a representative of producers and studios says the problem is no worse than in other industries. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Counter </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday he was sure that the figures from union health insurance funds were `` understated'' because some AIDS insurance claims may be reported as related diseases rather than AIDS. Counter's remarks represent the first time anyone has attempted to compile statistics on the number of AIDS patients whose care is being paid by health insurance funds serving the entertainment industry's five major unions. But he dismissed fears that AIDS can be spread by casual contact, including on movie and television filming sets, and said he was convinced the deadly disease, which cripples the body's immune system, can not be spread by so-called `` deep kissing'' by actors and actresses `` I do n't see that this problem is any worse or any less in our industry than in all industries,'' <PERSON> Counter </PERSON> said at a conference titled `` Managing AIDS at Work.'' He urged entertainment unions and companies to `` wage war on this disease on four fronts'' _ education, prevention, research and care. The insurer providing coverage for one of the industry's five funds _ the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AFTRA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Health and Retirement Funds _ refused to provide statistics on the number of its 22,000 members who have AIDS or the cost of their care, said alliance government affairs specialist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, who compiled the statistics for Counter. The 138 patients reported by mid-February and the $ 6,821,000 cost of caring for them represent statistics reported by insurance funds for the other four major <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> union health funds, <PERSON> Counter </PERSON> said. Scientists say acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread by intimate sexual contact, the sharing of needles by intravenous drug abusers and when passed from mothers to their unborn children.

<BYLINE>New Class of Superconducting Material Enters High-Temperature Race

<TEXT>
 A new, high-temperature record for superconductivity in materials that lack copper has raised hopes that such substances may one day make superconductivity practical, scientists reported today. A mix of potassium, barium, bismuth and oxygen showed evidence of superconductivity at about minus 406 degrees Fahrenheit, researchers from <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> reported in the British journal Nature. That temperature essentially equals the 1986 mark that focused world attention on superconductivity. But it is well behind the current record for materials that contain copper, the chief focus of superconductivity research. Superconductivity is the ability of some materials to conduct electricity without resistance. Improved superconductors could lead to powerful computers, high-speed `` floating'' trains and other advances, scientists say. So far, all known materials must be `` supercooled'' to superconduct, and that limits their use. So scientists are trying to find superconductors that work at higher temperatures, even room temperature. Since the 1986 report of superconductivity at about minus 406 degrees, researchers have used copper compounds to superconduct at minus 243 degrees. The performance by a copper-free compound indicates `` a whole new ballfield'' for study, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleury </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. Still higher temperatures for copper-free compounds may yet be attained, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Laudise </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labs </ORGANIZATION>. The work shows copper can be replaced, and by a broader list of potential ingredients than many theories would have predicted, <PERSON> Laudise </PERSON> said. `` With so many possibilities, the chances of getting something that will have all the desirable properties in one material will be enlarged,'' he said. Those properties include ease of fabrication into wires and other devices and the ability to retain superconductivity while exposed to high currents or high magnetic fields, he said. The material's atomic structure suggests it may have one practical advantage over other known superconductors, <PERSON> Laudise </PERSON> said. Copper-based superconductors work best when the electrical current runs parallel to their stacked layers of copper and oxygen atoms. But the new material has no such layers. Instead, bismuth and oxygen atoms form interconnected sheets that extend along all three dimensions. That suggests that it may carry current equally well in all three dimensions, which could simplify making superconducting wires and other products, <PERSON> Laudise </PERSON> said. Studies of the earlier compounds had concluded that the copper-oxygen layers were essential for their superconductivity. The new material shows those layers are not always needed, although the temperature in copper-free compounds may go higher if researchers can create bismuth-oxygen layers, said <PERSON> Fleury </PERSON>. The finding `` is likely to give us a much better insight into the nature of high-temperature superconductivity'' than would emerge from studying just the materials with copper, he said. The Bell researchers were led by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cava </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bertram </PERSON> <PERSON> Batlogg </PERSON>. Other superconductivity experts said the report's importance will depend on whether copper-free materials can perform as well as previous superconductors. The more ingredients that can be used, the better the chance of finding a room-temperature superconductor, said physics professor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a first step, and a good one,'' he said. `` Once again, it just tells me we've just seen the tip of the iceberg'' for superconducting materials, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Maple </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>USDA Says It Will Rewrite Sugar Cane Rules Under Court Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to act quickly on a federal judge's order to rewrite its rules excluding sugar cane as a perishable commodity. Rewriting the rules could open the way for thousands of foreign field workers to become legal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents, an avenue barred to them if <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s original definition of sugar cane as a non-perishable crop were allowed to stand. Department officials said Wednesday the court's decision was under review and modified regulations could be expedited, although they declined to give a timetable. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, in a ruling released Tuesday, said the department `` arbitrarily and capriciously excluded'' sugar cane from the perishables list and to `` conduct further proceedings'' to determine the crop's status. The decision resulted from a lawsuit filed on behalf of sugar cane workers. Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> a year ago defined fruits, vegetables and other perishable commodities which are produced as a result of seasonal field work. The law's Special Agricultural Worker, or SAW, program allowed temporary legal resident status for foreign workers who formerly helped in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of designated perishable crops. The law also provided avenues for alien workers to become <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. By the department's definition, those crops not only included fruit and vegetables, but also wheat, sugar beets and a number of other commodities. Sugar cane was excluded from the list of perishables. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, the department's chief labor specialist in the development of the regulations, had relied on a telephone call to a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economist to determine the category of sugar cane as a crop `` despite the extensive written record'' on the matter. `` Based on this conversation and his own personal knowledge regarding the harvesting and labor practices in the sugar cane industry, Mr. French concluded that sugar cane was outside the scope of perishable commodities,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said. The agency, he added, rejected the impact of weather condition on crops because of the difficulty in measuring the impact or `` the overinclusive nature of such a criterion.'' French has been a special assistant for labor in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> since Jan. 12, 1987, and had held previous posts in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, and as a labor relations consultant with <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Although he declined to predict just when <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> would make the changes to comply with the court decision, French said, `` We're not going to drag our feet on this.'' The sugar cane revision could be handled internally by the department or could involve a public hearing, he said.

Varroa mites were discovered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last September in a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> apiary. Since then, they have been found in 12 other states: <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The original federal quarantine was effective on April 6 and restricted the interstate movement of bees and bee equipment from all 13 states. <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said the change in the original quarantine was partly because both <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are enforcing restrictions on the movement of bees and bee equipment within their own borders. The mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their developing larvae, or brood. It causes decreased brood, deformed bees and a weakening of the colony's ability to pollinate plants and produce honey. Infestation can occur so gradually that the mites may not be noticed until severe damage is done.

Federal and state authorities are tracing the disease to determine if additional birds or premises may have been exposed. Exotic Newcastle disease can cause death rates of 50 percent to 95 percent in poultry flocks. Officials say the disease poses no risk to humans who eat poultry or eggs, but in some cases people who handle infected birds can contract the virus, which in humans causes temporary eye inflammation and `` mild flu-like symptoms.''

 <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> could barely carry on a conversation in the two weeks before he died and was gravely ill the day he signed his revised will, a nurse who cared for the glitzy entertainer testified Wednesday. The pianist could n't even find his way back to bed from the bathroom on the day of the signing, nurse <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Garber </PERSON> said at a hearing on a request by associates of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s to remove <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> as executor of his estate. The testimony contradicted that of <LOCATION> Strote </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s attorney, who said that <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> sat at a table Jan. 22, 1987 talking with him and going over the estate papers before signing them. The papers named Strote executor. `` He'd say yes to anything to please -LRB- at that point -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>. `` He just wanted to please anyone and be left alone.'' <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> said she cared for <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> from the day he signed the will until he died of AIDS 13 days later, on Feb. 5, 1987. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> could not put on his glasses or hold a book during his dying days at his <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> home, she said. `` He could n't have a conversation, he was too sick. The motor coordination was going so he'd have difficulty speaking,'' she said. `` He was so childlike he did n't know what he was saying.'' The five seeking to have <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> removed _ <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s sister, his former manager, two housekeepers and a longtime friend _ were given a total of $ 1 million in the will, the terms of which were made public Wednesday. Testimony indicated three of the five received more in the deathbed will Strote drew up than in a will <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> executed in 1982. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> also left $ 50,000 in trust to take care of his seven dogs, which he often referred to as his `` babies.'' Strote has estimated the value of the estate at $ 11 million. His manager of 37 years, <PERSON> Seymoour </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, has estimated the figure at $ 20 million. Strote on Tuesday defended the signing of the new will and two trusts. He said he had <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> examined by a doctor first, and the doctor was convinced <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was `` in good condition and could understand'' the documents. `` I wanted to make sure he was physically able to go through the documents and understand them,'' <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> signed the will and two trusts, but balked at a fourth document, a living will that would allow doctors to remove life support systems if they became necessary. `` He said ` I just ca n't sign this,''' <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> recalled. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said he felt he had to move quickly in tying down the entertainer's assets and cutting expenditures, which he said were running $ 100,000 to $ 200,000 a month, more than the estate was generating. `` I wanted to liquidate the property while his image and likeness were fresh in the minds of the buying public,'' Strote testified. An auction of Liberace memorabilia in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> earlier this month netted some $ 2 million.

<HEAD>Report Warns Against Dwindling Supply Of Housing For Poor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Privately owned housing for the poor could almost disappear within 15 years as owners default on mortgage payments or convert property to high-rent apartments and condominiums, a bipartisan commission says. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Low-Income </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in a report to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> housing subcommittees that the cheapest way to ensure the poor have housing is to preserve and even fix up the current housing stock. It suggested that the federal government earmark $ 11.3 billion over the next 15 years to keep owners from converting the housing and to help owners who are having trouble making mortgage payments. An additional $ 6.4 billion should go toward continuing federal subsidies, the commission said. It also recommended an office should be set up within the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> to deal only with the issue. `` Everyone talks about the homeless as the tip of the iceberg,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Parke </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, executive director of the commission. `` We have described the iceberg. We are going to have a new generation of the homeless.'' <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said 70 percent of the people living in the subsidized housing have incomes below 50 percent of the median for their area. `` These are very poor people,'' she said. If the stock of privately owned subsidized housing should dry up, the poor may have no other housing options, she said Much of this country's low-income housing was built in the 1960s and early 1970s. Some of it is federally owned, some state-owned. The commission, in the report called `` Preventing the Disappearance of Low-Income Housing,'' discusses only privately owned properties subsidized by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> with mortgages insured by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. That amounts to about 645,000 units. The commission argues that without federal action, owners of 43 percent _ or 280,000 units _ will default and an additional 38 percent _ 243,000 units _ will prepay their mortgages in the next 15 years. <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, along with an <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the federal government in the past has had to deal with scattered cases of defaults. Both <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Denery </PERSON> said that there also have been numerous instances of prepayments of mortgages by owners who want to free their properties from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> restrictions and rent or sell to higher-income people. <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said the prepayment problem has been especially prevalent in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. But the commission concludes that both the prepayments and defaults will accelerate in the next decade as federal rent subsidy contracts expire. Also accelerating the trend is the new federal income tax law, which removed many of the tax incentives for investing in such housing. `` Everyone dealing with the project was surprised at the projected level of default,'' <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. `` Add that together with the prepayments and we see the number of units of low-income housing going steadily downward.'' <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, who is assistant secretary for housing and federal housing commissioner, said he supports the commission's basic premise _ that it is better to preserve existing housing for the poor rather than build new housing. He also complimented the commission for trying to look at lower-cost solutions to the problem, although he suggested that there may be even less expensive ways. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said he opposes the commission's recommendation that a separate office to set up inside <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to deal with preserving the privately owned low-income housing. `` I've had people specializing in this for a year and a half,'' he said. `` The issue also has the focus and attention of an assistant secretary.''

In recent speeches, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has invoked the memory of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> to make serious or humorous points, or both. All presidents refer to their predecessors from time to time, either favorably or not. By custom, each president gets to pick the pictures of former presidents that hang in the Cabinet Room. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, for instance, replaced <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> with <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON>. Now the president, who leaves office next Jan. 20, is quoting the wit and wisdom of presidents past, recalling how they dealt with the press and with their cabinets. On March 22, addressing Republican local officials at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> related a story that he said <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> told when he found all but one of his Cabinet officers were against him on an issue. The story was about a man who fell asleep during a revival meeting just before the minister said, `` All of you who are on the side of the Lord, stand up.'' As the man slept on, the minister intoned, `` All of you who are on the side of the devil, stand up.'' At that point the sleeper awoke, stood up and said, `` I did n't exactly understand the question, parson, but I'll stand by you to the end It does seem we're in a hopeless minority.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went on to tell the Republicans that they might be in a minority among city officials who claim the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> has shorted them, but their views are `` the majority beliefs in this <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' On March 30, presiding at the swearing-in of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told one about <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. <PERSON> T.R. </PERSON>, he said, once told Saint <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>: `` Your choir is weak, inexcusably weak. You should reorganize it at once.'' Saint <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> says, `` All right,'' and gives T.R. the job. `` Well,'' said <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, `` I'll need 10,000 sopranos, 10,000 altos, and 10,000 tenors.'' `` But what about the basses?'' asked Saint <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>. `` Do n't worry about that,'' said T.R. `` I ` ll sing bass.'' Like Roosevelt, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s job now was to be `` a one-man bass section.'' On April 13, addressing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told stories about <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and their dealings with the press. `` Every morning before dawn, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> would hike down to the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, strip off his clothes, and swim,'' he said. `` And one summer day, a woman of the press, under orders from her editor, followed him. And after he'd plunged into the water, she popped from the bushes, sat on his clothes, and demanded an interview. And she told him that if he tried to wade ashore, she'd scream. So <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> hld the first press conference up to his neck in water. `` I know how he felt.'' Of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, he said that once when <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION> was coming off the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor while he was vice president, he grabbed a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and shouted, `` You! I've been looking for you.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> pulled the reporter into his office, started haranguing him and then, about halfway through, scribbled a note, buzzed his secretary, and gave it to her. The secretary returned with another note, which <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> glanced at and threw away. When the reporter finally got away, he saw <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s note lying on a desk. It said, `` Who is this guy I'm talking to anyway?

<HEAD>Bill To Permit Drilling On Refuge Clears Subcommittee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Advocates of petroleum development in the nation's biggest wildlife refuge are gaining ground in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but say they are fighting the clock to get their drilling bill enacted this year. Led by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the oil industry, the advocates won another round against environmental groups on Wednesday as legislation to allow oil rigs into the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> was endorsed by the first House panel to vote on the issue. The bill was approved 17-9 by the <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the environment, setting the stage for expected approval next week by the full committee. Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 11-8 for legislation to allow development of the potentially extensive oil deposits in the coastal plain of the 19 million-acre reserve in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The bill is awaiting floor debate. The issue has provoked a major struggle in the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> between environmentalists, who want no drilling in the refuge, and those who say the refuge offers the best chance to counter a growing national dependence on imported petroleum. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study says development can be carried out in an environmentally sound manner and could produce oil to rival the <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> complex about 70 miles to the west. <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> accounts for about 20 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, one of the major <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> champions of drilling in the refuge, said Wednesday that time is growing short. Young quoted House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, as saying that because of a crowded calendar and time off for political conventions and reelection campaigns, a drilling bill needs to get to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor by mid-June to ensure approval by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also has jurisdiction over the issue. Its chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., is sponsoring legislation to declare the refuge permanently off-limits to petroleum development The Interior water and power resources subcommittee is not planning to hold hearings on refuge legislation until early June. In the past, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been more sympathetic to environmentalist positions than many other House panels. The <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee approved a plan drafted by Rep. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, to allow phased oil leasing over a decade but bar development in a 260,000-acre are used for calving by a migratory caribou herd. Drilling in the refuge would be exempt from the Refuge Administration Act of 1966's requirement that development be compatible with a refuge's basic purpose of preserving wildlife habitat. That law requires developers to prove compatibility, a difficult task. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' bill, however, would force opponents of developing the coastal plain to prove that such activity would have significant and adverse long-term effects on habitat, also seen by subcommittee lawyers as a difficult task. The bill would prohibit export of any petroleum extracted from the 1.5 million acre coastal plain and would require any ocean transport of this oil to be done on ships registered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The legislation also would create a new 23.5 million-acre Teshekpuk-Utukok National Wildlife Refuge to the west of <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and place a five-year moratorium on any petroleum leasing in the new refuge. Drilling foes repeatedly failed in attempts to amend the bill. Rejected proposals included variations on the theme of putting off a decision on the coastal plain until completion of a national energy policy study emphasizing conservation and renewables.

<HEAD>Canadian Leader Gets Nothing From Reagan on Acid Rain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> seeking more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action to reduce the acid rain that he likens to `` dumping garbage'' on his country, but he got no promises from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. During a one-hour meeting on Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held to the administration's 7-year-old position that more research is needed before targets are set for reducing the pollution blamed for acid rain. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> had used the meeting and a subsequent speech to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to renew Canadian pleas that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> follow his country's lead by setting specific pollution-reduction targets and timetables. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s program will cut pollution levels there to half the 1980 levels by 1994, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` But that is only half the solution, because the other half of our acid rain comes across the border, directly from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, falling upon our forests, killing our lakes, soiling our cities,'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has rebuffed pleas from Northeastern states as well as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to set targets and timetables, calling instead for more scientific investigation to establish the most effective cleanup methods before spending money on acid rain reduction. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` some private ideas'' on how they might narrow their differences on the issue. The talks, however, did not alter the administration view that there is little possibility an acid rain accord sought by <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> will be reached before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office next January, the official said. Prior to his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> visit, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acid-rain emissions drifting into his country are tantamount to `` dumping garbage'' on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Using more elegant language in his speech to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he said, in effect, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is doing the same to its own environment. `` The one thing acid rain does not do is discriminate,'' he said. `` It is despoiling your environment as inexorably as ours. It is damaging your environment from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and threatens marine life on the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seabord </LOCATION>.'' He welcomed additional research into ways to reduce emissions from coal-fired furnaces, but said more action is needed. `` <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will continue to press fully its case to rid our common environment of this blight, and we shall perservere until our skies regain their purity and our rains recover the gentleness that gives life to our forests and streams. And we hope the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and people will respond exactly the same way,'' he said. `` The cost of reducing acid rain is substantial, but the cost of inaction is greater still,'' he added. While the leaders remained apart on the acid rain issue, they joined in an appeal to both nations' legislatures to ratify the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, designed to abolish tariffs and further enrich what is already the world's biggest trading partnership. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> noted that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sells more goods in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> than it does to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> combined. `` This is a good, balanced and fair agreement, the most important ever concluded between two trading partners,'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> also said they do not believe the pact will be endangered by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s threatened veto of a trade bill being considered in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the official reporting on their meeting said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also gave his permission for the Canadian purchase of tightly-held <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear submarine technology. The Canadians are considering the purchase of 10 or 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. If they choose the British `` Trafalgar'' class subs, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> permission will be required because the submarines use American power plants. An amendment to current U.S.-Canadian agreements would also be required and thorough <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> discussion of the issue is likely. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the president's decision to transfer classified technology must rest on national security interests, not political considerations.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will explore the issue `` extensively.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> set aside their differences over acid rain and accentuated the positive at a White House state dinner Wednesday evening. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lauded his Canadian counterpart as `` a good neighbor and a firm friend,'' and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> reciprocated by calling <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` honest and wise.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nicaraguan rebel leaders headed into talks today with their negotiating position weakened by a split between military and political chieftains, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other sources. The Contra chain of command remains intact only because an attempt by veteran rebel leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> to oust military commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> a week ago was unsuccessful, the sources said. The dispute between <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> has been simmering for years and came to a head following the temporary truce signed last month by the rebels and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said that at a meeting last week in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, the five <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> directors split 2-2 with one abstention on a proposal for <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>'s removal. Another source said he was not aware a formal vote had been taken. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> ostensibly takes orders from the five-member civilian directorate but believes he should have more influence over the decision-making process, according to the sources. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> has maintained that civilian control over the movement is essential and sees <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> as a threat to that objective. According to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, it would be a mistake to have ousted <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> because `` he is the glue which holds the movement together.'' With <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> gone, the official said, the Contras would splinter and cease to be a credible fighting force. The sources, all of whom insisted on anonymity, said the mistrust among the Contra leaders is expected to weaken their negotiating position at this week's talks in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> has expressed support publicly for the peace process, the sources said he believes the agreement signed a month ago put the rebel fighters at a severe disadvantage. The Sandinista government and the Contras agreed to a 60-day cease-fire and to try to negotiate a permanent settlement. Thus far, the two sides have agreed on the location of seven cease-fire zones to which the Contras would transfer once ground rules for activities in these areas were spelled out. But as today's talks were getting under way, this remained a key area of disagreement and the Contras have yet to resettle in the designated zones. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> has written to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that he believes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food shipments to Contra rebels based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> are illegal. <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> is a member of the commission assigned to verify compliance with the temporary truce. The dispute involves $ 47.9 million in humanitarian assistance approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> four weeks ago after the Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> signed their agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> was assigned the task of managing the aid program and has sent 125.6 metric tons of food by truck to Contra camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> starting last week. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last Friday of concealing weapons and ammunition in the shipments. AID denied that allegation, asserting the trucks were inspected and found to be free of lethal equipment by members of the Honduran clergy before the trucks departed the Honduran capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. The Sandinista government insists that inspections can be carried out only by the verification commission. In his letter to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> said he believes the shipments `` do not fall within the provision of the instruments which regulate the deliveries of humanitarian assistance.'' An AID official, speaking Wednesday only on condition of anonymity, said there was nothing in last month's agreement or the aid legislation which would preclude delivery of assistance to rebels in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The administration also has been worried about signs of increasing hunger among the thousands of rebel fighters. Many have crossed into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in recent weeks in search of food.

The House is also likely to approve restrictions on testing of anti-satellite weapons and ban all but the smallest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear tests, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> noted. Both amendments were also approved last year. Legislators on both sides noted that the amendments are virtually the same as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has considered in past debates over the Pentagon bill. `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is committed to arms control and he has proved it, convincingly, and everybody has to acknowledge that,'' said <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON>. He referred to the treaty signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> Dec. 8 which eliminates medium-range nuclear missiles, and to negotiations aimed at achieving a more far-reaching pact calling for deep reductions in long-range atomic weapons. Referring to Democratic critics of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON> said: `` Many of these true believers have been unable to recognize these new realities ... Some of these amendments are three years old. It's time to put them out of their misery. But <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> noted that `` the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is a partisan body and there are a lot of people here who feel very strongly about these issues.'' He suggested that the restrictions have had an impact. `` For example, I think we would have violated the SALT II limits by much more than we have without the pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said 18 months ago that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would no longer be restricted by the SALT II limits. The restrictions were tacked onto a bill authorizing $ 299.5 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending for the fiscal year that begins Oct 1. The total is about the same as this year's defense budget and it resulted from last December's `` budget summit'' between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> which was designed to lower the federal budget deficit. The bill that passes the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will have to be reconciled with the separate measure which will be passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. That chamber is moving more slowly on the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget, which is now being written by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Strengthened Legislation Against Housing Discrimination Clears
Committee</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two primary sponsors of fair housing legislation say they believe the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will act quickly on the measure, which would strengthen the ability of the government to fight housing discrimination. Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he would seek to send the bill to the floor within the next couple of weeks. `` This is a priority item,'' <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> said Wednesday after the committee approved the legislation 26-9. `` Realistically, we hope to have it up on the floor in two or three weeks,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the Judiciary civil and constitutional subcommittee `` This is civil rights legislation and this is an election year.'' Like legislation in 1980 that was derailed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure would empower the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> to levy fines and issue injunctions against those who discriminate in the sale or rental of housing. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> can only attempt to mediate disputes. The Justice Department can bring suits against individuals for a pattern of housing discrimination, and private individuals can bring their own lawsuits if they feel aggrieved. Wednesday's vote came after three days of meetings in which the Democratic-controlled committee fought off Republican efforts to gut or weaken the fair housing legislation. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsors of a similar measure, which passed the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> there nearly a year ago, do n't want to move until the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has completed its work. If the measure is to have any chance of passage this year, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> must act promptly. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration agrees that the housing laws need a better enforcement mechanism but opposes the plan in the bill. The measure would establish administrative law judges within the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> who would hear cases of alleged discrimination and then impose remedies. The administration, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> and their allies in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, led by Rep. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., say this approach may be unconstitutional because it could result in the imposition of a stiff penalty without a jury trial

<HEAD>US Negotiator Says Star Wars Program On Track</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The step-by-step search for a defense in space against Soviet ballistic missiles is on track and the first phase of the Star Wars program will be technically deployable between 1995 and 2000, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator said today. In a prepared speech to a major defense contractors group, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said research `` is not only alive but healthy and thriving'' in such areas as developing technology that can discriminate between Soviet decoys and nuclear warheads targeted on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON>, who advises President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, disputed published reports that the administration was scaling back the program, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative. Recently, he said, six key SDI technologies were approved by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> for demonstration tests to validate they would help shield the country from Soviet ballistic missile attack. He acknowledged that an unpublished report by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> last July identified some `` gaps'' in Star Wars technology. But <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant general who has participated in negotiations for 20 years, said development has moved quickly in the nine months since the report was submitted to the Pentagon. As an example, he cited an experiment known as Delta 181 that discriminated between decoys and warheads. <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said a high-level panel directed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s senior scientific advisory group, had recommended proceeding `` step-by-step as technology is developed'' for the Star Wars program. <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON>, addressing a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preparedness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, urged the contractors `` to get the truth out about SDI.'' He criticized reports in The Washington Post that the Pentagon was sharply scaling back its efforts to fulfill President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dream of rendering ballistic missiles `` impotent and obsolete'' with a space-based defense against them <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said reports of SDI's demise were `` dead wrong,'' But, he said, progress in key areas will be slowed or aborted if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> continues to fund the program below required levels. The first phase of the program would use kinetic energy and other futuristic technology to provide a partial defense against nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said deployment would `` greatly complicate'' the ability of Soviet military planners to executive a successful first strike of ballistic nuclear missiles against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Critics contend the program is fanciful, extremely expensive and a major stumbling block in negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to reduce long-range nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hopes to sign a treaty with General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the May 29-June 2 summit meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said the Soviets were `` still trying to hold offensive reductions hostage to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compliance with Soviet-defined limits on certain strategic defense research.'' He referred to the stand taken by the Soviets that the treaty contain a provision authorizing a suspension of the weapons reductions if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> concluded the Star Wars program violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has dismissed the demand as unacceptable. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plans a final pre-summit meeting with Soviet Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 11-12. <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said the Soviets were pursuing a defense program that costs an estimated $ 20 billion or so a year, including programs investigating many of the same advanced strategic defense technologies being explored in SDI.

<HEAD>High-Voltage Research: When Lightning Strikes, This Team Is There</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> does n't mind when people liken his research to that of <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, who pioneered lightning studies with a risky method involving a kite, a string and a key. Rust's methods are a bit more modern, but only a little less dramatic. When a violent thunderstorm threatens the nation's midsection, Rust and his fellow scientists set off in hot pursuit. The aim: To send weather balloons carrying packets of instruments into the heart of an electrical storm. By measuring the the overall electricity in the storms, and the charge on individual raindrops, scientists hope to learn about the the differences in behavior between large and small storms, said Rust, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. That, in turn, can help in predicting what the storms will do and in issuing warnings, <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Severe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. Rust said he hopes the work will help lead to better forecasts, `` bridging the gap between basic ivory-tower research and applications. Few would confuse his workplace with an ivory tower. This year's effort gets under way `` at the next storm which, if we're lucky, will be tomorrow,'' he said Wednesday. He will lead a seven-man team in a pair of vehicles, chasing the huge storms that sweep across the middle of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> hammering away with lightning and tornadoes. When one is reported, the team sets forth in a truck carrying an already inflated balloon in a box structure, and a van which has been gutted and refitted with an array of instruments. They try to locate the area under just the towering anvil cloud, and there they set the balloon free. The balloon is pulled into a large plastic tube to help hold it steady until release. -LRB- The team has released balloons in winds of more than 50 miles per hour. -RRB- Usually the balloon has to be pulled to an area away from trees and electrical wires. Once aloft, the balloon is tracked by radio instruments. Rust said lightning can interfere with the signals sometimes, though most data gets through. And some balloons become casualties of a trip into the storm, he said. Last year, when the research was started, one balloon disappeared `` in conjunction with a lightning flash'' in the cloud, Rust said. And others have been battered back to the ground by hail swirling around in the storm. But most survive to send back information. The project was launched last summer, with Rust and Dr. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> seeking to follow up studies of small storms done earlier in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Two types of balloons are being used this year, small 4-foot diameter balloons with instruments to measure the general electrical field in the storm, and larger 6 - or 7-foot versions to measure the charge on individual raindrops `` Measurements like that have never been made in severe storms,'' Rust said. `` We're trying to understand the electric structure of thunderstorms, in particular severe thunderstorms ... We want to know if they are significantly different from small thunderstorms or not.'' The large storms have some unusual lightning characteristics, he explained, and the scientists want to know if that is tied into the rainfall patterns of the storms, which is one reason they want to measure the electrical charge on raindrops. Severe storms tend to have a much higher share of intra-cloud lightning than smaller storms, Rust explained, adding that this seems to be associated with intensification of the circulation in the storm and possibly with formation of tornadoes. In addition, the severe storms sometimes produce lightning strikes to the ground with a positive charge, rather than the negative charge more commonly found in lightning, he said. There can be too much lightning, though, even for Rust. He admits having scrubbed a few launches last year when he considered it too dangerous. `` We are very cautious when releasing a balloon in a storm environment,'' he said. `` We try to use good judgment.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> seemed childlike two weeks before he died and was so ill he could barely speak and could n't put on his glasses or read, let alone approve of changes in his will, said the nurse who cared for him The flamboyant entertainer, who died Feb. 5, 1987, of AIDS-related complications, was a gaunt man who used what little energy he had left to smile at friends when they came to see him, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> testified Wednesday. `` It was just the disease, it knocked everything out of him,'' said the nurse, who began caring for <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> 13 days before his death and the day he named attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> as his executor. `` We would have minature conversations but he could only speak in syllables,'' she said. `` The motor coordination was going so he'd have difficulty speaking.'' Her testimony contradicted that of <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>, who said the famed pianist sat at a table in his <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strings </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, home that day, talking with him and going over the estate papers before signing them. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s sister, his former manager, two housekeepers and a long-time friend, have filed suit to remove <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> as executor with full control of the estimated $ 20 million estate. `` He'd say yes to anything to please -LRB- at that point -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>. `` He just wanted to please anyone and be left alone.'' `` He was so childlike he did n't know what he was saying,'' she said in describing the entertainer's dying days at his <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> home. According to provisions of the will made public Wednesday, three of the five received more in the death-bed will Strote drew up than in a will <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> executed in 1982. Under the revised will, <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> gave $ 650,000 to his sister, <PERSON> Angie </PERSON>; $ 250,000 to his companion of seven years, <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>; $ 60,000 to <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, his manager for 37 years, and $ 5,000 to <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, the housekeeper at his <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> home. He also left <PERSON> James </PERSON> two expensive cars and gave a house, furnishings and a car to the fifth plaintiff, <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Luckie </PERSON>, the housekeeper at his <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> James </PERSON> was not named in <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s previous will and <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was to receive $ 450,000 under the 1982 document. Ms. <PERSON> Luckie </PERSON>, who had been given the right to live in one of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s homes in the 1982 will, was given the house outright in the 1987 document <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> also left $ 50,000 in trust to take care of his seven dogs, which he often referred to as his `` babies.'' <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> has said that he has received more than $ 400,000 in legal fees from the estate and the <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> trust and is billing his services, including his time at the current trial, at $ 250 an hour. In his fourth day of testimony Wednesday, <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said $ 900,000 of the money owed the five plaintiffs had been set aside. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said he would seek to have the plaintiffs pay the extensive legal costs of the will litigation out of the $ 900,000 if the judge rules in his favor. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> defended the signing of the will and two trusts in the days before <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> died, and a doctor who examine the entertainer was convinced <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was `` in good condition and could understand'' the documents, <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said. `` I wanted to make sure he was physically able to go through the documents and understand them,'' <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> signed the will and two trusts, but balked at a fourth document, a living will that would allow doctors to remove life support systems if they became necessary. `` He said ` I just ca n't sign this,''' <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> recalled.

More events are planned Friday marking her 75th birthday, which she celebrated this past December. `` It think it's very fitting,'' <PERSON> Northington </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` This celebration is about all she's done.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said earlier this month she was inspired to beautify <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as first lady after returning from trips abroad with her husband. She said flowers light up a city the way lipstick does a woman, and her interests in beautifying the environment widened with the years: from the traffic circles and public buildings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to the coasts and the heartlands in between. With a donation of 60 acres east of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and $ 125,000, Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in 1982 helped found the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildflower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, an information clearinghouse where research is done on the role of native wildflowers in landscaping along the nation's roadways Proceeds from the Jubilee Celebration will benefit the center, <PERSON> Northington </PERSON> said.

 Federal railroad regulators say an accident that killed a veteran conductor last year and led to an ongoing rail strike in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was caused by a faulty brake. The Nov. 9, 1987, accident at the <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, freight yard has been at the center of a labor dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Guilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and unionized workers who charged that inexperience of a newly hired engineer led to the fatal accident. About 1,200 rail workers walked off the job three days after the accident to protest allegedly unsafe working conditions on the freight line. The strike, in its sixth month, is against <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> lines now under <ORGANIZATION> Springfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Both sides have attempted to use the tragedy to their advantage, and the irony is that the report really does n't support either position,'' <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Wednesday. `` The company is clearly liable for the faulty repair on the hand brake,'' said, but added, `` We found nothing to support the labor allegation that lack of experience or training by the engineer contributed to the accident.'' FRA investigators were unable to conclude if <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkinson </PERSON>, the veteran conductor and head of the three-member crew, properly blocked the boxcar to prevent it from moving. But the report said once the boxcar began to move, <PERSON> Hopkinson </PERSON> applied the hand brake without success. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said a working brake would have stopped the boxcar and prevented the tragedy, and that the problem could have caused the initial runaway. Investigators discovered that <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> repair crews failed to install the necessary weld on the brake system during repairs earlier in the year. After realizing the brake failure, <PERSON> Hopkinson </PERSON> _ who was on the runaway car _ radioed instructions to the engineer to speed up to the boxcar so the conductor could attempt to couple the two cars, which were moving at speeds that reached up to 25 mph. The report said the engineer, who joined the strike, did not contribute to the accident. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyden </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes the report incorrectly dismisses the engineer's role in the accident Guilford Vice President <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said the company was `` gratified'' by the report and agreed with its conclusions.

<HEAD>Israelis Increasingly Use Arabic Term For Uprising</HEAD>

 Many Israelis are using the Arabic word `` intefadah,'' or uprising, to describe the violent protests in the occupied lands, and Jewish and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> observers say the new terminology reflects a new attitude. `` It's an acceptance of the fact that we're not just talking about scattered disturbances, but a struggle against the occupation that involves everybody,'' said Palestinian editor <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Aker </PERSON>. When Palestinian unrest began in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Dec. 8, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> journalists and army officials referred to the clashes between Arab protesters and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops as `` disturbances.'' Such language reflected the initial Israeli perception that only a few activists, incited by outsiders, were involved in the protests, while the majority of the Palestinians remained passive. But in the last few weeks, more and more Israelis, including politicians and journalists, have spoken about `` intefadah'' when describing the protests in which more than 170 Arabs and two Israelis have been killed. In his Independence Day address to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents last week, President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> urged Palestinians to end the `` intefadah'' and said they must realize they are being misled by their leaders. A recent routine news item on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s armed forces radio read: `` Since the start of the intefadah, shopkeepers in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> have usually opened their shops for several hours in the afternoon.'' `` It's now part of the jargon. Everybody knows what intefadah means,'' said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>. `` The fact that they are using the Palestinian term means they are accepting the Palestinian definition,'' added <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> correspondent for the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Aker </PERSON>, an editor at the pro-PLO newspaper Al-Fajr, noted that in the first few weeks of the uprising, the Israeli censor routinely blue-penciled the word `` intefadah'' in his articles. `` About three months ago, they began to accept the word, and we now use it all the time,'' he said. Others rejected the political interpretation and said the use of the word `` intefadah'' was just part of the lively exchange between Hebrew and Arabic, two closely related Semitic languages. Hebrew and Arabic speakers in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the occupied lands often curse in the other's language and borrow greetings and terms of endearment from one another. `` I do n't think people go into the real meaning of the word intefadah,'' said <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Ami </PERSON> <PERSON> Gluska </PERSON>. `` People use it because they hear it.''

<HEAD>Committee Votes To Penalize Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru For Drugs</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> are failing to give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> full cooperation in the war on drugs, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee said in voting to impose aid sanctions against the three <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries. The votes Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to penalize the three countries were largely symbolic, since the legislation will unlikely clear other procedural hurdles and be passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before a May 13 deadline. But supporters said it would send a clear signal to the three governments that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is serious about combating the flow of illegal narcotics from abroad. And some hoped the move also would score political points in their drug-plagued congressional districts this election year. While the panel voted to impose aid sanctions on those three countries, it declined to penalize <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, both of which have been criticized for not `` fully cooperating'' with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-drug efforts as the law requires. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was said by committee members to have intervened to head off sanctions against <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, which had lobbied hard against the action. The <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> resolution passed 26-15, and the other two were approved by voice votes. In backing the sanctions legislation, the panel ignored warnings that penalties would only harm relations with allies and make it more difficult to secure cooperation in fighting the flow of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Passing these resolutions would make us feel better,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee `` We could go home and tell our constituents we struck a big blow against drugs.'' But he said allies `` are tired of being treated like banana republics by their great northern brother, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The chief sponsor of the sanctions bills, Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said they were the only way the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has to get the attention of countries which are the source of drugs pouring into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` Only when we prod do we get any reaction,'' argued <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who said <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> are the largest producers of coca leaves and coca paste, used to make cocaine. Potentially at stake for <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is half its foreign aid package, for which a total of $ 55 million has been requested by the administration for fiscal year 1989. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 1989 administration aid request is $ 20 million, and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s is $ 125,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly on April 14 to revoke President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s certification that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is fully cooperating with anti-drug efforts, but voted against taking similar action on the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. The certifications for the other three countries have not been addressed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Under a 1986 law, the president must certify annually that countries on a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> list of drug producing and trafficking points are `` fully cooperating'' with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-drug efforts in order for them to receive continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. If the president does not make such a certification, the countries can lose half their aid money, and can lose trade preferences and support for loans from international development banks. The president is given the power to head off sanctions by certifying it is in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security interests for aid to continue. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> certified March 1 that 17 of the 24 countries on the list were fully cooperating, including the ones debated Wednesday in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. The president certified another three countries on national security grounds, and withheld certification from just three countries _ <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ which get no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid.

 A generation after <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> learned the tricks of the oil trade from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a self-styled envoy from the heart of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil country has come to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to see how the cartel works. He's <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, a handsome, smooth-talking, 45-year-old former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressman who currently is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates that state's large petroleum industry. Ensconced in his hotel room in central <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> patiently awaits word on a twice-postponed appointment to see <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> oil minister who doubles as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> Exporting Countries. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> maintains its headquarters in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is a friendly group that's `` glad to have someone from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to have a dialogue with.'' But he finds it hard to adapt to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> officials' disregard for time schedules. He'd been told by <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>'s aides that he could see the minister after an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting that initially was set for 2 p.m., then rescheduled for 3 p.m., then 4 p.m. The session finally started about 5 p.m. He said he was still trying to adjust to what outsiders call `` OPEC time.'' <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> sees his mission as `` opening a dialogue'' with the cartel that many Americans view as an enemy of the West, and that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government refuses to deal with. `` We're not in love with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, but we need to have input'' into decisions by an organization that controls about 35 percent of the world's oil supplies, he said in an interview on Wednesday. `` I look at what's happened to our <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy'' since oil prices crashed in 1986, he said. `` No one else is going to be speaking up for the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and someone had to do something.'' A Republican, he ackowledges that `` I'm subject to criticism'' for talking with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> about ways to stabilize oil prices, in defiance of the stated wishes of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He said the two other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> are `` too cautious'' to undertake such a controversial venture. `` I was the one who thought of this idea last fall,'' he said. `` If I think of something that might work, I'll take a risk.'' <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> met on Monday with <PERSON> Fadhil </PERSON> <PERSON> Chabili </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> deputy secretary general who administers the cartel's secretariat. He also held separate meetings with the oil ministers of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, as well as with officials of non-OPEC oil-producing countries such as <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> says he has been impressed by the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers' knowledge of the business `` They have a good understanding of oil,'' he said. `` What they just ca n't understand is why a country that is the No. 1 oil consumer and the No. 2 producer does n't have an energy policy.'' <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government should be in direct and regular contact with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> as part of a national energy policy. `` If I were a farmer and I grew carrots, and that's all I did and there was one entity, one person, in the world that set the price of carrots, I would want to know that person and have some input,'' he said. He says <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will become increasingly important to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the next decade. He predicted that 65 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> oil supplies would be imported by 1992, up from 40 percent now. `` We have to have some imput ... rather than burying our heads in the sand and hope <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> treats us okay,'' he said. `` How have they treated us without -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- input? Not very well.'' He rejects suggestions that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not deal with an organization whose market-rigging methods it dislikes. `` We do n't agree with the Soviets. They're our enemies. But we still have a dialogue with them.''

 Some of the nation's financial markets are making changes aimed at reducing the risk of another collapse, but the new procedures could instead prove harmful, the chief of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative agency says. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, comptroller general of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday ways must be found to prevent a recurrence of last Oct. 19, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted a record 508 points. But he said that because the nation's stock, futures and options markets are closely linked, unilateral changes by individual exchanges are potentially dangerous. `` Because these changes have not been coordinated across markets, they have potentially adverse implications for intermarket stability,'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> told the lawmakers. `` These uncoordinated changes greatly concern us.'' As an example, <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> cited the limits in daily price swings that the futures markets have adopted but that the stock markets have not implemented. Supporters say the restrictions could stop markets from overreacting during uncertain times, but opponents say the limits could prevent investors from selling their holdings and cause panic. Such a disparity could cause `` an adverse transfer of buying or selling pressure'' from equity markets to the stock exchanges, he said. <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> also complained there was still no structure to resolve problems among the markets and develop a contingency plan to handle the next emergency. `` Decisions about what constitutes a market emergency, the types of actions to be taken and who will make the decisions are still not clear,'' he said. A White House working group, consisting of the heads of four federal agencies, is studying the problems faced by the nation's stock and futures markets Its eagerly awaited report is scheduled for release on May 18. `` Because that solution has not yet emerged, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should continue to keep pressure on the various parties through continued oversight so that progress toward a truly coordinated solution remains on track,'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> told the committee. Panel Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., circulated a proposed bill in February that would have created an <ORGANIZATION> Intermarket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> made up of the chiefs of the same agencies named to the White House group: the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> While saying he is willing to let federal and industry groups work out solutions to the market's ills, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said, `` If the spirit of cooperation breaks down, if they fail to make progress, then I'm prepared to force action with legislation.'' The ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, complained that small investors are still too frightened to invest in the market six months after the so-called Black Monday and no single overseer has been created to prevent future crashes. `` The whole pace has been extraordinarily leisurely, given the seriousness of the problem,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said.

The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> did n't say exactly where the target was located. The only failure in the test launchings occurred Jan. 21 when the third stage had an electronic problem. Today's launch was the second since then. Trident 2 is an intercontinental range missile, which is scheduled to become operational late in 1989 after nine more launch-pad tests and between five and 10 submarine test firings off the coast here. Each Trident submarine will pack 24 missiles, each of which will be able to hurl 10 nuclear warheads to different targets.

<HEAD>World Population Could Double In 40 Years, Research Group Says</HEAD>

 The world population could double to more than 10 billion people within four decades, say researchers who contend previous predictions of a slowdown appear to be wrong. `` The overall world population is growing faster than had been projected in the late 1970s and early'80s,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Haub </PERSON> of the private <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. The next billion could be added by 1998, said <PERSON> Haub </PERSON>, adding, `` That's really fast.'' The World Population Data Sheet, issued Wednesday by the bureau, said the doubling would occur if world population continues to grow at the current rate of 1.7 percent. It took all of human history to raise the world's population to 1 billion, which occurred in the early 1800s _ during the presidency of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>. More than a century was required to add the second billion, by about 1930, according to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> for Population Activities. Three billion were here by 1964, 4 billion in 1974 and 5 billion in 1987. There is a perception that world population growth was a problem of the 1970s, <PERSON> Haub </PERSON> observed in a telephone interview, `` so we thought it was time to point out that it's still growing faster than had been projected.'' The 1.7 percent rate of annual growth given by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, an independent, non-profit research group, is slightly higher than the 1.6 percent projected by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` That does n't sound like much,'' <PERSON> Haub </PERSON> pointed out. But in a world of 5 billion people, that difference represents 5 million more people per year. Population growth has n't followed the smooth trend downward that had been expected in many developing nations, <PERSON> Haub </PERSON> said. He noted in particular that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have high growth rates. `` Some of the larger countries have not followed a nice smooth path to the two-child family that we have been predicting,'' said <PERSON> Haub </PERSON>, noting in particular <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where previous reductions in births have not been maintained. The doubling of the world population in 40 years depends on growth continuing at the 1.7 percent ate, <PERSON> Haub </PERSON> said, a rate that varies considerably from country-to-country and region-to-region. The more developed nations, for example, are growing at 0.6 percent annually, for an anticipated doubling time of 120 years, the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheet </ORGANIZATION> shows. On the other hand, the less developed nations could double in just 33 years, at a growth rate of 2.1 percent. Increasing fastest are <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and the disputed territory of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, currently occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, each of which is expected to double its population in just 17 years at current rates of increase. At the other end of the scale, five countries are not growing at all _ <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. And <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, at its current rate, would not double its population for 3,465 years. Changes are hard to anticipate as various nations progress economically toward what population experts call the demographic transition. In early societies, high birth rates are generally balanced high death rates. As economic conditions provide better medical care and nutrition, death rates fall while birth rates remain high, leading to rapid population growth. Eventually, history shows, birth rates also begin to fall in a transition to balance again, as has happened in many more developed nations. Social, religions and other differences from nation to nation, however, keep this change from being a smooth curve, and help lead to the many variations around the world.

<HEAD>Study: Three-Day Hospital Stays Enough for Some Heart Attack
Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a study published today concludes. Doctors from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> studied the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home early. They found that these people had no unusual complications, got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills. `` It was an extraordinarily safe strategy,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Topol </PERSON>, the study's director. `` There were no problems with any serious events.'' <PERSON> Topol </PERSON> said the early discharges were made possible by two recent medical advances _ tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, and angioplasty. When given quickly after a heart attack, TPA can dissolve clots in the heart's arteries and minimize damage. Angioplasty can produce similar results by opening up the clogged arteries with tiny balloons. The report represents the latest in a steady three-decade trend of sending heart attack patients home from the hospital after ever shorter stays. However, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine said more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted. In the 1950s, doctors often recommended that patients stay in bed for one to two months after a heart attack. When President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in 1955, he spent seven weeks recovering in the hospital. However, doctors learned that long inactivity did more harm than good. Patients got out of shape, developed blood clots and became demoralized. In the 1960s, the stay was shortened to three weeks and in the 1970s to two weeks. Now, doctors typically keep heart attack patients hospitalized seven to 10 days. In their paper, the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heart attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for early discharge. None of them had irregular heart beats, chest pain or heart failure. Treadmill tests showed no signs of heart attack damage. Forty patients were sent home after three days, while the rest stayed seven to 10 days. After six months of followup, none had died, and the number of medical problems in both groups was similar. However, people in the early discharge group were able to return to work about two weeks sooner than the others, and their medical bills were significantly lower _ $ 12,546 versus $ 17,868. The researchers estimated that if 15 percent of all heart attack patients were discharged after three days, the annual saving would be at least $ 280 million. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curfman </PERSON>, a deputy editor of the journal, cautioned that the study was not large enough to spot complications that might result from reducing hospital stays. `` This single study,'' he wrote, `` is not sufficient to justify sweeping changes in current management practices for all patients who may at first appear to have uncomplicated'' heart attacks.

In a broadcast message Tuesday night, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> and archrival <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> to step aside in the name of party unity. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> suggested the party close ranks around a third candidate, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> said the convention was the only legal mechanism for deciding the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidacy. He referred to <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> as `` one member of the party.'' He said he met with <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> on Wednesday morning and that as soon as he left the president's office, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> entered. <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, both party founders and former cabinet ministers, have expressed confidence they will be selected at the convention. At least two party activists have been killed and several wounded in confrontations between followers of Rey and <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> since the internal campaign began last May. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> cited the infighting as a principal reason for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' loss to the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> in legislative and municipal elections March 20. The alliance, popularly known by its Spanish acronym <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, replaced the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> as the majority party in the legislature and won two-thirds of the mayoralties nationwide. `` Today our existence is threatened from within the party,'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said. `` The future of democracy in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is conditioned on the future of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. There is no truly democratic opponent in the elections of 1989,'' the president added. The only other party expected to field a presidential candidate is the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a small conservative group. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who is also the party's honorary president, said the candidacy of <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> or Rey `` would lead us to an electoral failure with grave implications for the democratic development of the country.'' He suggested <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, also among those who founded the party in 1960, as a unity candidate.

<TEXT>
 Chunks of shrapnel from unexplained explosions are hurtling through space at 22,000 mph and forcing designers to add tons of shielding to protect the proposed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space station and its crew. Nearly 7,100 pieces of orbiting debris are being tracked by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and more than half came from satellites or spent rockets that `` have blown up or broken up for unknown reasons,'' a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> expert says. More than 90 satellites to date have shattered unaccountably, but <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, project scientist for debris studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said he doubts the cause is collisions with meteoroids or tests of secret anti-satellite weapons. `` They are like a time bomb waiting to explode,'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` These explosions have occurred everywhere, from one day -LRB- after launch -RRB- to three years.'' Space station planners, `` faced with a considerable design problem,'' are adding 2,000 pounds to the shielding of each of the six modules occupied by astronauts. `` The debris gets most severe at 500-600 miles,'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said, `` but usually unmanned spacecraft are at that altitude and do n't require the same level of safety as a crew. The space shuttle generally operates at altitudes of 150 to 300 miles and so will the space station. `` When I first started working in this area, very few people knew how their spacecraft were breaking up, including the designers,'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said. `` The Space Command knew they were breaking up, but never took the time to identify why.'' He said officials have long believed that French-made Ariane rockets explode in space but their orbits are difficult to track with ground radar. Two years ago, however, an Ariane was launched into an easy-to-track orbit and, <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said, `` it blew up after nine months.'' The fragments of that explosion _ probably caused by over pressurization of gases _ number 450. Americans and Soviets contribute to the space junk, too. Six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Delta rocket second stages exploded, the last in 1981 _ three years after it was launched. The cause was leakage of fuels that burn when they combine and the problem was fixed in later models. Such explosions cause an expanding cloud of debris _ `` a problem analogous to cars driving around a parking lot in random directions _ you can get hit from any direction and the most likely direction will be head-on,'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said. The $ 1 billion space telescope scheduled to be put into orbit next year will operate 300 miles high. A study by the <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> concluded the instrument should be designed differently because of the debris, he said. Maj. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said 5,331 pieces of debris and 1,759 `` working payloads'' were being tracked as of April 19. The objects ranged in size from the Soviet Mir space station to a screwdriver dropped by a spacewalking astronaut. Space shuttle Challenger returned from a mission in June 1983 with a chip in a cockpit window and chemical analysis showed the culprit was a flake of the paint used on rockets and payloads. The few objects returned from space all have shown debris damage. The Palapa and <ORGANIZATION> Westar </ORGANIZATION> satellites that were retrieved by a space shuttle crew were pitted, but not damaged enough to keep them from functioning. The Solar <PERSON> Max </PERSON> satellite, repaired in orbit, showed many hits _ some penetrating an insulation blanket and damaging the surface beneath. `` A 3 millimeter particle has as much kinetic energy as a bowling ball going 60 miles an hour and if it hit an electrical component, it would probably cause that system to cease functioning,'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said. The average collision velocity would be 22,000 mph, he said.

 Bahamian Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> is being investigated by two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grand juries probing payoffs by drug traffickers, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today.

<HEAD>Study Finds Chubby People Have Sluggish Nervous Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New evidence that chubby people have sluggish nervous systems may help explain one of the great injustices of dieting _ why some people burn up calories more quickly than others. The study published today supports the theory that many fat people get that way because their bodies are extra-fuel efficient. Earlier research has documented that obese men and women often have lower metabolic rates. Their bodies use up less energy, even when they are doing the same things as ordinary-size people. So they need less food. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine and directed by Dr. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION>, may help explain at least part of how this happens. It shows that the fatter people are, the more lethargic their sympathetic nervous system, the internal thermostat that revs up the body in times of danger, stress or exertion. `` Their findings are consistent with recent evidence that indicates there is a biological difference between obese and lean,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Landsberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` This difference involves energy expenditure, and the sympathetic nervous system is important in regulating energy expenditure,'' he said. `` What they find shows diminished sympathetic activity, and that works into the overall equation.'' Dr. <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> agreed, saying, `` It's another piece of the puzzle that's been unlocked.'' Breathing, heart rate, contraction of the pupils and other involuntary bodily movements are under the control of the autonomic nervous system. This system has two main branches, the sympathetic system and the parasympathetic system, which balance each other. In general, the sympathetic system speeds things up, often in response to an emergency or exercise. The parasympathetic system does just the opposite, slowing down the heart and other organs. The sympathetic system prompts production of adrenaline and other hormones. Among other things, these natural chemicals signal the body's fat cells to give up some of their cargo so it can be burned as fuel. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>'s study measured adrenaline levels, heart rates and other factors under the control of the nervous system in 56 healthy men of varying sizes. It showed that the fatter they were, the less active their sympathetic nervous systems. Other scientists have tried but failed to find such differences in fat people. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said his findings should be replicated by other scientists, and added that the possible meaning of his findings is speculative. `` We have not proved that a disturbed autonomic nervous system maintains or causes obesity or causes some of the health hazards of obesity,'' he said. `` But certainly it's titillating to think that might be the case.'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> found that the parasympathetic system _ the other half of the internal control machinery _ is also turned down in fat people. Under his theory, an active parasympathetic system might help make people fat, while a lethargic one would keep them skinny. However, he theorizes that fat people have slow parasympathetic systems as well to balance their sluggish sympathetic systems. `` They got fat and stayed fat because their sympathetic nervous system tone was turned down,'' he said. `` As a response to that, they were able to turn down their parasympathetic nervous systems to reach a kind of equilibrium. That's quite speculative, but that's the way we think about it.''

<HEAD>Critics Say Massachusetts Plant-Closing Law Touted By Dukakis
Lacks Teeth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been wooing industrial-state voters by pointing to a plant-closing law in his home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and praising federal legislation requiring companies to notify workers 60 days before a plant shuts down. But the federal law is considerably tougher than the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> one, and that's the way the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor wants it. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law requests _ but does not require _ companies to provide workers with 90 days warning before a plant closing. Critics say the law lacks teeth. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' economic development adviser, <PERSON> Alden </PERSON> <PERSON> Raine </PERSON>, says a notification requirement in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> alone might lead companies to relocate, so <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does not support such a plan. Because there is no notification requirement, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration officials can offer no evidence the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> plant-closing provision has accomplished its goal. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says advance warning of plant closings is a basic worker right. `` Anybody who does n't understand that has really lost touch with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' he said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was in the same city last week, threatening to veto the trade measure that includes the plant closing provision, which won congressional approval on Wednesday. `` The irony is that he -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- chose to deliver that speech in the one state that has a comprehensive plant closing law,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, a spokesman for the administration's <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, could not say whether more companies are providing 90-day notice now than were before the law took effect `` There's no way to know,'' he said. `` You can only suppose we're doing better.'' In recent campaign stops in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, however, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> contended the law `` has saved 20,000 jobs and 200 companies.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defends his claim, saying troubled companies which receive state assistance must sign a non-binding pledge to give advance warning of plant closings. `` As a practical matter, there are some very real sanctions for companies who fail to give notice,'' he said. Former state Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> was a member of the committee established by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in 1983 as a result of a gubernatorial campaign promise to study the plant closing issue. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his top aides, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said, `` have been afraid of the hue and cry the business community would put up if they were ever treated roughly.'' Indeed, industry lobbyist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastrangelo </PERSON> said at a legislative hearing this week on toughening the state law, `` Does this commonwealth wish to send the signal to every single employer or potential employer that says, if you come into this state and can not survive economically, you will have to pay a penalty to get out?'' According to state officials, the plant closing law has not `` saved'' workers' jobs, but has helped some 24,000 find new employment after plant closings. The state worker retraining and relocation centers have found new jobs for about 77 percent of the workers who sought help. The new jobs pay, on average, 92 percent of their previous salaries.

<TEXT>
 The De Beer diamond cartel said it will raise prices for rough gemstones an average of 13.5 percent because a weak dollar has increased demand for their products in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. De Beers, based in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, controls 80 percent of the world's rough diamond market through its London-based marketing arm, Central Selling Organization. Sales of diamonds are priced in dollars and have been boosted by the drop in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency, which makes them cheaper to holders of Japanese yen and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies. De <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said the price increases for a broad range of uncut diamonds will take effect May 3. `` The increases are not weighted toward any particular category,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>. When De Beers last raised its prices, by an average 10 percent on Oct. 5, the biggest increases were for better-quality diamonds. That was the only price increase in 1987 and followed a jump of 14.5 percent, in two steps, in 1986. De Beers does not disclose its prices. But, as an example, the wholesale price of a polished, one-carat, D-flawless diamond _ the highest grade _ costs about $ 15,000. The cartel sets prices for rough diamonds only. It operates a pipeline of diamonds from its mines in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to dealers and cutters in the world's major diamond centers _ <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. `` The rough market is strong, the prices of polished diamonds are strong, retail demand is good,'' <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> said. `` Much of the motor for the momentum behind demand is coming from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.'' De Beers enjoyed record sales of $ 3.075 billion in 1987, up 23 percent from sales of $ 2.5 billion in 1986. Diamond sales, which slumped in the early 1980s, jumped even though <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Beers </PERSON> cut supply after the Oct. 19 stock markets' crash, <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> said. `` We carried that cautious policy through the early part of 1988. We reacted very quickly. What we would n't want to do is sell diamonds that the market could n't absorb.'' Jewelry sales generally were strong at Christmas, he added. `` The mood is optimistic and we would look foreward to 1988 being a good year,'' said <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>. De Beers holds about 10 `` sights'' _ or sales _ for international diamond dealers a year, <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> said. Most of the world's diamonds are industrial diamonds, used mainly for drilling because they are so hard. From 10 percent to 20 percent are gems.

 Hospital death rates in states with tight-fisted governmental controls are up to 10 percent higher, according to a study published today that prompted one doctor to comment, `` You ca n't have a <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> for Chevy prices.'' The study suggests, but does n't prove, that patient care suffers because hospitals in more cost-regulated states may try to hold down costs by laying off staff, eliminating services or spurning expensive equipment. `` There is cause for some concern,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shortell </PERSON>, the study's director. `` There is no need to frighten the public, but there is something here that does need to be dealt with.'' In efforts to lower medical costs, many states have set up review procedures for hospital rate increases. Others have certificate of need programs. These require hospitals to get approval for expansions or major purchases, such as new diagnostic machines, that cost more than a specific amount, often $ 500,000 or $ 1 million. The report did not provide state-by-state breakdowns. However, <PERSON> Shortell </PERSON> said that among the highly regulated states with the highest death rates were <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, head of pediatric intensive care at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Shortell </PERSON>'s figures `` are hard to dispute.'' He said he believes the public does not understand the consequences of cutbacks in hospital spending. `` If people want to make the choice to cut costs and have less medical care, that's all right, but they ought to be told the truth,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't have a Cadillac for Chevy prices. It's common sense. If you pay less, you get less.'' <PERSON> Shortell </PERSON>, a health services researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, published his findings in the New England Journal of Medicine. They were based on the records of 214,839 patients in 981 hospitals in 45 states. <PERSON> Shortell </PERSON> and his co-author, Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F.X </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, compared the actual death rates and the rates that would be expected based on the patient's ages, the severity of their illnesses and other factors. They found that the ratio of actual to predicted death rates in states with the most stringent rate reviews were 6 percent to 10 percent higher than in the least tightly controlled states. In states with the strictest procedures for reviewing applications for certificates of need, they found that the ratio of actual to predicted death rates were 5 percent to 6 percent higher than in those with more relaxed rules. The researchers looked at death rates for 16 medical conditions, including kidney and heart disease, that account for about 40 percent of hospital stays for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients. <PERSON> Shortell </PERSON> noted that 38 states have certificate of need procedures, although they vary in how severely they restrain hospital spending. Some of the programs, he said, permit such low levels of spending that `` it forces hospitals to go through more loops and discourages innovation. Some hospitals are not even applying to upgrade equipment. It may mean that it has some adverse effect on patient outcomes.'' In an interview, <PERSON> Shortell </PERSON> recommended a greater effort to monitor hospital death rates, especially in highly regulated states, to make sure there is no serious deterioration of patient care.

 A police officer has been found guilty of misconduct for leaving his post without permission to help his family during a flood and could be be dismissed this weekend. The <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> found <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Launius </PERSON> guilty Wednesday of eight counts of misconduct but left the question of his possible firing for a hearing Saturday. After the decision, defense attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakala </PERSON> said he was optimistic the eight-year veteran would get to keep his badge. `` He left his post. We have never denied that,'' <PERSON> Jakala </PERSON> said. `` When the commission considers the extenuating circumstances on Saturday, we hope he wo n't be fired.'' A dismissal has been recommended by Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozenczak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucansky </PERSON>, the chief's atttorney, said <PERSON> Launius </PERSON> is `` going to come in and show that maybe he did these things, but really he's a nice guy and a good cop. We'll try to show he's not.'' The three-member board found <PERSON> Launius </PERSON>, 31, guilty on charges including insubordination and failure to perform required duties.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> may be jeopardized by a battle here between a Damascus-backed militia and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s main Lebanese ally. The Shiite Moslem Amal militia, armed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, defeated the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, in a four-day battle in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> earlier this month. It was a big setback for the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hebollah </ORGANIZATION>, which aims to set up an Iranian-style Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, believed to contain various Shiite factions holding most of the 22 foreigners kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, now faces an Amal offensive in another stronghold _ the teeming slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which considers <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> its chief Arab ally, `` fears another sweeping attack by <LOCATION> Amal </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> enjoys relative freedom,'' according to a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Iranians sent <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jannati </PERSON>, a conservative cleric close to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, and Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheikholeslam </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to work out a deal with <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> sources, after a week of bargaining, Amal was still refusing to allow <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> back into the south. They said the Iranian team succeeded in forming a five-man committee to try to prevent future clashes in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. It is led by <PERSON> Sheikholeslam </PERSON> and includes <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s leader, Lebanese Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> But <PERSON> Jannati </PERSON> said on Tuesday the committee was being `` obstructed.'' The Shitte source said that remark indicated that <PERSON> Jannati </PERSON> `` has n't even won a solid promise from Amal that further crackdowns will be averted.'' If <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is defeated in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> area, its zone of influence will be limited to the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. That region is controlled by the Syrians who have about 25,000 troops there under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, has become increasingly alarmed at the challenge from <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Amal, with Syrian approval, moved against <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on April 4 after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> provided the fundamentalists with millions of dollars to fund welfare projects to win more Shiite support. The kidnapping in February of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer, Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who was serving with a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observer group, also angered <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> launched a dragnet for the kidnappers and rounded up <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> supporters it claimed were involved in the abduction. But there was no sign of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, whose abduction was claimed by a group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. After four days of fighting this month in which at least 62 people were killed, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> lost its strongholds in the region north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border. Amal's seizure of the south `` stripped <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of one of the main areas in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> where it had free rein to spread its influence,'' the source said. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is convinced that Amal would not have cracked down on <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in the south without <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> approval,'' he added. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is restricted to the southern slums. Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> sent 7,500 commandos with tanks into <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sector in February 1987 to end three years of militia anarchy One factor inhibiting an attack on the slums is the belief that most of the missing foreigners are held there and would be in danger if the Syrians tried to move in. Nine Americans are among the foreigners seized in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped on March 16, 1985. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is under mounting pressure from the Arab world to break with <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Iranians have provided the Syrians with 1 million tons of free oil a year since 1982. But <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, its own oil production rising after the discovery of new fields, is becoming less dependent on Iranian largesse. Embarrassed by the kidnappings, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has made clear that its patience with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s unruly allies is wearing thin.

<TEXT>
 The Soviet pullout from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> could trigger new regional turmoil or even a pre-emptive strike against <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s nuclear installations, says Pakistani opposition leader <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. There is great danger `` of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> becoming another <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with different factions holding say in different parts,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday at a news conference. Pakistanis generally expect the pro-Soviet government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to collapse after Soviet troops begin withdrawing next month, and when this happens different resistance groups may start fighting each other for power `` if some solution is not worked out beforehand,'' she said. `` If there is a vacuum ... it will be difficult for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to just ignore the situation,'' she said. `` On the other side, there are Persian-speaking Afghans. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> so far has not taken any deep interest in Afghan internal affairs, nonetheless it may find in a vacuum it is also tempted to exert its influence.'' With an <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> settlement, the nuclear issue `` threatens to become the most major foreign policy issue for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' bringing potential isolation and danger, she said. The danger comes from the threat of a cutoff of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> economic and military aid, erosion of credit with countries opposed to nuclear proliferation and vulnerability to `` pre-emptive action by outside countries,'' she said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off aid in 1977 and 1979 because of signs <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was developing nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law requires denying aid to countries making nuclear weapons. But the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> led to a swift turnabout, with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reluctant to damage ties with a government that has helped the Afghan guerrillas. While twice mentioning a potential pre-emptive strike against <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> avoided pinpointing potential attackers. Two countries, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, have been mentioned in occasional speculative news reports. `` Rather than aggravating to a point of conflict or pre-emptive action against <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, I think one should use diplomatic skill to go to the root of the problem to secure our security,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> added. If <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> were willing to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would also sign, and `` there would be no problem,'' but for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to sign unilaterally is difficult politically, she said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ul-haq </PERSON>'s government has often denied <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is developing nuclear weapons, but Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> suggested the denials are ambiguous. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> in a 1977 bloodless coup overthrew Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s late father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, and declared a martial law that was lifted only in 1986. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was hanged in 1979 after being convicted of ordering a political murder. The Peoples Party founded by <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and later led by his widow and daughter is the most secular of several political groups emerging in the predominantly Moslem country.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Consent Decrees On All-Terrain Vehicles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An agreement banning the sale of unsafe three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles until they meet safety standards and requiring warnings for operators of the four-wheeled variety will be allowed to go into effect. `` No decree designed to protect consumers has ever gone this far in meeting such a massive national consumer problem,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said Wednesday after approving the agreements with some modifications. The settlement between the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and five manufacturers has been criticized by consumer groups and lawmakers as providing inadequate protection or compensation for owners of the vehicles known as ATVS. The consent decree bans the sale of three-wheel ATVs unless the manufacturers can devise performance standards that are approved by the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION>. The decrees also require warning labels on four-wheel models. Distributors must provide training in the safe use of all types of ATVs to owners who purchased the vehicles after Dec. 30. 1986. They also require the manufacturers to spend $ 8.5 million to warn consumers about the hazards of ATVs and promote training. There are an estimated 2.4 million ATVs in use in this country, including 1.5 million three-wheel models. They have been blamed for 1,000 deaths and 300,000 injuries requiring handling at a hospital emergency room. One consent decree is with four Japanese firms and their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> divisions _ <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. LTD, <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. LTD. and <ORGANIZATION> Kawasaki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> The other decree is with <ORGANIZATION> Polaris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, a U.S.-based manufacturer. The revised consent decree eliminates a provision that allowed the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> to initiate a general recall only if it found `` new and substantial evidence'' the vehicles were hazardous. It also bars the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> from initiating a so-called generic recall of ATVs before Dec. 31, 1990. The original decree empowered the agency to take such action a year after the agreement received court approval. Another modification requires the distributors to require dealers in new or renewed franchise contracts to warn customers of the hazards, specifically to children, of ATVs and to ensure the vehicles bear the required safety labels. The original decree had required the manufacturers to make their `` best efforts'' to get the dealers to implement these requirements.

 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed at an all-time high Thursday, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar edged down in trading against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 54.80-points Wednesday, added a healthy 242.15 points, or 0.89 percent, to close the day's session at 27,434.12. The closing level surpassed its previous high of 27,246.77 reached on Tuesday. The dollar finished at 124.82 yen, down 0.17 yen from its close on Wednesday. `` Investors see no reason to sell their shares. The second consecutive advance on Wall Street overnight also gave a boost to the market,'' said a stock analyst at a securities house, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But the analyst said institutional investors _ main market players _ largely remained on the sidelines in advance of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s holiday-studded `` Golden Week.

The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar opened at 124.83 yen, down 0.16 yen from Wednesday's close, and finished the morning session trading at 124.86 yen. An exchange dealer with a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said the dollar likely would trade in a narrow range in the absence of fresh news to affect the market prior to the holiday week.

 The woman accused of killing her husband with a cyanide-spiked painkiller tearfully told a courtroom that she watched him collapse, never knowing that he was dying. `` Babe, I feel like I'm going to pass out,'' <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, testifying Wednesday at her <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial, quoted her husband as saying before he collapsed at their home June 5, 1986. `` He squatted down ... shook his head,'' she said. `` He would n't answer me He stood up. ... I pulled him back toward the door ... he put his hands on the couch to brace himself and collapsed.'' When he did n't revive, she said, she telephoned for help. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 44, who is accused of killing her husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, and a woman with cyanide-laced Excedrin capsules, tearfully told the jury that she never talked of murdering him and had researched cyanide poisoning only after his death. Prosecutors expected to begin cross-examining Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> today. She is charged with causing two deaths by tampering and three counts of tampering with a product involved in interstate commerce. She's the first person in this country to be tried on charges of causing death by tampering with over-the-counter medicine. If convicted, she could face life in prison. Sue <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, died after swallowing a cyanide-tainted Excedrin capsule two weeks after <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>. Prosecutors say Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> poisoned other over-the-counter pain relievers to make her husband's death appear the work of a random killer. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> described her 52-year-old husband as a loving, good-natured man with a sense of humor. She denied telling family members her marriage was unhappy or had grown boring since she and her husband stopped drinking alcohol in 1979. `` I believe that my feelings grew a lot stronger'' after the drinking stopped, she said. `` We got along a lot better.'' She acknowledged periodic financial stresses, including a 1983 bankruptcy filing, but denied that their money troubles threatened the marriage or that she saw collecting on his life insurance as an easy solution. Prosecutors contend she killed her husband in hopes of collecting up to $ 176,000 in benefits, and forged his signature on insurance paperwork. She said she signed the forms with her husband's permission because he `` despised paperwork.'' She said she thought he had only $ 25,000 in life insurance. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, testified Tuesday that her mother had discussed several possible ways to kill <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, asked Wednesday if she had ever told her daughter that she intended to poison her husband with cyanide, or that she had attempted to kill her husband, replied, `` No.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> also testified her mother discussed copying the unsolved Chicago-area poisonings in which seven people died from cyanide-laced Tylenol, and also asked how to hire a hit man and where she could buy heroin. And, Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said, her mother mulled the possibility of putting a cocaine overdose in <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s iced tea. In other testimony Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> specialist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said 84 fingerprints belonging to Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> were found on 47 pages of `` Deadly Harvest,'' a book about poisonous plants. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> said her prints were found on the book because she hoped to protect her granddaughter and children for whom she babysat from any such plants around her suburban <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, the prosecution's final witness, also said her fingerprints were found in three encyclopedia volumes concerning poisons. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> said she researched cyanide only after <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s death because `` I wanted to know what it was that killed my husband.

 Law enforcement officials have a message for drug pushers living in public housing projects: go out of business or get evicted. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals seized apartments at city housing projects on Wednesday as a joint federal-city force arrested the occupants on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Popolizio </PERSON>, chairman of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, said the seizure `` sends out the word to drug abusers: get the hell out of our housing projects and get the hell out of the City of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>!'' Tenants had complained about drug trafficking, prompting the investigation that led to the seizures, officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said the action was `` as far as I know, the first in the nation'' using civil provisions of federal drug laws to seize the lease of a public housing apartment. `` It will not be the last,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said at a news conference. However, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, questioned the evictions. `` We believe seizing someone's property or property interest because he has been accused of being a drug dealer is a serious violation of civil liberties,'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said. `` It turns the presumption of innocence upside down.'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said the apartments were seized, the occupants removed and the locks changed under a federal civil statute that allows seizure _ and forfeiture upon a conviction _ of property used in the commission of drug law violations. He said the statute had been used previously to seize private houses, cars, boats and planes. The announcement came shortly before a police sergeant was shot to death in an apartment while searching for cocaine. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, head of the narcotics unit in <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s office, said the shooting was not related to the eviction program. Marshals seized an apartment in a seven-story building on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Lower East Side, and the city-federal officers arrested its lone tenant, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Deanne </PERSON>, 28, for heroin trafficking. In a 20-story building in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 49, was arrested for cocaine trafficking and his apartment seized. Both were charged with drug trafficking, conspiracy and maintaining a location for narcotics use and distribution, authorities said. According to court papers, both have previous narcotics arrests and each faces a maximum 60-year prison sentence if convicted of all the charges brought Wednesday. One of Ms. <PERSON> Deanne </PERSON>'s neighbors who would not give her name, said drug dealing in her building was so rampant she was afraid to go out into the hall to put out the garbage unless her father was watching. `` There were a lot of drugs and stuff,'' she said. `` It was a scary thing when you have children.'' Ms. <PERSON> Deanne </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Deanne </PERSON> was the mother of a 6-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl and had been a `` loving, caring girl until drugs destroyed her.'' Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the new tactic showed `` our intent is to raise the cost'' of drug trafficking `` to the level where it is no longer profitable.'' Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said at the news conference that drugs were `` the scourge of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' and fighting narcotics has `` the highest priority at City Hall. ... We're never going to give in.''

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said that if government and rebel negotiators bargain in good faith when talks resume in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, an agreement can be reached to end the civil war. In a statement issued on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> and other rebel military commanders declared their support for the three-day peace talks, which were to resume today in the capital of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. But the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, remain far apart on essential issues, largely because of the vaguely worded peace agreement reached March 23 that they are trying to implement. Rebel leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> leads the Contra negotiating team and Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the president's brother, leads the government side. Contra leaders were to arrive in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> today on a flight from <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Government security agents on Wednesday took over the Camino Real Hotel, site for the talks, and told guests to find other accommodations. President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told reporters on Wednesday, `` If there is good faith on both sides to achieve peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> a definitive cease-fire can be reached.'' The 6 -LCB- - year-old civil war has claimed 26,000 lives But he complained that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` continues to support the warmongering actions of military leader <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> ... We hope that peace will prevail over this policy.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s comments came during a ceremony inaugurating the Benjamin Linder Memorial Park in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>, an electrical engineer from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, was killed along with six Nicaraguans on April 28, 1987, when rebels attacked the small town of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cua </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Jinotega </LOCATION> province. The two sides _ Contras and <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> _ have been in contact since their first meeting in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> two weeks ago. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> met privately with rebel leaders in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> this week to prepare the agenda and discuss points of friction such as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid to the rebels on the Honduran side of the border. One stumbling block in the talks concerns the rebels' giving up their weapons. Neither the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> pact, named for the southern border village where it was signed, nor the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace plan ratified last August by the region's five presidents, mentions that key issue. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> say both plans imply the rebels must lay down their arms. The Contras say the agreements mean they will disarm once <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is on the `` irreversible role to democracy.'' `` The Contras took up arms because there is n't any democracy,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Huembes </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization of opposition groups. `` It's ridiculous that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> wants to first discuss a cease-fire. They just want surrender.'' In seven meetings over the past month, <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> military representatives have agreed only to create seven safe zones in <LOCATION> Nicargua </LOCATION> into which the rebels are to move. They have not worked out resupply or operating conditions within the zones. Under the terms of the Sapoa accord, Contras in the zones can receive only humanitarian aid through `` neutral organizations.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> want the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to administer those supplies. Last week, President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of violating the agreement by sending food and other supplies to Contra fighters just across the border in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The Sandinistas have proposed extending to July 1 a cease-fire that was to have ended a month earlier and want the rebels to turn their arms over to a verification commission. The Contras offered no counterproposal that was made public. The government has pledged tentative measures aimed at satisfying, at least in part, rebel demands for `` democratization.''

<HEAD>Lindstrand Hopes To Add To Hot-Air Records With Ascent Over Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hot air balloonist Per Lindstrand is hoping to reach new heights this June with a 60,000-foot ascent over the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prairie. The 39-year-old Swedish engineer, who risked drowning in a record-setting voyage across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> last year, will face the danger of decompression as he tries to go 4,876 feet higher than ever flown in a hot-air balloon. The altitude record for hot-air balloons is 55,134 feet, set in 1980 by Englishman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Nott </PERSON> in a flight from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Lindstrand will make the voyage in an enclosed, pressurized aluminum gondola, navigating and maneuvering his 120-foot-high balloon through instruments. The balloon, with a surface area of 35,000 square feet, would be made of a special foil-coated fabric that will improve the balloon's heat retention. The adventure, scheduled to unfold about 27 miles north of <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, in early June, was outlined at a news conference Wednesday. Balloonists have been unable to get higher because a shortage of oxygen causes the burners that heat the air inside the balloons to extinguish at the high altitude. <PERSON> Lindstrand </PERSON> said new technology and techniques he has developed over the last five years should allow his balloon's burners to continue well beyond 55,000 feet. `` The biggest risk is obviously high-altitude decompression,'' Lindstrand said. A sudden capsule decompression at 60,000 feet could cause the craft to explode outward because of the difference in air pressure. Even short of an explosion, sudden decompression could cause Lindstrand to lose consciousness within seconds and cause death within minutes, organizers of the trip said. Lindstrand will be wearing a pressurized suit. The most critical factor may be the weather, he said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brice </PERSON>, the project's weather expert, said that nearly flat, calm wind conditions will be needed to make the flight successful because the huge balloon will be extremely difficult to control as it comes in for a landing. Depending on wind conditions, the organizers said the balloon may land as far as 100 miles from where it will be launched. <PERSON> Lindstrand </PERSON> said the plans call for the balloon to make a `` cold descent'' from more than 60,000 feet to about 11,000 feet when the burners will be restarted to proceed with a landing. If the burners ca n't be restarted to further slow the descent, Lindstrand would abandon the capsule at about 4,000 feet and parachute to earth. Lindstrand last year attracted worldwide attention with a record-breaking flight across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. It was the first time anyone had made such a trip in a hot-air balloon although three previous flights had been made in helium baloons. The trans-Atlantic trip almost ended in tragedy when the balloon descended from 27,000 feet, scraped along the Irish countryside and then plunged into the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Lindstrand and fellow balloonist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> were forced to jump into the water and later were rescued. Lindstrand swam for more than two hours against strong currents before being picked up by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Lindstrand's records as a hot-air balloonist are for the fastest flight, averaging 100 miles per hour; the farthest flight of 3,075 miles; and the longest flight of 31 hours, 41 minutes.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s key stock market indicator closed at its highest level yet today following the overnight advance on Wall Street, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar edged down in trading against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 54.80 points Wednesday, added a sharp 242.15 points, or 0.89 percent, to close the day at 27,434.12. Its previous high of 27,246.77 points was reached Tuesday. `` The stable currency exchange and the good condition on Wall Street boosted the market,'' said <PERSON> Keiji </PERSON> <PERSON> Arai </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sanyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Fundamentals are very good in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market, and bad news from the outside such as the passage of the omnibus trade bill by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, did not affect share prices much because of strong buying pressure, he added. Popular issues were steels, heavy electricals and shipbuildings. Precision machineries, textiles, foodstuffs were higher. Papers, real estates, trading houses and securities were also firm. Some of the department stores and drugs lost ground. Volume of the first section trading was estimated at 800 million shares, up from 750 million shares on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the dollar ended the day at 124.82 yen, down 0.17 yen from its close on Wednesday. It was little changed from the 124.83-yen opening level. During the day, it ranged between 124.78 yen and 124.93 yen in light trading. Trading was thin in the absence of fresh incentives to affect the market, said an official of a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the dollar moved in a narrow range prior to the Golden Week, which starts Friday. Banks and financial institutes will be closed for most of the week, which will see four holidays in seven days beginning Friday. On Saturday, trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> will take place during the regular half-day session, and Monday will be a regular business day.

 Wildlife biologists blasted gas-powered cannons to frighten birds from nesting marshes where a 175,000-gallon oil spill has killed at least 130 birds, as a frantic cleanup continued under threat of rain. A <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> official, meanwhile, said Wednesday that the spillage of thick crude in coastal wetlands about 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> occurred Saturday after operators of an oil tank violated the company's written rules. `` The unanswered policy question is how and why the plant's practice came to deviate so drastically from company procedures,'' plant Manager <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Banducci </PERSON> told reporters during a tour of the storage area at the <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> refinery. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>, principal engineer of the state <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, called the spill during the nesting season an `` ecological disaster'' in which damaged areas may take a year or more to recover. <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> and other officials said they fear rain and high tides will spread the oil now largely trapped in <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> <PERSON> Slough </PERSON> and shorelines of <LOCATION> Carquinez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> to environmentally sensitive bird sanctuaries farther north and west. Extra teams of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, totaling about 50 members, arrived Wednesday to help the 100 <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> workers already involved in the cleanup of the patchy 12-mile stretch of oil. `` We've got a long way to go, and we're trying to get there as fast as we can,'' Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Broddrick </PERSON> of the state Fish and Game Department said Wednesday. State wildlife biologists set up a dozen `` zon'' guns, propane gas-powered cannons, to scare birds away from <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> <PERSON> Slough </PERSON> and marsh, where about 80,000 gallons of the oil have been trapped by man-made booms in the water. By Wednesday night, about 400 oil-coated birds had been rescued from the marsh and about 130 of them had died, according to Capt. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Zawadzki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. At least two dozen turtles, marsh mice and muskrats also were found dead. The spill occurred when oil tank workers left the valve open to a line designed to carry rainwater off the top of the tank into the slough, <PERSON> Banducci </PERSON> said. The line, which passes through the tank, ruptured and the oil escaped through it undetected, according and <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>. The refinery's procedures call for the releases of water to be regulated by manual control. The wrong method was used only at tank 1256, the source of the spill, and a twin that sits next to it, said <PERSON> Banducci </PERSON>. Rainwater for 173 other oil storage tanks is either collected in basins and checked before discharge or sent to a treatment plant. `` This was most definitely not an individual operator error,'' <PERSON> Banducci </PERSON> said, adding that a <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> safety committee is evaluating the spill and will issue a report on how it occurred later. <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> estimated the cleanup could cost <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> $ 4 million or more, including $ 3 million in penalties. He said a temporary dam may have to be built at the mouth of the slough in case persistent high clouds turned to rain. However, rain was not expected through Friday, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Beatrice Mails First Checks from Game-Contest Lawsuit; Big Winner</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As contests go, `` Monday Night Winning Line-up'' was a bust for sponsoring <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, a boon for about 2,400 players and a few hours' work for a few lawyers. The attorney for most of those winning players said Wednesday the first checks were in the mail from the $ 2 million settlement that stemmed from <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s cancellation of the game two weeks ahead of schedule. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Leck </PERSON>, who filed their class-action lawsuit, said individual checks would range from $ 130 to $ 32,000. But `` Line-up'' costs may have gone well beyond $ 2 million. Player <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON>, who said he'd broken the game's pattern and scratched clear 4,018 winning entries worth more than $ 16 million, reached a separate settlement with the company for an undisclosed sum. The case was settled on terms that are confidential, said <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> in the earlier case. `` The decision to keep everything confidential was a mutual one,'' said <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> from her <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office. But <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> apparently did well enough to leave his job late last year and go into semi-retirement at age 25, a friend said. His lawsuit was filed against <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>, now known as BCI, on Dec. 26, 1985. <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> accused the Chicago-based food and home-product conglomerate with breach of contract because it canceled the contest Nov. 29, nearly two weeks before the Dec. 6 deadline mentioned on the back of the game cards. The promotion offered prizes ranging from food coupons to a Super Bowl trip for eight in a private jet, or cash equivalents. In a widely distributed newspaper advertisement, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> said it was canceling the contest because it had learned the game could be manipulated. That revelation came from <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON>. `` I told them what I had done, offered to show them how I'd done it and told them I wanted to negotiate for less money than I had -LRB- in winning cards -RRB- at the time,'' <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> said at the time. `` I think they believed me,'' he added, `` but they kind of blew me off.''

But one friend who spoke on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> had `` gone back north where he's from and is taking it easy. ... `` He does n't want to be found,'' the friend said. `` Line-up'' required players to scratch the cards' surface to correctly pick the winners and the number of touchdowns and field goals in eight televised National Football League contests. <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> said he broke `` Line-up'' by finding there were only 309 variations. He then made a completely scratched-off master card for each of the 309. By scratching clear the first game on a given card, he knew which variation he held. Experts said <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> made two basic mistakes with `` Line-up.'' First, the company should have used a computer to generate an infinite variety of game-card patterns. Secondly, the cards omitted language that would have limited <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s liability. `` This ranks right up there with some of the big promotional foul-ups in recent memory,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Blashek </PERSON>, executive vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Ventura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based contest and sweepstakes-planning service, said Wednesday.

 Polls are pointing to a potentially close general election race between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> more hindrance than help as a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee. Voter opinions change in the course of a campaign, and the recent round of surveys testing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with and without <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, may bear no resemblance to the outcome six months from now, pollsters said in interviews this week. But the polls do establish a benchmark from which future movement can be judged, they said. And taken in context, the polls can highlight candidate strengths and weaknesses, providing clues to the campaign's likely course. `` We're not clairvoyant. This the way it is right now. It's April It's not November. It's close in April,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll chief <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON>. `` If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was trailing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 20 points, we could say something now.'' That lack of a big lead for the better-known <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is one important result of the recent polls. `` It's not too early to know that it's a close race,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll director <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitofsky </PERSON>. `` Obviously things are going to happen between now and November that will change this. That's what campaigns are all about. But it's fair to conclude that there's going to be a contest. The biggest spread between the likely nominees was in a poll conducted April 21-22 for Time magazine: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had an 11-point lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 50 to 39. A Gallup poll April 21-23 showed a virtual tie, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 45, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 43, as did a <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today-CNN </ORGANIZATION> poll April 20-21, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 45, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 43. The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points for each of the three polls. History demonstrates that such early polls do n't always predict the result. In late May 1984, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll put <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> 11 points behind President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> among likely voters. Immediately after the Democratic convention, <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, on a crest of good publicity, pulled even with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in some polls. But he lost in November by 18 points. During the campaign, <ORGANIZATION> Mitofsky </ORGANIZATION> noted, <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> came out for higher taxes. A similar `` silly'' move could cost <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> just as dearly, he said. Because many voters have not made firm choices thus far this year, poll numbers are liable to `` jump around,'' partly through differences in survey methods, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>, Gallup's president He said that could explain the <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> poll's relatively large lead for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. More important, while polls `` are a pretty good indication of how voters feel today,'' <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON> said, `` you have to keep in mind what today represents.'' The polls were done shortly after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' big win in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and thus amid considerable positive publicity for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON> noted. In contrast, there was little news of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that week. The result: a favorable bias for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. That may change, <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> said, as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> becomes better known and undergoes more critical scrutiny. The polls' key message for the moment, he said, is that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not the shoo-in some analysts thought him to be. `` One of the myths of the election was that the Democrats ca n't win,'' <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> said `` The Democrats can win. I think people are beginning to see that now.'' There is less agreement among pollsters on surveys that suggest vice presidential candidates. <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> said other polls have indicated that most voters solely consider the presidential nominee: Even the dramatic choice of <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee in 1984 seemed neither to help nor hurt the ticket. Nonetheless, the recent polls did indicate an impact if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ran as the vice presidential candidate. While the Gallup poll showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> about even when their names alone were given, a proposed ticket of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, had a 10-point lead over a Dukakis-Jackson ticket, 50-40. The <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today-CNN </ORGANIZATION> poll, asking about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with an unnamed running mate against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, had the Republicans up 49-42. The Time poll, done the same way, had the Democrats ahead 47-42, but had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> farther ahead of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> without <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the ticket. `` I think it's clear ... that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> hurts the ticket,'' said I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, pollster for The Los Angeles Times. Also, because opinions are not fully formed, the proposition of a Dukakis-Jackson ticket right now may be drawing uncritical support from both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters, he said. `` What you're not measuring now is the people who like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but not <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, or the people who like <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> but not <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said.

 Sri Lankans voted today for provincial councils in an election boycotted by most opposition parties. More than 15,000 policemen were deployed in four provinces where 2.8 million voters were eligible to select 155 council members. During the campaign at least three people were killed by a guerrilla group. Only six of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 18 political parties took part in the election. The other parties boycotted, saying President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> should hold general elections before the district councils are formed. Elections in three more districts are scheduled for June 2. Balloting was postponed indefinitely in the northern and eastern provinces, where Tamil separatists are waging a civil war and where most of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 2.8 million Tamils live. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perara </PERSON>, deputy inspector general of police, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that all possible security measures had been taken to frustrate any attempts by the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to disrupt the balloting. The front, an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese group, tried to disrupt the campaign by killing at least three people in recent weeks, police said. The front also was accused of the unsuccessful attempt on <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s life in a grenade attack last August. The front opposes the accord mediated by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and signed by <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> last July that aims to end nearly five years of guerrilla war by the island's minority Tamils for an independent homeland. The front contends that the accord makes too many concessions to the Tamils. The accord calls for Tamils to lay down their weapons in exchange for creation of the district councils, which are to give people some say in local government affairs. The largest Tamil rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> has rejected the pact, and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has sent more than 50,000 soldiers to the island to put down the rebellion. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, Defense Minister K.C. Pant renewed <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s offer to the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> to resume peace talks but repeated <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s demand that the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> first surrender their weapons and accept the accord. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, say they are discriminated against by the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON>, who are Buddhists and control the federal government and the military. The four districts where elections are being held today were the <LOCATION> Northwestern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> North-Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> and the Uva and <LOCATION> Sabaragamuwa </LOCATION> districts in the south. Parties taking part in the balloting include <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s govering <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the opposition <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group of three smaller leftist parties and the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> Moslem <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> The single largest opposition party, the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, joined the boycott.

<HEAD>Extradition Approved on 39 Murder Counts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former Argentine general who was his nation's most wanted fugitive for three years can be extradited to face charges in 39 killings that occurred during seven years of military rule there, a judge ruled. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> on Wednesday granted <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s request for the extradition of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. On Monday, a federal judge here ordered <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> to pay $ 21 million in damages to a lawyer who was tortured at Argentine prisons under the general's command during the 1970s `` dirty war'' against leftists. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s claim that the crimes for which he was wanted in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> were political and therefore exempt from extradition. The exception for political offenses does not apply to `` deaths that occurred to disarmed prisoners,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> has submitted no evidence to implicate any of the homicide victims in any sort of violent or revolutionary activity,'' <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said. `` Thus, there is absolutely nothing in the record which would support a finding of a rational nexus between the homicides and any uprising which may have been occurring,'' he said. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, 64, is not charged with personally committing any of the killings, but he issued a secret 1977 order making his office responsible for choosing the targets of raids, whose victims were often kidnapped and killed, <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said. The former general also was responsible for the construction of detention centers used to hold civilians, the judge said. <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> refused to block extradition while the ruling is appealed, but defense lawyers said they expected to get an immediate stay from the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. An appeal could take as long as a year. `` This is merely a temporary setback,'' said J.T. <PERSON> Prada </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s lawyers. He said <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, who listened to a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> translation of Wednesday's hearing on a headphone, was `` a little bit upset; you ca n't blame him.'' <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> rejected four other murder charges sought by <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, ruling that the victims could not be identified. Under extradition law, <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> can be tried only on charges for which extradition is approved. The final decision on extradition is up to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` Justice has been done,'' said <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez-Baca </PERSON>, a former Argentine lawyer who won the $ 21 million award in his civil suit. <PERSON> Martinez-Baca </PERSON> had been held four years in <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s prisons and tortured. Two other civil suits by former Argentinians are pending against <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, who contends he has no money. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s most wanted fugitive during his three years of freedom before his arrest in January 1987 and is the highest-ranking former military officer currently facing trial by the civilian government. He was not covered by the amnesty granted by the government to lower-ranking military officials. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> commanded the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and oversaw military prisons in the <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> district from 1976 to 1979. He was summoned to a military tribunal after a civilian government came to power in late 1983, but fled. He was arrested last year in <LOCATION> Foster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where he was living under an assumed name. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s lawyers offered two defenses against extradition: that he was not responsible for his soldiers' actions; and that the actions were `` political,'' and therefore exempt from extradition under the U.S.-Argentina treaty, because they were in response to alleged threats of a leftist takeover. Defense lawyers offered evidence of numerous attacks against government and military installations and business leaders, before and after the 1976 military coup.

<TEXT>
 Small bombs exploded today in three bars in this northern Basque city, causing substantial damage but no injuries, police said. The Basque separatist organization <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility. The first blast occurred at 5:30 a.m. in the <LOCATION> Balanza </LOCATION> bar in the <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Ocharcoaga </LOCATION>. A second explosion 15 minutes later heavily damaged the <LOCATION> Amaya </LOCATION> bar in the nearby suburb of <LOCATION> Basauri </LOCATION>. A third explosion occurred about 40 minutes later in the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corona </LOCATION> bar in central Bilbao, police said. Police defused a fourth bomb in the International bar in <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION>. In a telephone call to a local travelers aid office, a man who identified himself as a member of <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> said the group planted the four bombs. Police said the same person called them to tell them where the fourth bomb was located. Since taking up arms in 1968, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for numerous bombings and shootings in Basque and <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> cities, killing more than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, which stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque language, has been seeking independence for three provinces in northern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> and Queen <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> strayed from their royal schedule during a tour of <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> to explore a ghost house and take an interstellar flight of fancy. A quick tour of the Magic Kingdom had been scheduled for Wednesday, and at the outset the king appeared somewhat uncomfortable as he posed with <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> and other cartoon characters. But after riding <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Pirates of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>,'' the couple warmed to the occasion, showing an impromptu interest in other attractions. `` They both had been here before, but her majesty remembered what she called the ghost house and she wanted to see that again,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>. So the couple took an unexpected tour through `` The Haunted Mansion,'' which <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said is not really scary. `` They're the kind of ghosts you want to take home with you,'' she said. The king was drawn to <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Star Tours,'' which simulates an imaginary ride through a universe designed by filmmaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>. `` They both were laughing it, and they enjoyed it very much,'' Ms. <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. The tour started with a parade down Main Street during which the king and queen rode in a black-enameled, horse-drawn carriage. Neither of them spoke to the crowds or to reporters during the visit. The couple arrived in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Monday for the last leg of their 17-day, 15-city <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour celebrating the 350th anniversary of Swedish immigration to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 The prosecutor and the defense attorney in <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s attempted murder trial agree that the subway gunman received an illegal sentence and should be given a new one. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Waples </PERSON>, assistant district attorney, asked the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s Appellate Division on Wednesday to send the case back to Justice <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> for resentencing. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, a 41-year-old self-employed electronics technician, was sentenced Oct. 19 to six months in jail plus 4 -LCB- years' probation for his conviction last year of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon. The weapon was a .38 - caliber revolver he used to shoot four teen-agers on a subway on Dec. 22, <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> said he shot the black teen-agers because they were trying to rob him, but they maintained they they were panhandling money. Three of the victims recovered from their wounds. The fourth was paralyzed from the waist down and suffered brain damage. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> asked the Apellate Division to vacate the sentence and instead give him a year in jail because a quirk in the law would make him eligible for release in 60 days, whereas he would have to serve at least four months of the six-month sentence imposed by <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>. <PERSON> Waples </PERSON> said: `` We agree with the defendant that this split sentence was illegal and must be vacated. We also agree that this case should be remanded for imposition of a statutorily authorized sentence.'' He said that by law, the court must impose a definitive sentence of one year or an indeterminate sentence with a specific minimum and maximum term. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> delivered a keynote speech Sunday at the annual luncheon of the Federation of Rifle and Pistol Clubs, at which he said <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> `` should have sentenced me to a testimonial dinner and a tickertape parade,'' according to <PERSON> Waples </PERSON>' court papers. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> said the six-month sentence was an abuse of the judge's discretion and would have an adverse impact on his emotional health <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> is out on bail pending appeal.

 A protest strike virtually shut down Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and cities in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today despite Israeli claims that the 5-month-old Palestinian uprising was on the wane. Following two infiltrations by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> guerrillas, Prime Minister Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on Wednesday that guerrillas were trying to mount a spectacular attack on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because the uprising was `` petering out.'' Today, however, east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> streets were deserted in response to a strike call by uprising leaders. Even fruit and vegetable vendors, normally active during strikes, had closed. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, young Palestinians whose faces were masked with checkered Arab scarves stopped cars to ensure workers did not go to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports. Wrecked cars and huge rocks blocked roadways in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> and oil was spread on some streets to discourage drivers. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s Manger Square, normally busy with traffic and vendors, was nearly empty. An Arab reporter noted that even bakeries were shut in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, senior aides of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Wednesday said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman traveled to the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital to meet with his commanders `` to discuss ways of escalating the Palestinian uprising.'' Only scattered clashes were reported in recent days in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where 174 Arabs and two Israelis have been killed since anti-Israeli protests began Dec. 8. Protesters and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers clashed twice on Wednesday evening after Moslems ended the sunrise-to-sunset fast that is kept daily during the holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, according to reports. Jewish settlers and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> stood on roofs and shouted `` Slaughter the Jews!'' in a disturbance that lasted late into the night. Soldiers used tear gas to disperse the protesters. No injuries were reported. The incident began when youths stoned a group of Jewish women walking through downtown <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> at 11 p.m., said <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON>, who was in the group. `` We were a group of about 15 women on a stroll when <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> began throwing stones at us,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON> said. `` The army came immediately and fired tear gas at the Arabs who disappeared into an alley.'' Earlier, the army said, Arabs in the Dheishe refugee camp near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> stoned troops who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. A military spokeswoman said seven Palestinians were taken to the hospital, treated and released. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said some suffered rubber bullet wounds and others fractures from beatings. An army report on Wednesday concluded that a 15-year-old female Jewish settler whose death in the occupied lands raised a furor was killed by a bullet from a careless Israeli guard, not by stones thrown by Palestinians. But the report also blamed Arabs from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> for causing the April 6 confrontation with a group of Israeli hikers, during which two Palestinians also died. Both guerrilla infiltrations this week were near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dov </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northeastern border. In Tuesday's clash, three guerrillas and two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were killed in a fierce gun battle The two guerrillas killed on Wednesday planned to take hostages to exchange them for Arab prisoners held in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, using <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> as a negotiator, said a military source, citing documents found on their bodies. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. Truck driver <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahan </PERSON>, 24, said the guerrillas fired at him and threw a grenade. `` I jumped from the truck and it started to roll down and I hid behind it. They fired at me while I crawled on the ground,'' <PERSON> Dahan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dahan </PERSON> ran about 1 -LCB- miles before reaching an army post, a soldier identified only as Sgt. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV. Hundreds of soldiers combed the rocky terrain, while two helicopter gunships blanketed the ground with fire to prevent the guerrillas from reaching nearby settlements, said the military source. Three hours later, troops spotted the guerrillas in a ravine. `` We fired, and they did n't have much choice but to die,'' 1st Lt. <PERSON> Menny </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV. The military source said the guerrillas were members of the pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, who was blamed for the 1985 hijacking of the <ORGANIZATION> Achille </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lauro </ORGANIZATION> cruise ship in which an American was killed. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> both claimed responsibility.

 A woman who ran a red light was shot to death 12 minutes later by police who mistakenly believed she had fired at them during a chaotic chase through <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lydia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, died in her car about 2 a.m. Wednesday surrounded by 18 to 20 officers. Five officers fired 13 times, wounding her three times. She was dead on arrival at a hospital, police said. Assistant police chief <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Selvaggi </PERSON> said no weapon was found in her car. He said as many as 20 police officers answered a report of shots fired at police, but the shots were from Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who tried to shoot out her tires after she refused to stop her car. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was suspended without pay for `` failing to be forthright in interviews'' with investigators after the shooting, <PERSON> Selvaggi </PERSON> said. Police later said he made `` a false statement regarding the firing of three shots.'' <PERSON> Selvaggi </PERSON> said <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s use of the gun to try to stop the car appeared to violate police procedure, which calls for a weapon to be fired only when officers are endangered by a suspect. The incident began at 1:40 a.m. when Mrs. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> ran a red light and refused to stop for patrol car officers who used a siren, flashing lights and loudspeakers, he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, a former drug addict enrolled in a methadone program, slowly moved erratically up and down streets until, at one point, she ran up on a curb and stopped, he said. An officer tried to open her door but she sped off, nearly pinning him against a wall, said police spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. After her car rolled over the sidewalk for about 60 feet and came off the curb, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> fired three shots at her tires. Other officers radioed that shots had been fired and called for backup, <PERSON> Selvaggi </PERSON> said. He said some officers might have been under the false impression that the shots were fired at the police officers and caused the transmission of a message that overdramatized the danger of the situation. As other radio cars began responding, Mrs. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> suddenly turned her car around and police converged on the scene, he said. One officer tried to pull her from the car but lost his grip and she lunged toward the passenger side, police said. `` Somebody said three times, ` Watch out! She's reaching for it,''' <PERSON> Selvaggi </PERSON> said. A police sergeant and four officers opened fire, hitting her in the cheek, the left side of her body, and her skull. She was dead on arrival at <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. No disciplinary action was taken against the officers who opened fire, although they will be assigned to desk duties while the investigation continues. The entire episode, from the time she ran the red light to the time she was shot, took about 12 minutes, police said.

<HEAD>Plastic Cartoon Wristwatches Are Hot Items at Warhol Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s plastic wristwatches of <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Flintstone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jetson </PERSON> and Gumby reached $ 2,640 in a `` wild'' bidding war _ $ 2,590 more than the timepieces cost the late artist in a department store, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s said. Kitschy collectibles were only some of the objects on sale Wednesday during the fifth day of the 10-day auction of <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s possessions There was also serious jewelry on the block. American Indian art, including `` no end of turquoise jewelry'' was to be sold at today's auction, said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. So far, <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s collection has fetched $ 9,072,000, more than twice <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s high estimate of $ 3,951,000. Only 37 out of some 1,400 lots have not sold, she said. The highest bid Wednesday was $ 55,000 for a pair of surrealist ear clips by artist <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>, according to Ms. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. The buyer, a private collector, was not identified. The ear clips, asymmetrical ruby-studded hearts with a honeycomb center set with round diamonds, had a pre-sale estimated value of $ 10,000 to $ 15,000. An 18-karat gold, garnet and diamond circular pendant, also by <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>, brought $ 47,300, Ms. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. The pendant, estimated at $ 7,500 to $ 10,000, depicted the profiles of Tristan and <PERSON> Isolde </PERSON> separated by a chalice. The brightly-colored cartoon watches, made by <PERSON> Lewco </PERSON>, were decorated with raised, full-length figures of <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dino </PERSON>, his pet dinosaur; <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jetson </PERSON> standing with hands on hips; and a smiling Gumby. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> bought them in 1985 and 1986 at <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, Ms. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. In their original plastic packaging, the watches bore the original price tags of $ 20 and $ 10, she said. `` People were so wild to have the three plastic watches in the sale. They sort of symbolize the sale of the whole collection _ something people will remember,'' she said. The pre-sale estimate was $ 60 to $ 80 for all three. But in `` wild bidding'' that came down to a telephone contest between four people, the price climbed to $ 2,640, Ms. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. A private collector, who was not identified, won the bidding. <PERSON> Bloomingdale </PERSON>'s still sells the watches in some stores, said <PERSON> Miraed </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a store spokeswoman. Another wristwatch that did well at the auction was a stainless steel piece, dated 1948, with a photo image of <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Autry </PERSON> and signed `` always your pal <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Autry </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s estimated it would sell for $ 50 to $ 100 but it went for $ 1,870, Ms. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. Proceeds from the auction will benefit the <ORGANIZATION> Andy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warhol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, which will award grants to cultural institutions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> died at age 58 last year.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> today said a wide-ranging trade bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would hurt world economic growth, and they urged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto the measure. A top <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> official, however, today said the British colony `` can live with'' the bill because some punitive provisions in the original version were removed or watered down in the final version. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> also noted that the bill was less protectionist than other versions but added that it still requires the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to retaliate against countries that violate bilateral trade pacts. `` It leaves no room for negotiation,'' said a statement from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s Board of Foreign Trade. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> said its trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> totaled a record $ 16 billion last year. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> placed the figure at $ 19 billion. The bill, which was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and passed in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on April 21, now goes to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who has said he will veto it. The measure toughens <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation against countries engaged in unfair trade. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> strongly fears that if the bill is enacted in its present form, it will have a serious impact on bilateral and multilateral economic cooperation and may hinder the development of the world economy,'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s chief government spokesman, <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>, said today. The bill imposes trade sanctions against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for its subsidiary's sale of sensitive equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The sales violated rules of the <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, a Paris-based group that regulates Western high-technology exports to communist nations. <PERSON> Joichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoi </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION>, which stands to lose more than $ 50 million this year if the bill becomes law, also expressed strong disappointment. `` <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was neither involved in, nor had any knowledge of, the misconduct by <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Aoi </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Thus, we have been insisting that it would be grossly unfair to punish <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'' <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>'s statement said the bill's passage was `` extremely regrettable.'' It added: `` The government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> strongly hopes that such a bill will not finally be enacted.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says its overall trade deficit for 1987 was a record $ 171.2 billion, up from $ 156.2 billion in 1986. The largest bilateral deficit was with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a record $ 59.8 billion, up from $ 58.6 billion in 1986. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it hoped `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration ... will take appropriate actions in line with its much publicized stand on the bill.'' The statement by ministry spokesman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwang-kyung </PERSON> said the bill contained provisions that `` might undermine an orderly growth of international trade.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> also warned that the bill `` will hamper not only the liberalization efforts of the -LRB- South Korean -RRB- government but also the smooth growing of the Korea-U.S. economic and trade relationship.'' He said <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> fully understands the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' trade deficit problems and has been making serious efforts to open its own market. The bill would affect current international trade negotiations and `` lead the world economy to a probable down-turn,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> added. Little progress has been reported in recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiations with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> access to South Korean markets. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ran a trade deficit of nearly $ 10 billion with <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1987. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, Director of Trade <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sze </PERSON> said the trade bill is `` a much better bill than the original one and many of the provisions which we were concerned about have either been improved or dropped completely. `` So from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s perspective I think it's a bill that we can live with,'' <PERSON> Sze </PERSON> told government-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ran up a $ 6.5 billion deficit on $ 14.5 billion in trade with <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> last year. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have praised <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s duty-free policies they want the colony to raise the value of its currency to make <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> products more expensive and less competitive in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell in thin trading on European markets this morning. Gold prices were steady in stagnant trading. The dollar began falling late Wednesday after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Federal Reserve Governor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> warned of a growing risk of inflation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as many industries reach capacity limits, dealers said. `` The market has been bearish on the dollar all along, and the <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> comment was for many just the trigger to sell,'' one <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> trader said. Dealers were divided on what the effect on the market would be of an agreement by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC producers now meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to limit oil production. `` The dollar would fall if a strong deal emerges from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a major oil importer,'' said a trader in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. But another trader said the presence of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Railroad Commissioner <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting indicated that an agreement to cut oil production would n't be completely negative for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy.

But he also told reporters that his party would be `` sincere and humble in our attitude to any kind of negotiations with the government if it allows a healthy and constructive climate to arise.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said he did not expect any political instability here before the 1988 Olympics open in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Sept. 17. He indicated his party would be willing to defer some issues until after the Olympics. He also said his party would seek common ground with the two other main opposition parties in pressing for greater democracy, the release of political detainees and the revision of `` immoral laws.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> mentioned the National Security Act, under which some dissidents have been accused of favoring communism. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said they would consider a proposal by former Prime Minister <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-pil </PERSON>, leader of the third opposition party, to coordinate activities. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-pil </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 35 seats in Tuesday's elections. Those seats could give a majority in the 299-seat assembly to either the government party or the combined main opposition parties. The government party has 125 seats, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jong </PERSON>'s party 71 and the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> has 59. The elections gave a sharp boost to <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, 62, a 1971 presidential candidate who spent long periods in prison or under house arrest and then was seen as a fading figure after finishing third in presidential balloting last December. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> won in December with 36.6 percent of the vote after <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> both insisted on running and split the opposition vote. Six months earlier, as governing party chairman, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> had announced democratic reforms following massive anti-government protests. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> told a news conference that despite pledges of greater democracy, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s administration had delayed in registering new newspapers until after Tuesday's election, did not release all political detainees, and seemed to be reneging on promises to allow the election of mayors and provincial governors. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> also reiterated charges of massive government fraud in presidential and parliamentary balloting, but said voters had not been swayed by government power and money this time. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said more than 1,000 political detainees remained in custody and without their release, `` I don ` t believe there will ever be political stability in this country.'' He said his party never has demanded the release of communists. He said he had not studied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suggestions that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> pay more of the cost of stationing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops here under a defense treaty, but said it has been `` a great political gamble for me'' to defend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supported the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government for `` selfish interests,'' and had interfered in Korean politics by describing the December elections as fair and by saying in an official report that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> no longer had a human rights question. `` This is an imprudent and inconsiderate position,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Police: Students Burglarize Cars with Tools Made in Shop Class</HEAD>

 Police and school officials ca n't explain what triggered a three-month spree of car thefts now linked to 10 teen-agers who are accused of using tools made in a high school shop class. `` Normally, you do n't find that kind of operation in a small town like ours,'' <ORGANIZATION> Metamora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said most of the 2,500 residents of <LOCATION> Metamora </LOCATION>, about 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, were stunned by the allegations against the teens, who were arrested Tuesday at rural <ORGANIZATION> Metamora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're surprised at the number of kids involved and the amount of property taken,'' he said. The students face felony charges that include vehicle burglary and conspiracy to commit vehicle burglary, police said. Their names were withheld because the two girls and eight boys _ who have no previous police records _ are juveniles, ranging in age from 15 to 17. Two of the youths face 27 counts each of burglary and conspiracy. The group has been linked to 33 burglaries in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> and 14 in <LOCATION> Tazewell </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Woodford </LOCATION> counties. In addition, police said the group is responsible for a residential theft in <LOCATION> Tazewell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Police estimated the value of the three-month crime spree exceeds $ 10,000. `` Two individuals were making tools for their friends to gain entry to vehicles,'' <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> Police Capt. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Burwell </PERSON> said Wednesday. The tools resembled the `` slim-jims'' used by police to enter locked cars, <PERSON> Burwell </PERSON> said. The devices were used in most of the burglaries, although some vehicles were entered using coat hangers or by simply breaking windows, he said. The thieves usually took money, radar detectors and stereo equipment, and some items later were sold to friends and relatives. <PERSON> Burwell </PERSON> said the investigation by local police was still active. `` They went out at night and on weekends, driving around and looking for something good,'' he said. `` It appears two of them made the tools in shop class. But there is no link to anyone else at the school,'' <PERSON> Burwell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Metamora </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stromberger </PERSON> was concerned mostly with the ties to his school's shop class. He cited a lack of parental guidance for the arrests and said the school's role in the incident was minimal. `` We do n't have a course on burglary tools,'' <PERSON> Stromberger </PERSON> said.

 Soviet-backed Afghan troops shelled border areas and killed about 15 Pakistanis, officials in northwest <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said today. Also today, the leader of the Afghan guerrilla alliance met with ambassadors of three European countries to seek recongnition of an interim Afghan government being formed by the insurgents. Officials in the Khyber region of northwest <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said about 15 people died and more than a dozen were injured when Afghan shells slammed into the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> side of the <LOCATION> Torkham </LOCATION> border post late Wednesday. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity. It was the third straight day of cross-border bombardments as fighting between <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> communist troops and the guerrillas intensified in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Reports reaching the Pakistani capital said the border post remained closed to all traffic for the past two days because of the shelling and increased fighting on the road to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Guerrilla leaders based in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, had warned of a new surge of attacks in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to coincide with the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government's April 26 and 27 celebration of the 10th anniversary of the military coup that brought Marxists to power. Western observers said the guerrilla offensive also appears aimed at boosting their control of the eastern region in preparation for the withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> scheduled to begin May 15. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed an accord April 14 in which <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> pledged to stop serving as a pipeline for military aid to the guerrillas and the Soviets agreed to withdraw an estimated 115,000 troops. Guerrilla leaders refuse to discuss their arms supplies, but it is believed they are planning to move their stockpiles of mainly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> side of the border to the Afghan side. Reports from the remote tribal agencies along the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> frontier indicate as many as 40 Pakistanis and Afghans have been killed in retaliatory shellings by communist forces since the guerrilla push started more than a week ago. <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, chairman of the seven-party alliance, met with the ambassadors of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> to discuss recognition by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> of a guerrilla-led government. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> has said the administration would begin operating soon at an undisclosed location near <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. According to a statement from the alliance headquarters, German Ambassador <PERSON> Gerd </PERSON> <PERSON> Berendonck </PERSON> promised that no <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> money earmarked for reconstruction would go to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, but that recognition of the insurgents would have to come from the respective <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> governments. The insurgents control much of the Afghan countryside, with Soviet-Afghan forces holding <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the major cities.

 Goldie, a 23-pound albino trout that drew tourists to a federal fish hatchery in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, has been found dead after a four month fishnapping investigation, federal officials said. Two men who told federal agents they used a net to lift the huge trout out of a visitor display pond will face charges in federal court in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, officials said. Goldie's disappearance around Christmas last year from the National Fish Hatchery in <LOCATION> Ennis </LOCATION> prompted a multi-state search and an offer of a $ 2,500 reward for the safe return of the fish.

 Immigration Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said today xtending the May 4 deadline for illegal aliens to apply for amnesty `` would send a very bad signal to people below the border.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is considering a measure passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that would extend the deadline to Nov. 30. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, stopped attempts to bring the issue to a vote Wednesday. `` Extending it would send a very bad signal to people below the border,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning.'' He said the long lines of aliens applying as the deadline nears are the result of people leaving it until the last minute, not because of a flaw in the program. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> estimated between 1.7 million and 1.8 million people would apply under the program before the deadline, with the number gaining legal status swelling to 3 million as eligible relatives are allowed to enter the country. An immigration rights advocate, <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalke </PERSON>, accused the commission of failing in its efforts to inform immigrants about the program. `` There's a lot of confusion, a lot of fear,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Kalke </PERSON>, also interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> or another senator continues today to block the vote, the soonest the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could move to cut off debate would be Friday. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said there has been `` a mammoth increase in the number of people entering the country illegally'' in the past year because word spread that a tough new immigration law would not be enforced. `` If we came in now and changed the law on the very eve of it going into effect, the net result would be to cast further doubt on the credibility of the law and that would bring numerous people across the border illegally,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. `` We extended the deadline for taxes, why not amnesty?'' asked Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` The May 4 deadline has turned out to be too short and too harsh. A refusal to extend it is cruel and vindictive.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the extension 213-201 last week, a majority much too small to override a threatened presidential veto. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the landmark immigration law in November 1986 and no changes have been made since then. The law carefully balanced a legalization program for illegal aliens with penalties for employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers. Under the law, aliens who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally but have lived here continuously since before Jan. 1, 1982, were given one year to apply for temporary residency as the first step toward permanent status. That 12-month deadline is May 4. Those who favor the extension of that deadline argue the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reacted too slowly at the beginning of the amnesty period and did not spread the word to the immigrant communities to apply for temporary residency. In addition, many illegal aliens were thought to fear appearing at an office of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that also deports those here illegally. The law specifically prohibits the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> amnesty employees from sharing their records with enforcement agents. During House debate, the chief sponsor of the extension, Rep. <PERSON> romano </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON>, D-Ky., said 1.2 million aliens have applied for the general amnesty program, and 729,000 have received temporary residency cards Another 400,000 have applied for a spearate agricultural amnesty program that is not affected by the extension legislation.

<TEXT>
 More than a dozen people have offered to adopt a toddler who was found wandering in traffic a month ago, but state officials are continuing their search for his relatives. Despite a flood of calls to state social workers since a judge allowed the 18-month-old boy's picture to be published last week, investigators say they still have few hard leads. `` It is so sad,'' said <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>, a child abuse and neglect investigator with the state's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is n't something that happens every day.'' `` If there were relatives out there, they would have called,'' she said. `` Either someone knows this boy and is not coming forward or he is not from this area.'' The only clue authorities have is a confusing account by a man who says he's `` Little <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s'' uncle and that the boy's father left a Skid Row bar last month bound for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state on a borrowed motorcycle. `` He does n't seem to know very much about the boy,'' <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> police detective <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We want to find the father so we can verify this is not some boy who was kidnapped somewhere else in the country.'' HRS officials have listed the toddler with `` Child Find'' in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> and the national registry for missing children, in case the child was abducted in another part of the country and parents are searching for him. The toddler has been in protective custody since March 25 when he was rescued from traffic. The next day, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> `` Smokey'' <PERSON> Kwil </PERSON> reported his 18-month-old nephew missing from the same area. <PERSON> Kwil </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> police he first saw the boy on March 23 in a bar. The child was with <PERSON> Kwil </PERSON>'s half-brother, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, he told police. During the night <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> borrowed a motorcycle and left, <PERSON> Kwil </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kwil </PERSON> has told differing stories about what happened to the boy, but <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said it appeared the child wandered away from <PERSON> Kwil </PERSON>'s trailer not far from where he was found in traffic A misdemeanor child abuse charge has been filed against <PERSON> Kwil </PERSON>. If responsible relatives are not located, the courts could put the boy for adoption in about six months. Ms. <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> said more than a dozen people had already called by Wednesday offering to adopt the little boy.

 Government warplanes bombed a food relief station in drought-stricken northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and killed at least 50 people after the area fell into rebel hands, two Western sources said. But the sources disputed a claim by the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> that the government used naplam in the April 8 attack near <LOCATION> Wukro </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> province The guerrilla group said 31 people, mostly children, were killed or wounded in the bombing, which hit a kindergarten. But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday night, said at least 50 people were killed and many more wounded in the attack, which occurred at a food distribution center run by the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> representative was at <LOCATION> Wukro </LOCATION> the day of the attack, but left before the attack, the sources said. They said the warplanes stuck about 30 minutes after monthly food allotments had been distributed to 5,000 to 8,000 peasants, and that thousands of drought victims were milling about. `` That's why so many people were killed,'' said one of the sources, who quoted eyewitnesses who said the attack on the civilians was intentional. `` They flew over and looked at them and came back and hit them,'' said the source. Neither of the sources could say how many bombs were dropped or what type of aircraft were used in the attack. The Ethiopian military normally uses Soviet-made MiG figthers. <PERSON> Wukro </PERSON> came under rebel control in mid-March. During the same time, rebels operating in neighboring <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s northernmost province, also scored major victories Government troops retreated to the major towns in the two provinces, but officials have said a major campaign is planned soon against the rebel movements. The government pullback and the April 6 expulsion of foreign aid workers from the north has severely crippled the effort to save more than 3 million northern Ethiopians from starvation. The government said it ordered foreigners out of the north to keep them from getting caught in the middle of the fighting. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting the central government in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> for 14 years in a campaign to win more rights for the region.

 <PERSON> Olaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieghorst </PERSON>, one of the nation's most prominent Western artists whose work was once displayed in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, has died. He was 88. <PERSON> Weighorst </PERSON> died Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Grossmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> from respiratory complications that could have stemmed from an old horseback riding injury, according to his wife. The Danish immigrant, who would have been 89 on Saturday, gained worldwide fame for his works. Many of his 3,000 paintings and sculptures are on display at museums throughout the country. In 1985, two of his pieces _ `` The <PERSON> Navajo </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'' and `` Navajo Man'' _ were sold for $ 1 million. The price was also the highest fetched for Western art. `` The <PERSON> Navajo </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>,'' which depicts an Indian woman on horseback holding her baby, had sold three years earlier for $ 450,000, then a record price for Western art. <PERSON> Wieghorst </PERSON>'s work has been in the collections of three presidents _ <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ and a host of other prominent Americans, including actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> put a <ORGANIZATION> Wieghorst </ORGANIZATION> painting on a wall of the Oval Office during his eight years in office. `` My greatest teacher has been the horse,'' <PERSON> Wieghorst </PERSON> said in a 1982 interview. `` I could n't have learned what I did from some teacher in art school ... I learned by doing; I paint what I know.'' The son of a Danish photographer, <PERSON> Wieghorst </PERSON> signed on as a seaman on a <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> merchant ship when he was 18. When the vessel arrived at <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, in 1919, he jumped ship, later joining the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> cavalry and gaining his American citizenship. Following his discharge, <PERSON> Wieghorst </PERSON> worked as a cowboy for three years in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and began sketching horses. He then became a mounted police officer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he often patrolled Central Park. He sketched during his free time and started selling his works. He retired from the police force in 1944 and moved with his family to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION>, about 15 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, to take up painting full time. His survivors include his wife, <PERSON> Mae </PERSON>, and a son, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieghorst </PERSON>.

 Federal drug investigators have teamed with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> officials to find out how $ 1 million worth of cocaine got to National Airport hidden in the toilet holding tanks of a jet from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Drug Enforcement Administration special agent <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said it is not the first time drugs have been hidden in the toilets of planes, but it is unlikely that a normal passenger could have done it. The plane, Eastern Flight 806, originated in <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, and landed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for unloading and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs inspection before going on to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where the drugs were discovered early Wednesday. It's final destination was to be <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` So far we do n't know where the drugs either originated or were to be picked up,'' said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> special agent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, but he concurred with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> that it appeared to be an inside job. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said the airline was cooperating fully with investigators, but it was too soon to speculate how or where the drugs got on board. She said there have been arrests of Eastern personnel on drug smuggling charges in the past, but not recently. The cocaine was discovered by a maintenance crew searching for the source of a leak in a toilet in the forward portion of the plane. Five packages of 85 percent pure cocaine the size of bricks and wrapped in plastic were found in the tank. A drug-sniffing dog brought in by <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents and airport police found another five packages in the rear toilet holding tanks. Officials said the 10 kilograms of cocaine had a street value of more than $ 1 million. `` In this area, it was one of the larger amounts that has been seized,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. He said the plane would have been checked in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials who normally board all aircraft coming into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and search for evidence of drug smuggling. `` I do n't know if they use canines, though,'' he said. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said Eastern security personnel also participate in searches of planes from out of the country, but she would not specify whether drug-sniffing dogs are used. `` We believe the persons -LRB- who were to receive it -RRB- knew that it was there and were to go to the aircraft when it was serviced,'' said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. No arrests were made immediately. `` This could have been a major drug supply route and the shipments could have gone on for awhile,'' said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>. `` We just do n't know how long it's been going on.''

<HEAD>Homosexuals Pessimistic About Church Granting Recognition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Homosexuals seeking full recognition by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> praised a statement by the denomination's bishops `` calling AIDS a disease, not a sin,'' but say they expect no further advances from the church's quadrennial meeting here `` The delegates to the General Conference will use the language of faith when they talk about our living and our loving, but the odor in the air will be that of fear,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>, a spokesman for Affirmation: <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian-Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday at a news conference. The Methodists' 100-member Council of Bishops, in a statement issued last week, declared that AIDS was `` a disease, not a sin'' and that God does not wage `` germ warfare on the human family.'' But the council also repeated the church's official disapproval of sex outside of heterosexual marriage and continued to deny leadership roles to homosexuals in the church. Nearly 1,000 delegates are attending the two-week General Conference that began Monday and runs through May 6. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, with 9.6 million members, is the second-largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It also has members in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Language in church law that calls homosexuality `` incompatible with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> teaching'' and says that `` self-avowed practicing homosexuals are not to be accepted as candidates, ordained as ministers or appointed to serve in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'' is scheduled to be debated Monday. Affirmation has 31 chapters nationwide, and 32 Methodist congregations have affirmed their openness to full participation by homosexuals, spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaddis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gaddis </PERSON>, a lesbian, said she did not expect the church to grant equal status to homosexuals during the conference. `` The chances are zero in the next 10 days,'' she said. `` In 10 years _ that's a possibility.'' `` Most Methodists, like most other people, think they do n't know anyone who is lesbian, gay or bisexual,'' said <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>. `` The only information they have about us is based on myth and stereotype, with little more connection to reality than the racism-inspired image of ` little black Sambo' bears to black Americans.'' Church leaders have responded to such charges by saying that they are on record as insisting `` that all persons are entitled to have their human and civil rights ensured.'' The church's Book of Discipline, published in 1984, goes on to say, `` Homosexual persons no less than heterosexual persons are individuals of sacred worth who need the ministry and guidance of the church in their struggles for human fulfillment, as well as the spiritual and emotional care of a fellowship.'' The move to delete the restrictive language from church doctrine has been opposed by several conservative groups, including Good News, an unofficial caucus that represents itself as the center of `` Scriptural Christianity'' in the denomination. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> was put on involuntary leave of absence for several years by Bishop <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> acknowledged that he was homosexual. In 1984 <PERSON> Tuell </PERSON> agreed to appoint <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> to his current job as executive director of a mental health center in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> serving lesbians and gay men.

 Diligent coverage by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> journalists in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is crucial to combat a misinformation campaign engineered by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his crackdown on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s opposition press, said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The enemies of democracy are acutely aware that if they are to succeed in their designs of world domination, freedom of the press must be fought,'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bautista </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said in a luncheon address to the 102nd annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> here Wednesday. `` As we have seen in the case of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, freedom of the press has become not only the biggest obstacle to the totalitarian regime but also its most formidable foe.'' Earlier Wednesday, the publishers heard from Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>; the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and various local experts on the <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> region. The <ORGANIZATION> ANPA </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 1,400 newspapers, also conducted its annual business meeting, which included formally electing officers and directors to its 22-member board. The three-day convention attracted more than 2,000 people representing 90 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> daily newspaper circulation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should communicate with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but `` can not negotiate the future of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said after the speech. Representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are `` conversing with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but they're not negotiating with him. While the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> definitely has legitimate concerns in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, what we're facing is basically a Panamanian problem and requires a Panamanian solution,'' he said. With <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy in shreds and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> still in power three months after being indicted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug charges, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has been forced to rethink its strict conditions for his ouster. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy assistant for legal affairs, held secret meetings with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> recently. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> was expected to meet again with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> next week. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions alone would not topple <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> at this time would be too drastic, <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is defeated for all practical purposes,'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said, `` and a move by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military might give him ammunition,'' by fueling his claims that he is a national hero defending his country against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> remains loyal to President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was ousted by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> two months ago. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said that greater freedom of information in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has given Soviet citizens not only a better view of the world, but an improved sense of history. `` We have a real information explosion in our country now,'' he said. Soviet journalists are now allowed to write about issues affecting their country such as prostitution and drug abuse, and literary magazines that publish works by formerly dissident authors have seen huge gains in circulation, he said. `` We write about -LRB- Soviet -RRB- history, where we have a very many dark pages,'' he said. The climate for foreign journalists also has improved, with the number of foreign correspondents almost doubling during the past five years, he said. There are 51 American journalists in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, compared with 35 Soviet correspondents in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, head of information for the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, who sometimes uses his dry wit to chide Americans, made a reference to former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' admission in a book that he falsely attributed quotes to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` As I understand it, I will be standing right there at -LRB- White House spokesman -RRB- <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s side'' to keep track of what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says at the upcoming <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` I am sorry for <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, because he can not make from the book the money he lost from <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>,'' where he was forced to resign from a public relations job, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. His speech was followed by a military briefing by Adm. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>. With <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> still present, the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and two aides outlined an increasing Soviet military presence in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military capabilities there. In the first talk in a general session devoted to the topic of `` <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in the Year 2000,'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hao </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here, said that by the next century, East and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> will produce about 20 percent of the `` gross world product.'' As recently as 1960, he said, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> produced 36 percent with East and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> contributing only 11 percent. `` We must significantly alter our world outlook and adjust our national orientation to take into account the political, economic and cultural forces of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 Community leaders, hoping to bury the violence that has killed scores of people in their neighborhoods, carried a powder-blue coffin to City Hall in a symbolic protest against gang-style bloodshed. The motorcade staged Wednesday by community religious leaders and the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> comprised 25 vehicles, including five hearses and two ambulances. The cars wound their way through the city's south side to City Hall. Pallbearers carried the casket up the City Hall steps, and local leaders addressed the rally. The procession, with police escort, stopped in front of two gang-infested high schools, where participants got out of the cars to chant, `` Up with hope, down with dope.'' At one south side intersection, in the heart of a neighborhood notorious for its gang activity, police arrested two men who came out of their home, apparently coincidentally, armed with a shotgun. The motorcade also featured a simulated drive-by shooting patterned after the method favored by gang members. `` We conducted a drive-by _ but we did not use bullets of lead, we used bullets of faith and bullets of prayer,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. Last year, 387 people died in gang-related violence in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. So far this year, more than 80 people have been killed by gang violence. Also Wednesday, in an incident that police said was n't gang-related, two elderly women sitting at a bus stop in an affluent neighborhood near <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> were shot with a pellet gun by laughing assailants in a passing car One woman was hit in the wrist, the other in the leg, but neither was wounded seriously by the apparently random attack, hospital officials said.

 It was fairy-tale night for real at the Royal Ballet when the leading ballerina in `` Swan Lake'' was hurt during her performance, danced on in pain, then had to be replaced by a dancer who did n't know the role. `` Oh, I loved it _ they were shouting at me from the wings and miming what I had to do, but I could n't dance and watch them as well so I just danced,'' the substitute, 20-year-old <PERSON> Viviana </PERSON> <PERSON> Durante </PERSON>, said after a sensational performance Wednesday night. `` It was a bit of a surprise to find a different ballerina in my arms in the middle of the third act,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolley </PERSON> of <PERSON> Payson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, who was dancing the lead male role of Prince <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> in the classical Russian ballet set to music by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilich </PERSON> <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>. `` Let's just say the fourth act was very vocal _ there was more talking than dancing going on, but <PERSON> Viviana </PERSON> was very cool, very together,'' he added. There were gasps from those in the audience who could see it when the crisis began at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON>, in the dual role of Odette-Odile, danced tip-toe into the scenery on her left as she was going offstage after being transformed back into a swan at the end of the second act. She fell against a sharp-edged step and crashed to the floor, but rose quickly and appeared to be unhurt as she disappeared into the wings. Miss <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON> began the third act but was replaced by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Durante </PERSON>, who stepped into the role just as she had to do the famous 32 fouette turns _ a grueling series in which the dancer spins on one leg while whipping the other around her body. Miss Durante received bravos and it was clear at that point that not everyone realizedthere had been a substitution. The management then told all. Before the curtain went up for the fourth act, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowell </PERSON>, the company's artistic director, told the audience that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON> had been dancing in severe pain and was unable to complete the third act. `` There was no understudy in the house and we have been ringing all the ballerinas in town who know the role. But this is one of those nights when only their answering machines are answering,'' he said. There were cheers when <PERSON> Dowell </PERSON> announced that Italian-born <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Durante </PERSON>, who had danced as a peasant girl in the first act and as a cygnet in the second, had frantically tried to learn the leading role `` in about five minutes.'' `` It has been one of those all-too-real Broadway show-business nights,'' <PERSON> Dowell </PERSON> said. The audience thought it was terrific stuff and cheered. Miss <PERSON> Durante </PERSON> received a standing ovation at the end and was showered with the daffodils and narcissi that fans had brought for Miss Almeida. The Angola-born Miss <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON>, 24, is widely admired. She was promoted from soloist to principal dancer in September after six years with the Royal Ballet. <PERSON> Dowell </PERSON> said the extent of her injuries would not be known until after an X-ray today: `` I just do n't know how she danced so well in such pain ... And then to have someone else jump up and save the day _ that's theater.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> vowed today that anti-communist rebels would never take over the Afghan government and that Soviet military advisers would remain in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> indefinitely. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said negotiations with U.S.-backed rebel forces in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> were continuing, but he said the alliance of seven rebel groups has taken an `` illogical, rigid stand'' in negotiations on a coalition government. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who spoke at a news conference for foreign journalists, said the Afghan government was confident it could stave off the insurgents after Soviet troops withdraw if `` outside interference'' ceases, a reference to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the rebels. `` The military cooperation of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> began 23 years prior to the April revolution,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said, referring to the Soviet-inspired coup 10 years ago that installed a Marxist government. He said Soviet military assistance would not stop after the pullout of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> troops, scheduled to begin on May 15 according to an accord signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> this month. `` It is not our position to stop cooperating with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, especially when the situation is not settled yet,'' he said. He declined to say how many Soviet military advisers would remain here after the withdrawal, and he said assistance from other friendly nations in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> also was expected. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, responding to a question, also said he would not consider leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> if the rebel forces take over. `` We shall not allow such a thing, that the coalition government come under the influence of these forces hostile to the policy of national reconciliation proclaimed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he said. National reconciliation is <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s proposal for drawing in rebel leaders with his <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in hopes of ending the civil war. Pakistan-based rebel groups have rejected the offers and vowed to continue their fight to oust the Moscow-backed government. In an apparent bid to put together a leadership acceptable to the Afghan people when Soviet troops leave, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said he offfered a role in the new government to former King <PERSON> Zahr </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>. He said the monarch, now living in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, has a responsibility to help his nation. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who has been head of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s government since May 1986, did not specify what position the king could fill if he returned to <LOCATION> afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> also confirmed his predecessor, <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON>, is in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where he is under medical care. The estimated 115,000 Soviet troops now in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to bolster <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s army are expected to complete the withdrawal by the end of the year. Soviet soldiers first entered the war in December 1979.

 A fire described as the city's biggest since World War II swept through a crowded shantytown near an oil storage area today and destroyed more than 1,000 homes, the fire chief said At least four people were reported injured in the blaze, which spread thick black smoke over large sections of the capital. No deaths were reported. The government-run <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said an estimated 3,000 families were left homeless. Firefighters concentrated on preventing the flames from reaching the oil tanks rather than on saving houses, and angry residents responded by pelting the trucks with stones. They piled their belongings in the street and began fighting the blaze themselves with buckets of water. The flames spread to within 24 feet of the state-owned petroleum company compound, said Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON>, deputy fire chief. Fire Chief Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Madriaga </PERSON> said a shift in the winds prevented the fire from reaching it. `` During the early stage, fire threatened the depot because there was a strong wind blowing in that direction,'' he said. `` However, wind direction changed and the fire near the depot was placed under control.'' <PERSON> Madriaga </PERSON> estimated that more than 1,000 dwellings, mostly squatter shanties, were razed before the fire was brought under control after 4 -LCB- hours. The cause of the blaze had not been determined. Hundreds of people huddled around the mounds of personal belongings as scattered fires continued to burn into the night. There was no immediate estimate of damage. But <PERSON> Madriaga </PERSON> said the blaze was `` possibly the biggest in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> since World War II.'' He said flames destroyed a candy warehouse and virtually every building in a 25-acre area along the <LOCATION> Pasig </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which runs through the heart of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Oil companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Caltex </ORGANIZATION> and the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> maintain storage tanks in the area. The presidential palace is about 1 -LCB- miles away on the other side of the river. Firemen said they were unable to move trucks into the crowded shantytown alleys and concentrated their efforts on keeping the fire from the oil tanks. Troops armed with M-16 rifles were sent to the depot after the residents began throwing stones at the fire trucks. <PERSON> Madriaga </PERSON> said the injured included three civilians and a fireman who was struck by a water hose. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, operations manager of the national oil company, said the squatter area was `` too congested for even the best firefighters to have been able to battle the flames very well.'' Shanty homes in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are normally made of wood, cardboard and other flammable materials and are packed side-by-side. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayani </PERSON>, 27, whose home was destroyed, said she was attending a Bible study class about 3 p.m. -LRB- 3 a.m. EDT -RRB- when she heard children shouting `` Fire! Fire!'' She said the smoke seemed `` far away, but we started just the same bringing our things out.'' `` I saved our clothes and some kitchen utensils,'' she said. `` But we have no rice and no money.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bayani </PERSON> said her husband, <PERSON> Rogelio </PERSON>, worked in the burned-out candy warehouse and will probably lose his job. `` We will stay here during the night,'' she said. `` But I do n't know what we will do tomorrow.

<HEAD>Price of Imported Goods Rose 1.2 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The price of imported goods, one of the main inflationary threats facing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, rose 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year, a slight improvement from the end of last year, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the first quarter increase followed a 1.6 percent rise in import prices in the last three months of 1987 and credited the slowdown to continued declines in energy costs and a more stable dollar. The price of oil and other imported energy products fell 8 percent during the first quarter. Without this decline, overall import prices would have risen by 2.3 percent, almost twice as fast as the actual overall increase. At the same time, the cost of American products being sold overseas rose by 1.4 percent during the first quarter, a drop from a 2 percent price increase in the final three months of 1987. This change was credited to a big slowdown in the cost of exported food products, which rose only 0.6 percent in the first quarter after shooting up by 9.1 percent in the fourth quarter. American grain prices rose 3.1 percent following a 14.2 percent jump in the fourth quarter as a drop in wheat prices helped to offset continued increases in rice and corn prices. The price of American meat products rose 5.1 percent following six months of declines while the index for fruits and vegetables fell for the fourth consecutive quarter. On the import side, foreign cars and machinery, which account for nearly one-half of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports, rose 1.7 percent in the first quarter after increasing 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, the dollar declined in value against other currencies by 1.4 percent. This was a substantial slowdown from a 5.8 percent plunge in the dollar's value during the fourth quarter. It reflected the massive buying of dollars on foreign currency markets which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries have been doing this year to brake the greenback's fall. Overall consumer prices rose 4.4 percent last year, up from a 1.1 percent rise in 1986. A turnaround in the cost of imported energy and higher import prices generally were blamed for much of the worsening in inflation last year. This year many economists are looking for a further rise in consumer inflation of between 4 percent and 5 percent as the weaker dollar continues to push up the cost of imports. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, led by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, launched an effort in September 1985 to drive the value of the dollar lower in an effort to shrink the country's huge foreign trade deficits. In February 1987, the major industrial countries switched course and started a coordinated effort to keep the dollar from falling further. However, that effort failed last year as market forces continued to batter the dollar on the assumption that continued high monthly trade deficits pointed up a need for a still-lower dollar to reduce Americans' appetite for imports.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship was towing the stricken USS Bonefish to port today after salvage crews found the bodies of three crewmen aboard the submarine, apparently killed when explosions and fire filled the vessel with toxic smoke and gases. The bodies were found Wednesday aboard the 30-year-old, diesel-electric sub, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> refused to say when the bodies would be returned to grieving relatives ashore. Salvors from the USS Petrel and USS Hoist cautiously vented toxic fumes from the fire before the salvage crew could enter and the Hoist take the crippled submarine in tow. Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowery </PERSON> said today that the submarine was expected to arrive in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, in two to four days, depending on the weather. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> is the Bonefish's home port and 87 of the sub's surviving 89 crew members have been taken there The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> refused to say if the bodies of Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Everts </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Naoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordelon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 39, of <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Pisgah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, were removed from the sub The Bonefish was forced to the surface Sunday about 160 miles off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast after an explosion rocked the 219-foot vessel's forward battery compartment. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the three were last seen in the vessel's control room and might have died while saving their shipmates. `` That was his job _ getting people out,'' said <PERSON> Bordelon </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> David </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Willis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> `` That was his responsibility, and <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> is the kind who would help anybody.'' <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, said her son `` was a super boy, a super son, and became a super man when he went into the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. He dearly loved it. And I've never heard anyone describe their job as gloriously as <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> did.'' Only two of the 22 crewmen suffering smoke inhalation from the accident remain hospitalized in the <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Both are in satisfactory condition and are expected to be in the hospital a week. The 30-year-old Bonefish is one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s few remaining diesel-electric subs, driven by diesel engines while on the surface and by battery-powered electric motors while submerged. Recharging those batteries generates hydrogen gas, which can explode if allowed to accumulate. The Bonefish's initial explosion occurred while the sub was at periscope depth. The sub was able to surface and Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 42, the ship's captain, ordered the crew evacuated in the face of heavy smoke and toxic fumes. They were taken off the sub by helicopter and whaleboat from the aircraft carrier <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the frigate USS Carr, both of which were participating in exercises with the sub. The last battery explosion aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diesel-electric sub was in 1949 off the Norwegian coast, when the USS Cochino went down after a similar series of explosions during a gale. The crew was successfully evacuated to the submarine USS Tusk, but seven Tusk crew members died in the rescue.

<HEAD>Louisiana Legislative Committee Backs Repeal Of AIDS Testing Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee voted unanimously to repeal a law that requires people getting married to be tested for exposure to the AIDS virus a day after an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> legislative committee approved a bill to repeal a similar law. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> law has chased hundreds of young couples to neighboring <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to be married, said Rep. <PERSON> Alphonse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>. He said some physicians and laboratories charged as much as $ 200 for the tests. The day before the vote Wednesday in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted to repeal that state's law. Both laws went into effect Jan. 1. Although the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> repeal faces continued opposition from legislators who say it is premature, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> committee members predicted easy passage. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> repeal is backed by physicians, hospitals and even the author of the testing law. Committee members said they had no idea how many positive cases were discovered as a result of the tests because <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s confidentiality laws prohibit disclosure of such information In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, repeal supporters said that premarital testing uncovered one case of acquired immune deficiency syndrome for every 4,000 people tested. Dr. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON>, a physician with the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that the test is not foolproof. `` A negative means they've not had a chance to build up antibodies but it does n't mean the virus is not there,'' she said. A direct test for the virus, which attacks the body's immune system and leaves it susceptible to fatal cancers and viruses, is being developed but will be expensive, <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON> also said that those getting married are n't in the high-risk groups, which include homosexual men and drug abusers who share needles.

 Three <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members asked colleagues today to oppose a package of sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> which they say amounts to a `` scorched earth'' policy that will hurt blacks. The three _ Reps. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bereuter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> _ wrote a letter to members of the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as the panel prepared to vote on the sanctions package. The package would impose tough sanctions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> such as prohibitions on all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment, on all imports from that country, excluding strategic minerals, and on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to the nation, except donations to relieve human suffering. Supporters of the bill, including Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Penn., and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., say the sanctions are needed because the limited restrictions imposed on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1986 have failed to reform the apartheid system of But the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members say the sanctions have backfired in some cases, and tightening them will worsen the economic situation for blacks. `` Apartheid is breaking down despite, not because of, sanctions,'' they said in a three-page letter. They claim the sanctions have hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests and stricter bans will throw black South Africans out of work. They cite a study by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION>, which said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> lost $ 365 million in pension funds because of divestment measures. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> letter claimed that a study by <ORGANIZATION> COSATU </ORGANIZATION>, the South African black labor union, estimated that 2 million more South Africans would be out of work by the year 2000 if sanctions are increased. The three Republicans urged their colleagues to support their substitute measure which does not repeal the 1986 sanctions, but attempts to target <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to blacks. Among other things, the substitute would provide housing loan guarantees to blacks and encourage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses to help the black business sector. They said the substitute would lead to positive developments in the black community, in contrast to the Dellums-Wolpe legislation, which `` takes a total ` scorched earth' approach.''

The percentages were 46 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 45 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 9 percent uncommitted. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, executive director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the official tabulation had been slowed by mistakes found in some community caucuses. He said, for example, that in several communities, more delegates were elected than had been allocated to that town.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> told American servicemen and their dependents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> today to reduce the amount of time they spend in public areas, citing the probability of new demonstrations against strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.

The Pentagon said the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> had raised the so-called Personnel Movement Limitation to a `` Bravo'' status, effective at 10 a.m. EDT. Under the Bravo alert status, American servicemen and dependents are instructed to `` decrease visibility'' because `` some civil disturbance activity is probable.''

<TEXT>
 A Politburo member appeared today at the huge <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> steel mills, where management declared a strike by thousands of workers illegal and reportedly threatened to call in riot police to end the three-day walkout. Organizers said 16,000 workers, or half the work force, were on strike at the mills outside the southern city of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> to demand higher pay. It is <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s largest work stoppage since martial law stifled the independent Solidarity labor union 6 -LCB- years ago. Negotiations at the <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> works broke off early today. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Politburo and the head of the <ORGANIZATION> All-Poland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, was at the mill and said another government official, Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Szalajda </PERSON>, also was expected. <PERSON> Szalajda </PERSON> is the government's industrial policy chief The personal involvement of two senior officials indicated a high level of official concern about the strike, which comes only a few days before official May Day celebrations, an annual time of protest for government opponents. <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, who began his career as a steel worker at the Lenin plant in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, is the head of the union alliance created in 1982 to take Solidarity's place. Asked by a Western reporter about the possibility of using force to break the strike, <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think that will be necessary.'' In other developments, about 100 people staged a brief rally in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> in support of the strike. Solidarity activists in the southeastern Polish city of <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> reaffirmed their call for a strike Friday at an 18,000-worker heavy machinery plant there. The government has raised prices 42 percent so far this year as part of a program to make the economy more market-oriented, and there is widespread discontent that wages are lagging behind inflation. The 16-member strike committee was formally notified by a prosecutor today that their strike was illegal, and company foremen were distributing forms in which each worker was asked to declare in writing whether or not he was on strike. But the committee said it would ignore the prosecutor's letter and told workers not to sign the forms, said <PERSON> Zygmunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenyk </PERSON>, an opposition activist in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. Amid signs of increasing tension at the plant, negotiations with the strike committee that began at midnight lasted just 15 minutes, and one committee member said they were told by a director that if a political solution was not found soon, `` the ZOM0 -LRB- special riot police -RRB- will take over.'' On Wednesday, the strikers rejected a government offer that nearly met their demand for a 50 percent pay increase. Management later told strike leaders that if no agreement was reached, it `` would not be responsible for the security of the strikers,'' Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said today in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Handzlik </PERSON>, a strike committee member, said by telephone that more than 12,000 strikers were at the plant this morning. Organizers said workers were rotating inside the plant, staying two shifts then going home for one. Outwardly, the plant appeared calm, with no banners and little activity. The government was to enter talks today with city transit workers in <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Torun </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Grudziadz </PERSON>, who are seeking higher wages. On Monday, transit workers in the northwestern city of <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> staged an 11-hour strike and won a 60 percent raise. A day later, the strike began at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> mills. Organizers said it was spontaneous. The labor troubles are <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most serious since the yearlong heyday of the now-outlawed Solidarity trade union movement, which ended with the government's December 1981 crackdown. Strikes of occupation were then violently broken up by riot police and hundreds of union supporters interned. Solidarity Chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, in a statement issued from his home in the northern port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Wednesday, urged Poles to `` put pressure on the authorities'' and called for the restoration of Solidarity's legal status. The strikers at the steel mills have demanded the government double the current $ 15 compensation for the price increases for industrial workers, retirees, teachers and health workers. For themselves, they demanded an immediate 50 percent raise in their average $ 105 monthly pay. <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, the Solidarity adviser, said they turned down a management offer of a $ 50 raise to be phased in by October. Strikes over higher prices have a long tradition in postwar <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and caused government shakeups in 1956, 1970 and 1980.

 Truckers are continuing to protest the special 55 mph speed limit on <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> interstates for trucks over 13 tons, state police said today. Trucks are creeping along Interstate 70 in convoys from the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> line to the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> border, troopers said. Three westbound convoys involving at least 120 trucks passed through the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> area about 10 p.m. Wednesday. A <LOCATION> Pennyslvania </LOCATION> man was arrested during a 67-truck convoy Tuesday night following a scuffle with a trooper. No disturbances were reported Wednesday night, a dispatcher at the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> post said. Other dispatchers said some trucks were using both lanes and blocking traffic. The convoys at times were moving below the state's minimum speed limit of 40 mph. A new state law that went into effect April 1 covers only heavier trucks. Autos and light trucks may drive 65 mph on rural interstates.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> has recruited 15 new black teachers, three times the goal set last year by the university's president. The new faculty represent the university's commitment `` to action _ not just words _ in creating an environment that welcomes minorities to this campus,'' President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> said Wednesday in a statement. This year, there are 29 blacks among the 2,000 faculty on campus. Even though the numbers of black faculty are still relatively small, the new hirings may give the university the highest number of black faculty at any research university in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> McBee </PERSON>, acting vice president for academic affairs. The additional black faculty members also should help the university attract more members of minority groups, <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> said. About 5 percent of the university's full-time student body of almost 25,000 is black. All but one of the new faculty are in tenure-track positions; 13 will enter at the assistant professor level. They will begin work in the fall.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today approved a ban on federal money for programs that distribute clean needles to drug addicts unless the surgeon general finds that such methods will curb the spread of AIDS. The amendment to an AIDS research and information spending bill was a compromise reached after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected two outright bans pushed by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, R-N. The conditional ban was approved on a voice vote after a 70-27 vote to modify the outright ban. The AIDS bill, sponsored by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, is attracting a plethora of controversial amendments ranging from the clean-needle ban to restrictions on federally funded AIDS education materials Public health authorities in some places are trying to stem the rapid spread of AIDS among drug addicts by allowing them to turn in dirty needles which may be contaminated and receive clean ones. `` It's far too early to make a final judgment on the needle-exchange program. The results are mixed. There has n't been adequate research,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, sponsor of the compromise amendment. The amendment says money under the bill could not go for clean needles for individuals for the purpose of using illegal drugs, unless the surgeon general finds such programs help stop either drug addiction or the spread of AIDS. After the vote <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> condemned the compromise, saying Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> has already said needle-exchange programs may be a good idea. `` It's just a matter of time'' before federal money is spent on them, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. Earlier today, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 59-37 against a broader <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> ban _ the second time in two days it had rejected similar versions of his amendment. Lawmakers said both versions could have deprived drug addicts with AIDS of intravenous feeding, experimental drugs and other treatment. The Kennedy-Hatch bill authorizes $ 665 million for state and federal information and education campaigns, home health care for AIDS patients, new hiring at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, and special projects targeted to drug abusers and minorities. It also authorizes open-ended research spending, expected to bring the total to about $ 1 billion. AIDS testing, confidentiality and discrimination are addressed in a separate bill that has not reached the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. But they were among the issues senators planned to raise with their amendments. One of the most controversial proposals was a <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> attempt to renew a ban on federal money for education or information materials that promote, encourage or condone homosexual activities. A similar <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> provision adopted last year on a 94-2 vote is due to expire Sept. 30. Denouncing an educational AIDS videotape aimed at gay men, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said Wednesday, `` I will strongly oppose the use of taxpayers' money to advocate or condone sexual activity outside of monogamous marriage. At least one senator who supported the Helms amendment last year said he was leading a crusade against it this year. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he is convinced the amendment is having fatal consequences because AIDS service organizations have not received new money since last November He said the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> had asked them not to apply for funds until the situation is clarified. `` We must oppose every attempt to censor vital lifesaving information about AIDS,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agreed by voice vote Wednesday to another <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment to overturn the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s ban on AIDS testing for insurance applicants. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said diabetics and many other groups of people are unable to get health insurance because of their conditions. His amendment prevailed on a quick voice vote despite arguments by others that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should not override a law passed by the <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The vote against the original <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> clean-needle amendment was 66-18. Several senators said the amendment was written so broadly it would have denied hospices, hospitals, nursing homes and researchers the use of hypodermics and syringes. And they said the federal government should n't tie the hands of states, cities and researchers trying to curb the spread of the fatal disease among intravenous drug users.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner left <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> without getting what they wanted and no concessions were made to obtain the hostages' release, the Algerian ambassador said today. Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahnoun </PERSON> also said that while his government would have liked to apprehend the hijackers, such a move would have damaged its credibility as a mediator in international crises such as attempts to obtain the release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pressing <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> for information on the deal it worked out last week for the release of 31 hostages held by Moslem extremists in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they do not have clear indications that the pro-Iranian hijackers left <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, despite reports that they were flown last Wednesday from <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and then made their way to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sahnoun </PERSON>, addressing reporters at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said the hijackers `` went back without achieving anything.'' He declined to divulge details, saying that would be breaking <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s word to the hijackers and would damage its role as a mediator who has negotiated dozens of disputes over the past 25 years. `` We have a skill that we put at the disposal of the international community,'' he said. `` This is not always understood,'' he added, in apparent reference to demands by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries that <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> help capture the hijackers and bring them to trial. `` We delivered what we could deliver,'' namely the hostage release, he said. `` There was a price to pay, we are not entirely satisfied'' that the men went free, <PERSON> Sahnoun </PERSON> said. `` But this was a minimum price compared with what they wanted.'' The hijackers did not get what they wanted _ the release of 17 suspected terrorists imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, he added. There have been reports that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> canceled the death sentence against three of the 17. But <PERSON> Sahnoun </PERSON> insisted that `` no concessions were made.'' The Americans `` basically understood'' the Algerian position, he said. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has been asked to help in efforts to obtain the release of some 20 hostages, among them eight Americans, believed held by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, he said. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> had in the past supplied information it obtained about the hostages to their families, <PERSON> Sahnoun </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Ruling Could Open Videotape Coffers to Performers Who Sold Movie
Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court ruling may allow performers who sold the rights to their work in films to make more money once those movies are released on videotape. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 9th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> held Wednesday that a license giving a movie studio the right to show a film on television does not necessarily apply to videotape sales. The court ruled in a case brought against <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. It involved the rights to the song `` Merry-Go-Round,'' written by <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> and used in the 1969 film `` Medium Cool.'' Paramount officials declined to discuss the decision, but industry attorneys said it may result in the renegotiation of tens of thousands of licenses and contracts. Mainly affected will be movies made in the 1950s and'60s, after television was invented but before the videocassette recorder became popular enough for video rights to be included in contracts, attorneys said. `` This will cause music publishers to re-examine their contracts from the 1950s and beyond to see if they granted rights to television only,'' said attorney <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who successfully argued the case. `` There are probably a lot of contracts around just gathering dust,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, an entertainment law specialist. `` Many people may want to dust them off now.'' In the Paramount case, a licensing agreement allowed the filmmaker to use the song in television and theater showings of `` Medium Cool.'' Paramount argued that `` videocassette display is the equivalent of ` exhibition ... by means of television,''' said Judge <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. But Hug wrote for the court: `` We can not agree.'' `` Though videocassettes may be displayed by using a television monitor, it does not follow that, for copyright purposes, videocassettes constitute ` exhibition by television.''' A similar distinction caused several <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> songs to be pulled from the 1982 film `` Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' when it went into videotape production. The studio had not included videotapes in the original agreement and was unable to negotiate rights with <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> later, said the singer's attorney, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Paterno </PERSON>. How much money is at stake over such renegotiations is unclear.

 State security agents arrested at least eight opposition leaders and sought others today hours before a planned mass demonstration against the rule of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The arrest of all leaders of the National Civic Crusade was ordered Wednesday night by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s attorney general under a law prohibiting `` tumultuous meetings'' aimed at `` intimidating or threatening'' others. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> told American servicemen and their dependents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to reduce the amount of time they spend in public areas, citing the probability of demonstrations against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The command also ordered <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> schools on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> end of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to close at noon EDT, said Capt. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLuntas </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The attorney general, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalaz </PERSON>, said the order applied to the 35 directors of the group, plus an unspecified number of neighborhood leaders of the planned demonstration. Many crusade leaders have been in hiding since their headquarters in a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotel was raided following a mass demonstration on March 28. More than 40 people were arrested in that sweep, including eight foreign journalists. All but one of those arrested last month were released within a few days. The exception was <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON>, a top leader of the group who was held for 10 days and then fled into exile in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The National Civic Crusade is a coalition of about 200 professional, labor, business, civic, political and other groups that has been seeking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster since June. It is supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is leader of the nation's defense forces and controls the government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has imposed sweeping economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster. The sanctions have created a severe cash shortage in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The National Civic Crusade announced plans last week for a demonstration this afternoon along more than 30 blocks of the capital's main commercial avenue. Largely through handbills and word of mouth, it had been urging a massive turnout. The group has been unable to mount a large-scale demonstration since last month's rally and march by an estimated 10,000 supporters was smashed by riot police and soldiers using water cannons, tear gas, shotguns and rubber truncheons. Police arrested a number of opposition leaders a few days before another planned mass demonstration last Oct. 22. None were held for more than four days, but the demonstration collapsed for lack of leadership and apparent fear of arrest by supporters. The attorney general said raids on several offices and homes by state security agents earlier this week had turned up what he called crusade plans for `` urban violence'' aimed at destabilizing the country. Among offices raided were those of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Odontological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. All three organizations complained that the raids were conducted without proper search warrants. Among those arrested was <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. The Society isued a statement calling his detention `` one more proof of the constant violation of human rights by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> of the Republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.''

 Their steps may be a bit slower, their eyes dimmer, but oh how they remember the night 50 years ago when residents danced away the last hours of four towns that died to provide drinking water for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. More than 100 former residents _ the oldest in her 90s _ and 300 descendants of the <LOCATION> Swift </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> towns gathered Wednesday for the 50th anniversary of the last dance at <ORGANIZATION> Enfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>. And they remembered the night of April 27, 1938, when the towns of <PERSON> Dana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Enfield </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> flickered out of existence at midnight to create the Quabbin Reservoir. The reservoir took 20 years to build and cost $ 53 million and the lives of more than 20 workers. Today, it provides drinking water for 2.5 million people, half of the state's population. It's not the nation's largest reservoir, though none larger has been built strictly to provide drinking water. But for 2,500 people, the land under the water had been home. The ball marked the end of that life. `` My mother was crying. The older people were heartbroken,'' recalled <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> <PERSON> Thresher </PERSON>, dancing with <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, her husband of 50 years. They were the last couple married in <LOCATION> Enfield </LOCATION>. They remember the ball. `` There was such a crowd at Town Hall that night we young people could n't get in,'' she said. `` We climbed the fire escape and looked in the windows.'' A hush fell over the crowd in the ballroom at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> as the bell that had once hung in the Dana Town Hall struck midnight. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, the High Sheriff of <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, dressed in top hat and tails, led the former residents in singing `` <LOCATION> Auld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Syne </LOCATION>'' just as the dancers had in 1938. Men who had been young then bowed their heads. Tears glistened in many eyes as the sound of `` Taps'' echoed across the stilled ballroom. `` Our home was in the center of town. It now lies under the deepest part of the reservoir,'' said <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bock </PERSON>, a South <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> elementary school teacher, who was in grade school back then. `` My parents had six children and they could n't afford to go to the dance. But we kids went down to the Town Hall and watched the people arriving,'' she said. Her brother, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, came from <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> for the event as did three sisters and another brother. `` I would n't have missed this for the world,'' said <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalbird </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, 78, of <LOCATION> Enfield </LOCATION>, as 38 former residents who had been at the Farewell Ball led the Grand March around the hall. Many of the women wore heirloom pins and other mementos of parents and grandparents. Some wore black as did many of the women at the dance 50 years ago. Their reminiscences, jotted down on their dance programs, were read aloud between dance tunes. `` My son is 50 now. He was one of the last babies born in <LOCATION> Enfield </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Somers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. She and her husband <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, 75, married others when they lived in <LOCATION> Enfield </LOCATION> They did not meet again until they both began attending the weekly teas held for former residents at the Quabbin Visitors Center. They were married on Valentine's Day in 1987. `` We did n't think we ought to waste any time,'' she said.

<HEAD>Recordings of Bird Sounds Inspire Chick On To Freedom</HEAD>

 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor chick, inspired by recordings of vulture hisses and grunts, was slowly chipping its way out of its shell today, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Wild Animal Park officials said. `` Everything is proceeding fine,'' park spokeswoman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said this morning. `` The chick is moving around inside the shell and the condor keepers can hear the chick tapping.'' `` What we're trying to do is provide a natural stimulus to the bird to assist it in hatching,'' spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanscom </PERSON> said Wednesday. The chick, the first ever of the nearly extinct species to be conceived in captivity, began its three-day struggle to break free of its blue-green egg early Wednesday. A successful hatching would raise the population to 28. All 27 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors are in captivity, 14 at the Wild Animal Park and 13 at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said park officials still expect the chick to hatch Friday or Saturday. If the chick has n't emerged from its shell by 4 a.m. Saturday, keepers likely will help it out, <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. Meanwhile, keepers are playing recordings of bird noises and gently tapping the egg with a light metal rod every two hours to simulate what condor parents would do to encourage the youth, he said. The chick has settled into a rhythm of pecking and resting, punctuated by cheeps, and appears to be strong and healthy, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Toone </PERSON>, curator of birds at the park. `` At this point, it will continue to push at the pip hole and situate itself so that it will attempt to cap the egg,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said, referring to the chick's chipping all the way around the egg so it can push the upper third of the shell away from the rest. The egg is being watched on a remote television monitor but keepers are reluctant to help the chick because of the danger that blood vessels linked to a surrounding membrane will rupture, which could cause fatal bleeding. Since 1983, there have been 14 successful condor hatchings at the Wild Animal Park and the affiliated <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Zoo involving eggs taken from the wild. All of those hatchings occurred with human help, although one of those chicks died of an infection 24 hours after birth. The egg was laid March 3 at the park's `` condorminium'' after its parents engaged in the first captive mating in the history of a 15-year program aimed at saving <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest land bird. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors, which are scavengers, have wing spans of up to 10 feet. State and federal wildlife officials overseeing the condor program decided to remove the remaining condors in the wild to focus efforts on a captive breeding flock. The last known <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor in the wild was captured in April 1987.

 The state that's home to the Grand Canyon and the Petrified Forest will soon acquire another natural wonder _ a spectacular 2 -LCB- - mile cavern kept secret for years for fear it would be vandalized The Legislature and Gov. Rose Mofford on Wednesday rushed to enact legislation allowing the state to acquire the cavern discovered 14 years ago near <LOCATION> Benson </LOCATION> in southeast <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> perched a spelunker's helmet atop her beehive hairdo as she signed the bill passed by lawmakers only an hour earlier. The cave's existence had been a closely held secret since it was discovered in 1974, because its owners feared vandals would destroy its beauty. `` It is a major natural resource find,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Travous </PERSON>, who has twice squeezed through the tiny opening to view the cavern. `` It's fabulous,'' <PERSON> Travous </PERSON> said. `` Walt Disney could n't have done any better for the state of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Your imagination goes crazy when you get down there.'' The cavern is about 13,000 feet long with rooms the size of football fields and ceilings from 50 to 100 feet high. Thousands of still-growing stalagmites and stalactites ranging from a few inches to 60 feet are found throughout. It's also home to a colony of 700 bats. In about three years, <PERSON> Travous </PERSON> says, about 100,000 to 150,000 people a year will get to travel by elevator to see the cave. Officials plan to use state park revenues to acquire the site for $ 1.6 million within a year from the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservancy </ORGANIZATION>, which soon will buy the site from the family of the late <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartchner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cochise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> rancher and educator. `` I imagine I walked over this thing I do n't know how many times hunting deer'' but never realized the cavern was underneath, said Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Arzberger </PERSON>, whose district includes the cave. The state on Friday sent <ORGANIZATION> park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> rangers </ORGANIZATION> to guard the site on an emergency basis as word of the cavern's existence began to leak out. The bill was quickly enacted Wednesday to allow the state to continue to oversee the land. The cavern's co-discoverer, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tufts </PERSON>, 39, said that finding it along with <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenen </PERSON>, 37, was `` a once in a lifetime discovery for the caver.'' `` People go out and hunt and hunt and hunt for caves; 99 times out of 100 you never find anything,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> said he and <PERSON> Tenen </PERSON> wanted the cavern turned into a park because that would be the best way to protect it from vandals. Because it is near a major highway, <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> said it was inevitable that other people would find it. <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> said he had been into the cavern hundreds of times. `` It's very colorful ... The variety of formations is very wide,'' and it still is an actively changing cave, <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> said. Four of <LOCATION> Kartchner </LOCATION>'s 12 children attended Wednesday's legislative session and bill-signing. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartchner </PERSON>, a physician, said family members were aware of the cave but not its splendor. `` We climbed in it, there were rattlesnakes, and we climbed back out -LRB- with -RRB- no idea of the magnificence of the structure,'' <PERSON> Kartchner </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The Soviet Union today accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of violating the Afghan accords by sending new arms to rebels fighting to topple the communist government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was violating its obligations as a guarantor of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement on a Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. At a news briefing, <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said that if news reports saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was resupplying Afghan guerrillas are true, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would be violating its pledge not to interfere in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, on Wednesday that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was airlifting arms to the guerrillas to replace weapons destroyed when a Pakistani ammunition depot exploded April 10. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> also declined comment on a Pravda article that raised the question of whether the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would accept pro-Soviet Afghan refugees in the event of a rebel takeover. He said he had not seen the article. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper today published a report on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that was highly unusual in depicting the concerns of Afghan party and military officials about the implications of the Soviet troop withdrawal, scheduled to begin May 15. The Soviets have an estimated 115,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. More typical reports in the state-run media have said the April 14 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, which commits the Soviets to a pullout, increases opportunities for a peaceful settlement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 10-year-old civil war But many Western observers doubt the Marxist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, which was unable to defeat a widespread insurgency with Soviet aid, will be able to withstand guerrilla attacks once the Soviets are gone. `` In questions and replies, you could sense the deep alarm evinced by ... those people who have actively fought the counterrevolution: What will become of them when we leave?'' wrote Col. <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Studenikin </PERSON>, a Pravda special correspondent. There have been reports that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has issued cards to top members of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government to allow them to board Soviet-bound planes if the guerrillas gain the upper hand. Those reports have never been confirmed. The Afghan civil war has forced more than 5 million people to flee, chiefly to neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Few of them, if any, back the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government. <PERSON> Studenikin </PERSON> wrote that some people have asked whether the Soviets have agreed to take 500,000 Afghan refuguees. The article, titled `` The Road Home,'' gave clear indications of the joy and relief felt by Soviets as their country's military involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which began in December 1979, is about to end. According to Western estimates, as many as 10,000 Soviet soldiers have been killed. Pravda said it had received thousands of letters from its readers about the withdrawal, which Soviet officials have said privately should be concluded by the end of the year. <PERSON> Studenikin </PERSON> wrote: `` I feel like telling all of them who will soon be taking this road home ... ` The whole country with impatience awaits your return.'''

 Masked gunmen shot and killed a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemeni </LOCATION> businessman today as left his home to catch an early flight to <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, police said. A police spokesman identified the businessman as <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kashim </PERSON> or <PERSON> Kasim </PERSON>, 39, and said he carried a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> diplomatic passport. Two gunmen got out of a parked car as <PERSON> Kashim </PERSON> walked out of an apartment block at 4:30 a.m. -LRB- 9:30 p.m. Wednesday EDT -RRB- in the suburb of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phaleron </LOCATION>, said the spokesman, who requested anonymity in accordance with Greek practice. <PERSON> Kashim </PERSON> carried his luggage and was accompanied by his sister-in-law, the spokesman said. One of the men opened fire with a sawed-off shotgun, hitting <PERSON> Kashim </PERSON> in the elbow and abdomen. As the businessmen tried to flee, the gunman ran after him and fired twice more, hitting him in the head, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Kashim </PERSON>'s sister-in-law was not hurt, he said. The gunmen got away, and no group immediately claimed responsibility for the killing. A police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Kashim </PERSON> had been living in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> with his wife and family for the past year, and was planning to open a supermarket in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. `` He apparently was selling off some businesses in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and was transferring his activities to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>,'' the source said. There is no South <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. A Foreign Ministry official said <PERSON> Kashim </PERSON> was not registered as a foreign diplomat resident in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The police spokesman said <PERSON> Kashim </PERSON> was booked on an early morning <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. The last attack against an Arab in the Greek capital took place in December 1987, when an Iraqi diplomat working for the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> was shot and wounded while driving through the <LOCATION> Psychico </LOCATION> suburb. Past attacks here have included killings of Libyan exiles and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials and attempts against Jordanian and Iraqi diplomats. None of the cases has been solved.

<HEAD>Judge Bars Girl Scouts From Withdrawing Charter of Inner-City

 A federal judge today barred the national Girl Scouts organization from withdrawing the charter of an inner-city council that serves more than 2,000 girls. Parents and troop leaders of the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> council oppose the plans of the national organization to transfer jurisdiction of their scouts, who are mostly members of minority groups, to mainly white, suburban councils. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> ordered the national organization to show why the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> council should not receive a new six-year charter. The parents said they found it particularly galling that the national group would try to end their charter when pictures of <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> Girl Scouts and troop leaders have appeared on a nationally distributed poster extolling the Girl Scouts as an integrated organization. The national organization has said the charter should be withheld because of declining membership and financial difficulties. The girls would be `` better served by councils with strong management systems and better resources,'' said national spokeswoman <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She refused to comment further on the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> case. However, Ms. <PERSON> McEwan </PERSON> said she did not know of any other time the Girl Scouts had sought to remove or withhold a charter from one of the nation's 335 local councils, which include nearly 3 million adult and scout members. Councils are responsible for organizing troops, recruiting leaders and providing services for the troops, Ms. <PERSON> McEwan </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> parents argued that they can best provide well-integrated and family-like scouting groups in the inner-city setting of their <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> waterfront communities. Pictures of the local scouts and troop leaders also have appeared on Girl Scout cookie boxes and a 75th anniversary commemorative stamp, the council said. `` They liked all those ethnic backgrounds,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBlois </PERSON>, a Girl Scout mother and troop leader. `` I do n't understand -LRB- why -RRB- they want to split that up.'' Mrs. <PERSON> DeBlois </PERSON>, nine other mothers and the council sued <ORGANIZATION> Girl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scouts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> in federal court here. The suit also accuses the national organization of seeking to distribute proceeds from the $ 635,000 sale of a <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> campground.

 Decorations stolen from cemeteries in six counties have been returned by authorities who captured a 69-year-old woman with help from relatives guarding a burial plot. <PERSON> Elanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hueytown </LOCATION> pleaded guilty to taking decorations from hundreds of graves, a <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy said. Sheriff's Sgt. J.O. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said about 500 decorations, ranging from saddles used to hold floral arrangements, to vases and other items were recovered at the woman's house. <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> was fined $ 200 on April 13 and ordered to undergo psychiatric counseling. She also received a suspended six-month jail term and was put on two years' probation. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said Tuesday he went to the woman's home after relatives of a 15-year-old girl who died of heart problems solved the case. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> hid under her bed and `` I had to drag her out after I confronted her with what happened.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said the woman admitted stealing decorations at 34 cemeteries, and said he eventually returned all of the stolen decorations. `` Only the good Lord knows why she did it,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said, adding it took four truckloads to return the decorations. The deputy said relatives of a deceased 15-year-old had taken turns standing guard at a <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> cemetery after wind chimes began to disappear. One of the relatives noticed a woman taking objects from graves and told authorities after jotting down her car's license number. When he arrived at <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>'s house, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said, he saw the six stolen wind chimes dangling from her front porch. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> estimated 300 families had noticed cemetery thefts and many had reported them to authorities in their counties.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican presidential nominee in all but name, expressed eagerness to debate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and challenged the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner to `` fire away.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did just that _ and so did <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who criticized both men today in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, falling further behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> every week in the Democratic race, received cheers at a <LOCATION> Steubenville </LOCATION> rally with a speech focusing on fighting drugs and saving jobs. `` I do n't want to manage Reaganomics as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does, or keep <ORGANIZATION> Reaganomics </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I want to reverse Reaganomics and re-invest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` This is a tight race. ... It is closer now than ever before,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said a day earlier as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where 159 delegates are at stake in Tuesday's contest. He had a series of stops set around the state today. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> also vote Tuesday, offering 79 and 16 Democratic delegates respectively. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now has more than enough delegates to assure him the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. His boss, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, is holding off on a formal endorsement but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> indicated that one is near. <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and administration sources said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> planned to play a low-key role at the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s convention in August to avoid upstaging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president would address the convention on opening night _ Monday, Aug. 15 _ and then leave the next morning for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> remained reluctant to describe himself as the likely nominee despite a string of wins and a widening delegate lead. Any reference to a fall faceoff with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is cautiously qualified with an if. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was sounding increasingly relaxed and confident. He sent the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bruins </ORGANIZATION> hockey team a telegram Wednesday following a win over the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadiens </ORGANIZATION> that advanced them to the semifinals in the Stanley Cup series. `` Having enjoyed a few wins myself lately, I can well imagine how you feel,'' the governor wrote. `` Maybe your winning formula will rub off on me as I enter some playoffs of my own.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said there was `` no question'' that if nominated, he would debate the Republican nominee. `` I've already agreed to,'' he said. `` I'd be delighted.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he, too, was ready. `` I will have debates and I look forward to it,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>. The vice president has criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for lacking foreign policy experience. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor retaliated Wednesday by questioning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in `` one of the most misguided adventures in the history of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign policy'' _ the Iran-Contra affair. `` I ca n't imagine what they -LRB- in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- were thinking of when they proceeded to do business with a terrorist nation,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Where foreign policy is concerned, he added later, `` it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick. ... That's what makes for strong international leadership.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he expected <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to try to make the Iran-Contra affair a campaign issue. `` Let him fire away,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> for a fund-raiser on Wednesday night, also attacked the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration record on environmental issues, saying: `` It's about time we had an administration that did something about the environment.'' And, questioning whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s threat to veto a trade measure that won congressional approval on Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` I think the vice president would be well advised to stop criticizing others for a while and address some fundamental issues facing this country.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> objects to a provision of the bill that would provide workers with 60 days notice before a plant shuts down. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has a plant-closing law, but it does not require companies to notify the state of impending shutdowns, and critics say the measure lacks teeth.

 An unemployed handyman convicted of strangling seven women while having sex, then leaving their bodies to rot in and near his apartment, told a judge today he did not want a jury to decide whether he should get the death penalty. `` I want you,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> `` Marty'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said when Common Pleas Court Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latrone </PERSON> told him a jury could be called in to set the sentence. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 29, was convicted Wednesday of murder and abuse of corpse charges. He had waived a jury trial, but under <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law retained the right to have a jury for the sentencing portion of the case. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> lured the women to his apartment with the promise of drugs then strangled them during sex, according to his own confession to police. `` He deserves everything he gets,'' said <PERSON> Camilia </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShazor </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, the mother of one of <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s victims, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShazor </PERSON>. `` I still hate him.'' <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Artison </PERSON>, the father of another victim, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvin </PERSON>, said, `` I'm just numb. The way I feel is that there's nothing that can be done for my daughter. She is gone.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON>, seated in the first row of the City Hall courtroom, sat quietly and refused to comment later. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> did not testify during the trial, which started March 7. <PERSON> Latrone </PERSON>, who heard the case without a jury, deliberated for six days before rendering his verdict, and Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said afterwards that the state would `` actively seek the death penalty.'' In his confession admitted into evidence, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said the bodies began piling up in his bedroom and he began having problems with maggots. He also said birds eating body parts on his roof made sleeping during the day difficult. The bodies were found last Aug. 9 and 10 after <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was evicted from his apartment because of a putrid stench. He lived in a drug-infested north <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> neighborhood where he was known as a handyman. Police pried open a nailed door to find six rotting bodies in <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s bedroom, leg and foot bones on the roof of his apartment house and a torso in the basement of a neighboring house. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> surrendered to police Aug. 16 at his mother's urging. Defense attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moldovsky </PERSON> tried unsuccessfully to have the statement suppressed, arguing the confession was made in violation of <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s constitutional rights and that <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was beaten by police during 17 hours of interrogation. <PERSON> Moldovsky </PERSON> also asked Latrone to find <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> innocent by reason of insanity, characterizing the defendant as both psychotic and mentally retarded.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has disbanded a task force investigating the case of a teen-ager who was mysteriously assaulted because agents have found no evidence the teen-ager' civil rights were violated, according to a report published today. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s mother and a spokesman for the family insist Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> will tell her story of the still-unexplained assault to the public, not to a state grand jury, unless a federal grand jury probe is launched. <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, the victim's mother, said Wednesday the family would go to jail rather than force Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> to honor a request to testify contained in a letter from the grand jury that Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> called `` dumb.'' The 16-year-old teen-ager will ignore the Monday deadline set in the letter and will tell her story to the public at the end of this week if no federal investigation is launched, the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said Wednesday. Family members have described the incident as a sexual and racial assault on the teen-ager last fall. But three of the four agents investigating the case for violations of federal law have been reassigned since last week, leaving behind one agent to compile a report, according to today's <ORGANIZATION> Middletown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Record </ORGANIZATION> Sources close to the investigation say the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report wo n't be complete for another month. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said the grand jury had written to Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> and her mother, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, asking the youngster to come forward and warning that the panel could take action to try to force her to tell her story if she refuses to cooperate. `` It's dumb,'' <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> said of the grand jury's appeal. `` We've been through all this before. What makes them think we're going to all of a sudden bring <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> down there and talk to them? `` We think the federal government would move in much more impartially than Mr. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> has shown us at this point,'' said <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, referring to state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who is the special prosecutor for the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has had an agent assigned to the case since the then 15-year-old black girl was found Nov. 28 outside her family's former apartment in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, and the other three agents were added in February After a four-day disappearance, the teen-ager was found huddled in a trash bag with racial slurs scrawled on her torso and feces smeared on her body. She told family members she was a victim of a sexual and racial assault involving six white men, one of whom flashed a police-like badge.

 Federal prosecutors are increasingly concerned about vacancies at the top of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> which Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has been unable to fill for nearly a month. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys held a lengthy discussion about the vacancy in the department's No. 2 post, concluding in an informal vote that they want one of their colleagues, rather than someone from outside the department, to fill the position, said three department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. The consensus at Tuesday's meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, should be chosen by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to become deputy attorney general, said the sources. <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> is chairman of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys' advisory committee, but was not in the room at the time of the discussion by the panel's 15 or so members, said the sources. `` The sense at the meeting was that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys wanted <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>,'' said one source. `` They want someone who knows and understands <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys and who can hit the ground running.'' The sources said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys had not presented their views to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and that it was unclear whether they would do so. `` Neither <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> nor anyone else has offered me the position of deputy attorney general,'' <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> from his home Wednesday night. He declined further comment. The post of deputy attorney general became vacant last Friday with the departure of <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, who resigned March 29, telling colleagues <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s refusal to resign in the face of a nearly yearlong criminal investigation was damaging <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> operations. Criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> resigned with <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> for similar reasons. The concerns by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys about the top-level <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> vacancies come amid a report that a group of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s advisers and friends have joined forces to oust <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reacted heatedly when reporters queried him about the Wall Street Journal report, which said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> supported the effort. `` I thought the story was totally inaccurate,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who when asked what might prompt him to get rid of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, said: `` Well, if he had a complete change of character.'' The Journal said White House officials sounded out former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> as a possible successor to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, but that <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> rejected the proposal. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said: `` I did not have any suggestion that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should leave, and under no circumstances whatever would I even take the office, if it should be offered. It's never been offered.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that aides to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> were privately involved in efforts to force <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> from office. The newspaper did not identify the aides but said they have spread the word among Republican supporters in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, by remaining in office, is weakening the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency and could jeopardize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election campaign to succeed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had flown to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to attend a funeral on Wednesday and had a full work schedule Thursday. `` The attorney general not only has a full schedule for the rest of the week, but for the next couple of months. He is preparing for events in July and August. There is no question in my mind that he intends to fulfill his obligations as attorney general for the foreseeable future,'' <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has made two unsuccessful bids to fill <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' post. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> withdrew from consideration amid allegations by a former bookkeeper at his law firm that the two had an affair, and reports about his membership in all-white and all-male clubs. Shepherd denied the bookkeepers' allegations, but said the ensuing strain on his family had become intolerable. Earlier, former federal appeals court judge <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s overtures to become deputy attorney general, saying he had a heavy caseload at his <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> law firm. The office of deputy attorney general is vital to the effective functioning of the 93 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys' offices. The deputy makes key budget decisions that affect the offices and settles disputes between them. The advisory committee is an administrative group designed to keep the attorney general in touch with activities in the various <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys' offices around the country.

 Two airmen aboard an unarmed National Guard reconnaissance jet ejected and parachuted to safety just after the plane crash-landed, officials said today. The F-4 jet, returning from a training flight, crashed Wednesday night at <LOCATION> Reno-Cannon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and showered debris for 800 yards, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Landsberry </PERSON>, airport spokesman. `` They touched down and ejected and, luckily, they both walked away from it,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said today.

<TEXT>
 A painting attributed to impressionist <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON> was sold privately for $ 1.7 million despite doubts as to its authenticity. Experts say the painting of a naked woman reclining on a green cushion was too erotic to be a real <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON>. The 19th century master is best known for idealizing the female form, which he portrayed in cozy indoor settings as well as in the sun-washed outdoors. The sale originally was to be handled by <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Dassonval </PERSON>, director of the Septentrion Gallery in the northern French town of Marcq-en-Baroeul. <PERSON> Dassonval </PERSON> said he withdrew his services after the owner refused to have it formally examined by recognized experts. `` And she -LRB- the nude -RRB- was in too provocative a pose to have been the work of <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON>,'' he said. He declined to provide the names of either the seller or the buyer. <PERSON> Dassonval </PERSON> said experts first thought the work was <ORGANIZATION> Renoir </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nude on a Green Cushion,'' last sold in 1933 The painting has been in a private collection since then. They changed their minds after comparing photographs published in the auction catalogue with the painting in <LOCATION> Roubaix </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has chosen a low-profile role at the Republican National Convention that will name <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as his would-be successor, administration and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sources say. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is waiting to give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a formal endorsement, but presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said nothing should be made of that. `` He will endorse the vice president,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today. `` We do n't have a specific point for that to happen yet but it will be at some event where they will appear jointly, probably within the next couple of weeks.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> talked campaign strategy privately with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over lunch Wednesday and said the president plans to help wherever he can. During a picture-taking session Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deserved congratulations for locking up the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. Asked if he was ready to endorse <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he replied, `` Well, I'm going to have to arrive at that since there are no others entering'' the Republican presidential competition. During a Cable News Network interview, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` we've got to discuss that, whether it will be some formal endorsement. But when there will be some formal endorsement ceremony, we did n't have any agreement on that.'' Administration and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sources, discussing plans for the GOP convention on grounds they remain anonymous, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does n't want to steal the limelight from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. They said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decided to address the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> convention on opening night, Monday, Aug. 15. The sources also said, however, that he will not give the keynote address. The president's scheduling decision causes convention organizers to juggle the speakers' lineup. `` I think the president's view is that this is going to be a convention for the next nominee of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' one source said. `` It's the president's view that wherever he goes, he tends to be the focal point, so he wants to do it this way.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would leave for his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ranch on Tuesday morning, the source said. Another source said that there has been discussion of a Reagan televised address to the convention on the night <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accepts the nomination but that no decisions have been made.

 A family reunion led a deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal to renew an investigation into four 1980 killings that has resulted in the arrests of three people _ one of them his own brother.

Ballistics tests confirmed <PERSON> Olbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON>'s suspicions, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> were arrested this week. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON>, 51, was arrested on one count of hindering prosecution and one count of possession of a sawed-off shotgun, <LOCATION> Cleburne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON>, 39, was charged with five counts of perjury. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, 29, was arrested Wednesday on charges of first-degree perjury. <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> refused to comment on the timing of the arrests or whether the three were suspects in the killings. `` I'm just going to say they are people whom the grand jury saw fit to indict on those charges,'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said. The arrests came on indictments returned Tuesday by a county grand jury. The three men were being held in county jail in lieu of $ 100,000 bond each. Field said the grand jury will reconvene May 31 and that more indictments might be returned. Authorities said that <PERSON> Olbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON>'s seizure of the shotgun provided the first major break in their investigation. `` Without him, there would be no case,'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> said. `` It's an unusual story. My deputy has been involved in this indirectly since 1983 and directly involved since 1986.'' <PERSON> Olbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON>'s niece, <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Loveless </PERSON>, said she is not angry at him although he has worked to put her father, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON>, in jail. `` This is n't a vengeance thing,'' she said. `` They did n't have any falling out or anything like that. My uncle is a lawman and he is just doing his job. My father is just telling the truth _ that's all there is to it. Police believe the motive in the killing was $ 1,500 in cash kept in a trunk. The trunk was stolen and recovered two years later in woods three miles from the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> home.

 More than 1,700 people likely will die in the next seven years from illnesses caused by the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> gas leak, the 1984 disaster that already has killed nearly 3,000 people, a report said Thursday. The predictions were contained in a $ 285 million plan by the <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state government for providing relief to both future and past <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> victims and their families. The seven-year plan is based on a projected annual death rate of 250 people. Among those targeted for financial help are 509 women widowed by the tragedy and 27 orphans, the state report said. The world's worst industrial disaster already has killed at least 2,998 people, the report said, a figure higher than the previously reported death toll of 2,800. It said the deaths were `` conclusively attributed'' to the effects of the toxic methyl-isocyanate gas that was released on Dec. 3, 1984, from a plant owned by a pesticide subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The central Indian state's study said another 816 deaths were being investigated for links to the gas leak. The Indian government has said in the past that it expected the death toll to rise, but Thursday's report was the first time it has detailed the anticipated scope of the casualties. `` It is not possible to assess the long-term damage,'' said the report released by the state's chief minister, <PERSON> Arjun </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> already has spent $ 46 million to assist disaster victims. Many victims develop respiratory problems that progress to the point where they cause death. Others became more prone to other diseases whose symptoms include fever, vomiting and diarrhea. The government said it also is conducting surveys to determine if the children of women exposed to the gas have a higher incidence of birth defects. The report calls for the creation of a special group to study the long-range effects of the gas. The Indian government is suing Carbide for $ 3 billion in damages. The civil suit is still being heard in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, the state capital. The government also has begun a criminal case against the company, several of its subsidiaries and current and former company officers. The Madhya Pradesh high court recently upheld an order by the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> civil judge, M.W. <PERSON> Deo </PERSON>, that <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> pay $ 192 million in interim relief to the gas victims. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the company has not yet decided whether to appeal the high court ruling. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> contends that the gas leak was caused by negligence. The company has said it resulted from sabotage by a disgruntled employee. Efforts to reach an out-of-court settlement in the case failed in November, although both sides agreed to continue talking. According to sources close to the talks last year, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> offered slightly more than $ 500 million to settle the case. About 540,000 people have filed claims for damages, and the Indian government is sorting through them to determine which are valid. The relief plan released Thursday calls for spending $ 110 million on medical relief; $ 1.7 million for economic rehabilitation; $ 52.2 million for social work; and $ 65.7 million for environmental improvements. Additional money would go to a disaster management institute and the long-term medical study. The plan also sets aside $ 192,000 per year to be distributed as financial aid to victim's families. The government pays a lump sum of $ 770 for each death.

 Secret documents seized from Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s office could expose `` people in very difficult situations to torture and death'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> if publicly disclosed, the prosecutor in the Iran-Contra case said today. At a hearing on providing classified documents to the defense, independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> that some of the documents contain information so sensitive that a person known to have seen it would be in endanger by travel to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` There were documents found in Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s safe he should n't have had'' under government security regulations, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said The material included compilations of highly sensitive information that is usually scattered in bits and pieces throughout other documents `` Why he had them I do n't know,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has ruled that the defense is entitled to see 300,000 pages of classified material collected by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> so that lawyers for North and three co-defendants can determine if any of the documents would help their case. Between 5 and 10 percent of the material is extremely sensitive, and government security experts are concerned about releasing it for inspection by at least one of North's co-defendants, businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` As advocates we have no interest in this whatever,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said, indicating a rift with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over disclosure. But government security experts are concerned about giving full access to <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, a security consultant who deals with governments in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, he said. `` I do n't see why he would like to have in his possession that type of information when he is traveling in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` He's put in jeopardy by that kind of information.'' The restriction sought by government security officials would also apply, at least temporarily, to retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, another defendant charged in the case, according to court papers. Lawyers for <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, however, could see the material. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the government had no objection to <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his former boss, one-time national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, examining all the documents being placed in a secure facility for defense lawyers to work with the material. `` Colonel North does n't pose the problem because most of these documents he's seen anyhow,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. North and his three co-defendants are charged with conspiring to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said resolving the issue might involve a month of secret hearings. Meanwhile, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters today that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is `` cooperating in every way'' and said `` we'll find a way to make everything available that we can as long as it is approved by this -LRB- screening -RRB- procedure.'' `` We intend to work with the court in the same way that we have in the past,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` and I would just add that the intelligence agencies' interagency committee that reviews the security classifications has received 70,000 pages of documents from the independent counsel. Forty-thousand pages have been cleared for production to the defense without restriction.'' The spokesman said `` we're operating very rapidly and we are concerned about methods and sources being divulged to witnesses who are not cleared to know those things. But this new procedure will allow the courts and the independent counsel to make decisions on any documents that are in dispute.'' According to court papers filed this week by <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s lawyers, the sensitive information the government seeks to protect includes documents that would expose hostages in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to death if released. Disclosure would also compromise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence gathering, military planning and sensitive foreign policy initiatives, according to a letter <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office sent to the defense earlier this week. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of intentionally withholding secret documents and threatened to dismiss the charges if the material is not made available to the defense. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, `` so far as I know, is making every effort to produce the documents,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` The responsibility lies with the attorney general and the White House. I want to find out promptly what is taking place and what is going to take place.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> denied there was any deliberate foot-dragging in preparing the documents for defense review. `` There is certainly no attempt being made to impede the process in any way,'' <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said. `` We're talking about a large volume of material here that needs careful examination.''

The commission normally meets twice a year.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it will ship a 55-ton drilling rig to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> within the next two weeks as part of a program between the two countries to monitor each other's nuclear tests. DOE spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> says a shaft drilled by Soviet technicians at the Soviet test site does not meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requirements. He said Wednesday the Soviets have agreed to allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to drill its own shaft. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is testing a monitoring system called CORRTEX at the Soviet site. That system requires that a shaft be drilled alongside the shaft containing the nuclear weapon. The CORRTEX shaft contains monitoring equipment to determine the size of the blast. The Soviets have indicated they will use seismic equipment in monitoring a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> test. The two sides are scheduled to monitor each other's tests sometime this summer. Nearly two dozen American scientists, most of them from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, are at the Soviet test site making preparations to monitor the Soviet blast. Seven Soviet scientists are at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site, 65 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, observing preparations for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> test. The DOE shipped 45 tons of monitoring equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> aboard a giant C-5B aircraft two weeks ago.

 Alcohol and history apparently do n't mix in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>. Bowing to outcries from local restaurateurs and a descendant of Pilgrims, town officials have rejected a request to serve liquor at the Plimoth Plantation historical site. `` I can hardly see how a pina colada goes with a 17th-century dinner. My forefathers would have jumped over in their graves,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Howland </PERSON>, a descendant of Pilgrims, before selectmen Tuesday unanimously turned down the bid to serve alcohol at the 200-seat restaurant opened in October. Several restaurant owners told the board that approval of the liquor license request would draw away patrons and clash with the historical atmosphere of Plimoth Plantation, a re-creation of the Pilgrim's early 17th-century settlement. `` They come in here under the guise of being a historical and educational enterprise, and they want to have liquor and compete with us,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, whose wife owns the 1620 Restaurant in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>. But Plimoth Plantation director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON> said a liquor license would help attract conventions and large functions at a time when government aid for museums is dwindling. `` This is one of the few resources we have to pay the freight,'' said Case. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>, the plantation's assistant director, said the restaurant will continue to operate without a liquor license but may later apply for a permit to serve beer and wine.

<TEXT>
 Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> is favored to defeat four opponents, including an ex-Ku <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansman </PERSON>, in Tuesday's Democratic gubernatorial primary but faces a tough battle to unseat popular Republican Gov <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> this fall. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, hoping to become the first Republican governor of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> this century to serve consecutive terms, is unopposed for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. Turnout likely will be lower than normal because of the absence of a closely contested gubernatorial primary and because <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> had a separate presidential primary March 8 as part of Super Tuesday, observers say. The candidates have campaigned vigorously but the public seems to have paid little attention. In several polls, more than 50 percent of those surveyed did not know enough about the contenders for lieutenant governor to choose a favorite. The biggest draw Tuesday could be the race for lieutenant governor. With <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> forgoing a re-election bid to challenge <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, five Democrats and three Republicans are running for the state's second-ranking office. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s four opponents include <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a service-station employee not related to the governor; <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, an anti-nuclear activist from <LOCATION> Sylva </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ulla </LOCATION>, who said he quit the Klan in 1987 but remains sympathetic to some of its causes; and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>. All are political unknowns and none has waged a visible campaign. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has urged his supporters not to be complacent. `` Strange things can happen when turnout is low,'' he said. `` This is an opportunity to test our organization.'' But his campaign activities have been geared toward the general election. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has put forward major policy initiatives on economic development and school dropout prevention, including a controversial plan to withhold driver's licenses from minors who quit school. He has attacked <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> as a governor who has done little of substance and has tried to take credit for Democrats' accomplishments `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> does n't need a governor who is content to be a passenger or a back-seat driver,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said in January after driving an 18-wheel truck from his family lumberyard in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gilead </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> to dramatize his `` hands-on'' management style. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a former six-term congressman and <ORGANIZATION> Davidson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> chemistry professor, has pointed to glowing economic statistics during his term and questioned <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s leadership skills. `` In my first three years, over 300,000 new jobs have come into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ jobs from poultry to high tech,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said in a campaign television commercial aired in March. Newspaper polls since January have shown <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> with leads ranging from 16 to 30 percentage points. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> has questioned those findings and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> says the race will tighten as <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s name recognition improves <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> committed what observers called a potentially serious gaffe in March, telling black newspaper executives he agreed with them on some issues that he would n't discuss publicly because he could not win `` without the white redneck vote in eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> described the remark as `` something <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> the Greek might say,'' a reference to the former television sports commentator fired after making controversial remarks about black athletes. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said he had n't meant to be derogatory and considered himself a redneck.

 Strikes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> pose a new challenge to <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> just as he seeks to ease East-West tension by declaring that he will withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and loosen controls in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is counting on better relations with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to give him breathing space for badly needed economic reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A new Polish crisis would pose a dilemma for him. If <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is perceived in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as backing violent suppression of strikes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, it could spoil the mood at the summit meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on May 29-June 2. If unrest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> gets out of hand, as it did in 1956, 1968, 1970, 1976 and 1980-81, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may come under renewed pressure from <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> hardliners who oppose his efforts to ease international tensions and carry out economic reforms at home. `` The last thing that the Soviets want, particularly as they withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, is the specter of national revolt in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. It could cast them as imperial,'' said <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bugajski </PERSON>, an expert on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Polish unrest is not yet as serious as the demonstrations that wracked Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> earlier this year, said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst. And the situation is not as serious as it was in August 1980, when nationwide strikes forced <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist authorities to bargain with the independent Solidarity trade union But `` the situation is really developing pretty fast,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. And the Polish government spokesman, <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, said he would not be surprised if the labor unrest spreads. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has not publicly commented on the latest Polish unrest, although historically it has been an explosive issue for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He reacted harshly to the military crackdown in 1981, imposing economic sanctions. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took the sanctions off after <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist authorities released political prisoners in 1986, and this spring the two nations exchanged ambassadors for the first time since martial law. The Polish leader, Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, has been trying to carry his own brand of economic reforms, including reduced subsidies on food and other necessities. But the reforms were economically painful for a nation which for a decade has suffered shortages of meat and other necessities. The workers responded with wage demands, and in some cases where those demands were not met, with strikes. Solidarity, although outlawed since October 1982, still exists as a nationwide organization, with regional and factory chapters. <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the Solidarity chairman, issued a statement Wednesday urging Poles to `` put pressure on the authorities'' and called for the restoration of his union's legal status. So far, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> has balked at restoring Solidarity or other opposition demands. It was <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, a Soviet-trained career military officer, who crushed Solidarity in the most recent demonstration of the so-called `` <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> doctrine.'' That policy, named after the late Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, held that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would intervene with force if a client state showed signs of abandoning socialism. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> hinted last year that he was backing away from the doctrine, and issued a statement in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> on March 18 saying that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European nations are free to follow `` any paths to socialism.'' His statements are viewed as part of a wider <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> campaign to reduce tensions with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, a step which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysts view as a necessary prerequisite to diverting resources from the military to the civilian sector. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> apparently has the upper hand over more conservative members of his own Politburo, led by <PERSON> Egor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>. But unrest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> could tip the balance and imperil the reforms. In 1956, reforms by <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> promoted revolts in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which in turn led to an unsuccessful attempt to depose him in 1957. Kremlin conservatives managed to dump <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> seven years later, and halted his fight against the legacy of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, a battle which is at the center of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s own reform drive. The Poles, too, are students of history, and they can be expected to take to the streets in large numbers next week to celebrate May 1, the international workers' day, and May 3, the anniversary of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s constitution of 1791. Solidarity and its backers traditionally use those anniversaries to stage massive demonstrations of opposition to the communist government.

 CBS, citing the writers strike and the possibility of a strike by craft workers, said today it would postpone the opening of its fall television season until at least the end of October. CBS, third in the Nielsen ratings for the first time in its history, had planned to begin new fall programming on Sept. 5. That would have given it an earlier start than <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which took first place in the season just completed, and second-place <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. Notice of the postponement was sent to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliate stations by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> -LRB- president of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- stated today that, given the continuing strike by the Writer's <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the uncertainty over the <ORGANIZATION> IATSE </ORGANIZATION> @ Teamsters negotiations in the film industry this summer, the previously announced Sept. 5 start date for the 1988-89 season is no longer feasible,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said in the statement. `` We are looking forward to a new season start date at the end of October 1988. Further details and an exact start date will be forthcoming,'' the statement said. The writers struck the film and television industry on March 7. There are no negotiations at this time. <ORGANIZATION> IATSE </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employes </ORGANIZATION>, represents the various crafts in the film industry, from stage hands to cameramen to makeup artists. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will not announce its fall season start date until it reveals its new schedule on May 23, said a network spokesman. <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, said during a news conference on April 18 that he did not know when the season would begin. `` Our schedule is okay so far,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON>. `` But it will all depend on how long the strike lasts. We will announce our fall schedule on May 18.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has an advantage because it will telecast the Summer Olympics from <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from Sept. 16 to Oct. 3. It will also telecast the World Series in late October. <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, has said that for all intents and purposes <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> would not begin its fall schedule until after the World Series. A strike by movie and television actors in 1980 caused a delay in the opening of that year's television season for all three networks.

 The bullet that killed a police sergeant during a drug raid came from another officer's gun and was not fired by the pregnant woman who initially had been accused, a police source said today. The woman was wounded during the shooting Wednesday, went into labor and gave birth to a daughter, officials said. Police originally said the woman had killed Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> while trying to shoot her way out of a cocaine den, but the police source, who declined to be identified, said `` ballistic tests indicate that the type of gun fired was not consistent with her gun, but consistent with ours.'' The source said the ballistic tests were conducted on a bullet that was retrieved during an autopsy on <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>. Wednesday's slaying was the third drug-related killing of a police officer in two months and had prompted renewed calls from Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> for the death penalty for cop killers. `` She shot a cop. She knew she was shooting at a cop. And she killed a cop. As far as I'm concerned, she should be taken out and executed. I do n't care whether it's a deterrent. ... Kill them all and let God sort them out,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, 43, of the <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, was shot once in the face while serving a search warrant at an upper <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment where police believed 4 -LCB- pounds of cocaine was being held, said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. Mercedes Perez, the woman accused of shooting him, was shot twice and taken to the same hospital, where it was discovered she was eight months pregnant. She went into labor and delivered a 5-pound, 1-ounce girl, authorities said. Mother and daughter were in satisfactory condition, offiials said. Police raiders at the apartment where Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> lived found scales, four vials of crack, one marijuana cigarette, a half ounce of white powder believed to be cocaine, $ 2,000 cash, and a pit bull terrier in the kitchen, authorities said. According to the account given by the police source, two other police officers were in a back bedroom struggling with Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> when her gun went off. They exchanged gunfire with her and one of those bullets struck <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, the source said. On April 13, <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> police officer <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, 27, was shot to death while searching for a missing child in a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> housing project. It is believed that he inadvertently interrupted a drug dispute. On Feb. 26, city policeman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was killed while he sat in his cruiser guarding the home of a witness in a narcotics case in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. Last year, four police officers were killed in the line of duty and seven were injured. The officer who died Wednesday was the first police sergeant to die in the line of duty in 13 years.

Many of the refugees who walk up to four months to reach the camps carry little or no food, and they barely are surviving when they arrive, said <PERSON> Wairimu </PERSON> <PERSON> Karago </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees representative in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. `` When they come in the camps they're not even able to stand,'' said <PERSON> Ayodele </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> desk in the commission's office in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> `` They're walking skeletons.'' The commission estimates 20 percent of the refugees die en route. `` Only the strongest survive the trip,'' said Miss <LOCATION> Karago </LOCATION>. Hundreds more die in the camps, but the death rate is down to about one third of its peak of three deaths per every 10,000 people per day of several months ago when emergency supplies could not meet the sudden influx. The camps are in a remote area of western <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. All but one are accessible by road, but it takes trucks carrying relief supplies six days to make the trip from the northeastern <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION>. Although Miss <PERSON> Karago </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> group tried to call attention to the crisis last year, it was overshadowed by a massive drought relief effort aimed at saving the lives of 7 million starvation-threatened people. The situation is complicated by <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s preoccupation with a civil war in the north, which has crippled relief operations. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said there is a critical need for more trucks to carry food and suplies to the camps. The refugees' basic food needs, mostly in the form of grain, would largely be covered by a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> donation of $ 8 million in grain announced Wednesday, he said. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> appealed for another 32,000 metric tons of supplemental and therapeutic food. Many of the refugees eat nothing but acacia tree leaves during their treks. A Western diplomat who visited the <LOCATION> Itang </LOCATION> and Fugnido camps in March said some of the worst-off refugees `` compared poorly with pictures of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> concentration camp victims and were as bad or worse as anything seen in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> during the 1984-86 famine.'' Tubercular coughs sounded throughout <PERSON> Fugnido </PERSON>'s in-patient medical unit where four or five of the refugees `` looked as if they would not survive the day, and only one was observed moving slowly crawling in his naked state towards a water jug,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Since November, 8,000 to 10,000 refugees have been arriving each month and swelling populations at a camp in <LOCATION> Itang </LOCATION> and forcing the creation of camps at <LOCATION> Dimma </LOCATION>, Fugnido, and <PERSON> Assosa </PERSON>. The refugees are primarily 10 - to 15-year old <PERSON> Dinka </PERSON> and Nuer tribesmen who say they are fleeing conscription and atrocities in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> where mainly Christian and animist rebels are fighting the Moslem government Their most common tale is of government troops entering villages and killing the men and boys and raping the women and girls before taking them for sale into slavery, according to officials who have visited the camps. The young women and boys arriving at the camps either have escaped the attack or fled before the onslaught. The current movement of displaced Sudanese into <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> bagan in 1983 when the rebels took up arms against the government following the collapse of a peace agreement. However, people have been fleeing periodic conflicts in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> since the 1950s.

 <PERSON> Althea </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, the first black American tennis champion, Thursday presented her five Wimbledon trophies to the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION>. `` Who could have imagined? Who could have thought?'' the 60-year-old <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said at Smithsonian ceremony. `` Here stands before you a Negro woman, raised in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, who went on to become a tennis player ... and finally wind up being a world champion, in fact, the first black woman champion of this world. `` And believe it or not, I still am,'' she said. The eldest of five children, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> described herself as `` a born athlete,'' noting her 200 bowling average and membership in the Mysterious Five girls' basketball team before she met <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the one-armed tennis coach who taught her to play. Among those attending the presentation was Dr. E.A. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, who with another black physician decided to prepare the gangly, 17-year-old <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> teen for the world of tennis whites and rackets. `` She was a fine player but she had too many rough edges to go into those tennis clubs,'' <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> remembered. `` So my friend said if I would send her to school, he would take her to the tournaments. A few months later, <PERSON> Althea </PERSON> got off the train in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, with her bag, tennis racket and the saxaphone <PERSON> Suger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> had given her.'' Although <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> was the first black woman to compete in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> championships at <LOCATION> Forrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, in 1950 and at <LOCATION> Wimbledon </LOCATION> in 1951, it was not until 1956 that she began to win major tennis tournaments throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including the women's doubles championship at <LOCATION> Wimbledon </LOCATION>. For the next two years <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> captured both the singles and doubles championships at <LOCATION> Wimbledon </LOCATION>, causing her to be voted the Woman Athlete of the Year for 1957 by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. During this period she also was awarded the Banchees Award of Sportsmanship, the Babe Zaharias Award as Woman Athlete of the Year and the Pigskin Club Sterling Athlete Award. Although the trophies will be held in storage, a <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> tennis racket and a tennis dress she used in one of her championship matches were placed on public view immediately. Following her retirement in 1960, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> toured with the <ORGANIZATION> Harlem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globetrotters </ORGANIZATION>, served on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and became a professional golfer.

 <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricupero </PERSON> expressed his unhappiness with town officials by painting his post office building purple, yellow, black and fluorescent red and orange. He also threw in a few pink polka dots. `` I like these colors. These are my favorite colors,'' <PERSON> Ricupero </PERSON> said. Others are not so enamored. Selectman <PERSON> Erving </PERSON> <PERSON> LeCain </PERSON> called it `` one of the stupidest things I've seen in a long time.''

But the town rejected his petition for an addition, saying there was an inadequate setback. The zoning board of adjustment suggested he put the addition in the back. However, after drawing up another plan, <PERSON> Ricupero </PERSON> was again rejected, this time because there was not enough parking. <PERSON> Ricupero </PERSON> said he was rejected because he moved to <LOCATION> Bennington </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> five years ago and is considered a `` flatlander.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, chairman of the zoning board and also a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> native, called <PERSON> Ricupero </PERSON> a `` troublemaker,'' and suggested he hire an engineer to address problems with the plan.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> believes in modern means of delivering his church's message. For more than a month, members of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have been hearing West remind them to attend choir practice and show up for parish meetings. The preaching comes via a telecomputer, a machine programmed to dial phone numbers and deliver <PERSON> West </PERSON>'s message of the day. `` One person ca n't make the calls this machine does in the same time frame,'' <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. `` It takes no breaks for lunch or a drink of water. If somebody hangs up, it does n't get mad.'' On the day before Easter, for example, all 525 church members picked up the ringing phone and heard this: `` Hello, this is Pastor West calling. I trust you're ready for Easter. Do n't forget to turn your clocks up.'' It also gave other information about church services and had room for parishioners to leave a message. West conceded that a taped message sounds impersonal, but said it's a good way to keep in touch with his growing congregation.

<BYLINE>If Iranian Missiles Were't Silkworms, What Were They?
^By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the missiles <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> fired at three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships last week were not Chinese-made Silkworms, but left unanswered a question that puzzles American officers here: If not Silkworms, what were they? Senior naval officers said they were unaware of anything in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s arsenal that might be easily confused with the Silkworm, a dangerous but fairly primitive weapon based on a 30-year-old Soviet design. `` If they have something new and different, you would expect it to be better,'' one said, noting that the projectiles were thwarted with relative ease by the warships' anti-missile defenses. Four fell into the water and the fifth was seen to hit an oil platform. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> deployed mobile Silkworm batteries along its shore of the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> about a year ago. It threatened to fire them at ships in the narrow gateway to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, but never had rom warships or aircraft. One clue being examined was an Iranian C-130 aircraft that was airborne at the time. American officers suspect it reported locations of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships to missile batteries. Some diplomats and officers said they believed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would play down or deny the firing of Silkworms to avoid the need for retaliation that might escalate conflict in the gulf, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. `` That's what I think and that's what a lot of other people think,'' a Western diplomat said. He noted a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warning to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last year that even an indication of `` hostile intent'' would draw swift response. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials including <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, said such intent would include using the missile batteries' fire-control radar to track <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships or other U.S.-flagged vessels passing through Hormuz. Some Arab leaders are understood to believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, having dealt a severe blow to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s naval forces in the clashes April 18, wants to avoid further armed conflict. American forces attacked two Iranian oil platforms and sank or disabled six naval craft that day in raids described as a `` measured response'' to hostile acts, including the mining of gulf waters and firing on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters. In the course of `` Operation Praying Mantis,'' as the retaliatory raids were called, the guided missile frigate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, destroyer <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> and guided missile destroyer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> came under missile attack near the strait. They took evasive action and fired `` chaff'' rockets to confuse the radar-guidance systems of the incoming projectiles, all of which flew wide. One missile was seen by crewmen on the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> fantail as it crossed behind the ship and hit a distant oil platform. It passed close enough that a helicopter pilot dived into a net for safety and a crewman fired at it with an M-60 machine gun. Officers of the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> identified the missiles as Silkworms, but <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday they concluded from `` strong indicators'' that they were not. They said the inquiry was continuing. Officials did not describe the `` indicators,'' but one said known Silkworm sites and a storage area at the <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> naval base were under `` constant surveillance'' and `` if they had moved one out, we would have seen it.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Manama </LOCATION> said he could not comment on the Pentagon findings. `` That gets into an area we ca n't discuss here,'' he said. The report from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was no surprise to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers in the gulf. Some had said they were stunned and mystified by the efforts of officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, within hours, to debunk the reports of Silkworms. `` Everything we know says that's what they were,'' a senior officer said at the time. Another declared angrily: `` I know Silkworms were fired just as well as I know my own name.'' After hearing that Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted by a congressman _ misquoted, it turned out _ as denying the missiles were Silkworms, one officer pointed to the rank on his collar and laughed. `` See that?'' he said. `` Do you think I'm going to argue?'' Capt. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>, commander of <ORGANIZATION> Surface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, the three-ship unit led by the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, was asked again the day after the missile was fired what kind he thought it was. `` I do n't know,'' he said with a shrug. `` All I know is, it was big, it was fast and it came from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Outcry Against Gun Law Follows Shooting of Third Miami Cop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The shooting of three <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> policeman in a month, along with a skyrocketing murder rate, had authorities here demanding a change in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s liberal gun law Thursday, and the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> appears to be responding. Only hours after <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> motorcycle patrolman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> was wounded twice with an automatic pistol during a routine traffic stop, a state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> criminal justice subcommittee voted 4-3 Thursday to recommend an amendment to the state constitution to require a seven-day cooling-off period for gun buyers. On Wednesday, the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had approved another bill that tightened up gun law loopholes allowing some convicted criminals to get concealed weapons permits. The current relaxed gun law, approved last year over the protests of urban police agencies, all but eliminated cooling-off periods, banned local gun control ordinances and allowed most Floridians to carry a concealed weapon. Opponents, including Miami-area police and city officials, say it encourages a Wild West atmosphere they blame for a surge in violence. `` You liberalize gun laws and people feel they are at liberty to go out and shoot each other and shoot policemen,'' an angry <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON> said Thursday. `` We're headed the wrong way.'' <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> had an 18 percent increase in gun-related crimes between October and March, compared with the same period before the law was passed. And ominously, gun thefts were up 30 percent, said <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON>. The murder rate in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, after having dropped last year, has soared again, hitting the 100 mark in April _ four months ahead of the 1987 rate. `` We're going to have to see a lot more people killed and maybe a lot more policemen killed before the Legislature makes a change,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hidalgo-Gato </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> on Thursday called for a new law or a state constitutional amendment giving local communities the right to regulate guns. `` We need extensive background checks and a cooling-off period,'' said <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>. Under the current state law, counties can impose a limited two-day cooling-off period, but police say it's so vague that it's meaningless. Wednesday night's wounding of <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, who was listed in stable condition Thursday, occurred in the same neighborhood where veteran police officer <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON> was shot to death March 30 after stopping a car. There have been no arrests in either shooting. The same day <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON> was killed, a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> trooper was wounded on Interstate 95 in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and killed his attacker. On April 5, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> undercover police officer was grazed in the head by a gunman later identified as an escaped prisoner. If the bill passed Thursday by the criminal justice subcommittee is later approved by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the question will be put to voters on the November statewide ballot. The measure would not need approval by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> to be placed on the ballot. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, sponsored the proposed constitutional amendment because he said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s image has been tarnished by the gun law. `` I've traveled across this county,'' said Silver. `` No longer are people asking us about the sun, beaches and weather ... but they are talking about ` What are you doing about the gun situation in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>?''' <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, a lobbyist for the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> arm of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>'s bill was prompted more by emotionalism than by a need to protect public safety. `` Waiting periods have nothing to do with fun and sun in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, director of the Unified Sportsmen of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Police concede that none of the recent police shootings and few other gun-related slayings can be tied directly to last year's gun law. But they contend the law has put more guns on the street and created a mentality that makes using a gun more acceptable.

<TEXT>
 Democratic leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> urged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Thursday to reverse course and sign a sweeping trade bill, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said flatly that he will veto it. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s opposition to the bill centers on a provision requiring companies to give workers 60 days' notice of plant closings or major layoffs, and he offered his labor-leader background as a reason. `` As an old labor union president, I suggest that's a matter that belongs in the management-labor contracts between the unions and the people,'' the president told reporters as he greeted Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> for lunch. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> served as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> from 1947 to 1952 and in 1959. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president's veto message would `` clearly indicate'' what would be acceptable to the administration in a replacement bill. `` We would hope then to be able to work with the leadership, come up with a bill as rapidly as possible that everyone could support and pass,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should sign the existing bill and suggested there might not be enough time to produce another measure. `` This bill is n't dead yet,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, told reporters on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> `` The ball is in the White House court. If there is a demise of this bill it will occur at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, not here.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has only about 90 legislative days left this year and a heavy schedule. Asked if it would accept changes drafted by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` We're not spoon-fed from the White House.'' `` I hope the president will rethink his position and come down on the side of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. Also pleading for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign the bill, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said, `` There has to be a warm side to the president. I ca n't believe it falls on deaf ears or a flinty heart.'' The measure, the product of three years of congressional work, won final approval on a 63-36 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote Wednesday, but the total fell short of the two-thirds margin needed to override a veto. Besides the plant-closing provision, the lengthy bill would increase the power of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative to act against other countries that use unfair trade practices, make it easier to curb imports, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies, and increase agricultural subsidies. The Japanese and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> governments urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto the measure, saying it would hinder international trade. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> warned of retaliatory action if the bill became law. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the bill is not expected to reach the Oval Office until the middle of next week, after which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will have 10 days in which to act. `` In the veto message the president will lay out his generic concerns about the bill, undoubtedly will specify that we would like to see plant closings eliminated from future consideration of a bill,'' the spokesman said. `` He will have a message that will ... pretty clearly indicate what would be acceptable to the administration and use that as a framework for then discussing a new bill with the leadership'' of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. While the plant-closing provision had been the most objectionable feature to the administration, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had other problems with it. He refused to spell out what other changes the administration would demand to make the bill acceptable, however. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said, `` There are a lot of good things in that legislation, so if a couple of necessary corrections are made and the bill comes back, I'm really quite confident the president would sign it.''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> narrowly won <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s presidential caucuses, according to official <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> figures released Thursday <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> edged <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by winning 596 of the state convention delegates elected at local caucuses last week. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won 582 delegates, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> won six and 120 were elected uncommitted. The percentages were 46 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to 45 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, the executive director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the official tabulation had been slowed by mistakes found in some community caucuses. An unofficial <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count on the night of the caucuses had <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ahead, 589 delegates to 581 for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The 1,304 delegates elected April 19 will attend the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> convention next month at which time 14 of the state's 19 delegates to the national convention will be elected. The remaining five spots belong to Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter, and four party officials. It is not sure how the 14 will be split since the vote at the state convention is by secret ballot. `` Fifty people going one way or the other could make a real difference in whether it is 7-7 or 9-5,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Squires </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brattleboro </LOCATION>, the vice chair of the party. <PERSON> Squires </PERSON>, one of the four party officials automatically a delegate to the national convention, remains committed to Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, though he said Thursday that `` outside of that commitment, the message <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been delivering is the one I am most comfortable with.'' The other three party officials going to the national convention are state party chair Violet Coffin, who is officially uncommitted but listed by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign as a likely supporter; state committeeman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnahan </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter, and <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> David-Freidman </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter. `` In <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, more than in any other state, white people did not hesitate to vote for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> state coordinator, said Thursday after the official caucus results were released. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had won <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s non-binding presidential primary on March 1, taking 56 percent of the vote, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gained 26 percent. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> coordinator, said of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s forces in the caucuses, `` They organized in the smallest of communities, as well as the larger ones That showed real persistence, real dedication to detail.''

<HEAD>Bid To Topple Opposition Leader Bumps Mulroney From Headlines</HEAD>

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> must be wondering what he has to do to grab a headline. His <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit took second-billing at home Thursday to a dramatic rebellion in the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. While <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> was urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to curb acid rain in a speech Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> termed the best he'd heard from a foreign leader, newscasts in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> led with <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s fight for survival A silver-haired lawyer who took over from former Prime Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> in 1984 but has never had wholehearted support, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> emerged Wednesday from a day-long battle with detractors to reject demands for his resignation. A group of 22 of the party's 39 members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> had urged him to step down as the country heads into an election campaign. `` I will stay as long as it takes to become prime minister,'' said a defiant <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, 58. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, a Progressive Conservative, may have been miffed at coming second on the news, but the outcome of the Liberal squabble could help him in the election he must call in the next year. Polls indicate that former <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> cabinet member <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON>, waiting in the Liberal wings, is twice as popular as Turner. The Conservatives, Liberals and socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are running neck-and-neck in the polls, with <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s party on the upswing. There was more political turmoil in the headlines from <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, where the country's only socialist government was resoundingly defeated Tuesday but none of the three main parties won a majority. The Conservatives, led by premier-elect <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Filmon </PERSON>, took 25 of the 57 seats in the provincial legislature and will form a minority government May 9. But <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s party had hoped for a more convincing win to start a national trend, and the big winners Tuesday were the Liberals who took 20 seats and hold the balance of power. Liberal leader <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Carstairs </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION> teacher, became the only woman opposition leader in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and is poised to become the country's first woman premier if the Conservatives falter. The result appeared to doom one of the biggest achievements of <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s first term: the <LOCATION> Meech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> constitutional accord he negotiated with all 10 provinces last year. The accord would bring <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> back into the constitutional fold, ending a seven-year boycott, by recognizing the French-majority province as a `` distinct society.'' But <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> paid a price for that historic clause. He agreed to decentralize federal powers, giving the provinces more say over spending programs and appointments to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Without consulting all party factions, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> endorsed the accord. But many leading Liberals oppose it, including <PERSON> Carstairs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>, who emerged from retirement to argue passionately that it could fracture the nation. Last year, 11 <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers defied <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and voted against the accord in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Last week, the Liberal-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> refused to ratify the measure and sent it back to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> with nine amendments. The accord also requires ratification by all provinces, and so far only three have done so. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> is firmly against it, and <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> premier-elect <PERSON> Filmon </PERSON> lacks the votes to push it through. `` In essence, <ORGANIZATION> Meech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> is dead,'' said <PERSON> Carstairs </PERSON>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> withstood a similar political ambush in 1986, emerging with a 76 percent approval rating from a national convention, but the unrest surfaced against last summer and this year. He told reporters his mandate came from the entire party, not just members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and he intends to fulfil it. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Finestone </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker from <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, termed the resentment against <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> a `` festering sore'' that had to be thrashed out, but she hoped members would now rally behind him. However, there was speculation that some of the rebels who are upset over <ORGANIZATION> Meech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> and the party's $ 4 million debt may quit the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> caucus to sit in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> as independents. `` Obviously, it will be very dificult to work together,'' said one dissident, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunziata </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Defections could endanger <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s position as official opposition leader since the Liberals have 39 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the New Democrats 33. If seven Liberals resign, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> would take over Turner's role.

 When <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Germano </PERSON> was trapped in his burning car on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> highway, private detective <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvine </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and two other men risked death as they reached inside to pull him to safety moments before the car exploded. `` It was natural instinct. We saw him ... in danger and we automatically went to try to get him out,'' <PERSON> Alvine </PERSON> recalled Thursday. The act of heroism won <PERSON> Alvine </PERSON>, his fellow rescuers and 16 other Americans and Canadians recognition Thursday from the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Three men died in the performance of their heroism. <PERSON> Alvine </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caldwell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was driving shortly before 1 a.m. Nov. 7, 1987, when he and other motorists saw a three-car accident. <PERSON> Germano </PERSON>, 23, was left unconscious in the driver's seat of his car. `` <PERSON> Germano </PERSON>'s car erupted into flames. As I got to his car, another guy helped me get the door open. Believe me, it was really hot. We could n't pull him out because of his seat belt,'' <PERSON> Alvine </PERSON> said. `` A guy who had a knife came in and cut the seat belt off and then we crawled into the car and pulled him out and dragged him away. As soon as we got him out of there, the car blew up again. It was just ashes when it was all over.'' <PERSON> Alvine </PERSON> was helped by motorists <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogert </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Palecek </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who also were honored as heroes. The <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which honors heroes periodically, awards a medal and $ 2,500 to those it recognizes. It has honored 37 people thus far this year and 7,218 people since it was founded in 1904 by industrialist <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> to honor heroism by civilians in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>New York Appears to Have Ridden Out the Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAYNER PIKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The October stock market crash threw 7,000 people out of work on Wall Street, but the rest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s job-generating economy largely continues to boom, according to figures released Thursday Unemployment in the city reached an 18-year low at 4.7 percent in the first quarter of the year, said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON>, regional commissioner of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. The national unemployment rate for the quarter was 6.2 percent. The improvement in the city showed up across the board, with joblessness down not only among white men, but also among blacks, Hispanics, women and teen-agers. None of these figures, however, declined to the levels of 1968, when city unemployment was only 3.1 percent. `` It is clear that concerns about imminent and substantial economic decline following last October's crash have not become reality,'' <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON> said in a statement. Some experts had predicted the city would lose as many as 50,000 jobs in its financial services sector. Although Wall Street has lost 7,000 jobs in the six months since October, in the two years before that it had added 30,000 jobs to reach an all-time high of 160,000 people working in the financial district. Also since October, another 4,000 jobs were lost in the ever-declining manufacturing field. But overall, since the October crash, private-sector jobs were up by 10,000, thanks mainly to an addition of 14,000 service industry jobs and 5,300 jobs in construction, <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Tells Congress Jordan May Accept Mideast Proposal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that `` under the right circumstances'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> would accept his proposal for a limited <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace conference. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he failed to enlist the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during his talks last week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and that the peace conference remains the `` centerpiece'' of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s objections to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for negotiations `` I did n't achieve any breakthrough,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee that is considering the administration's request for $ 3.8 billion to operate the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and international organizations in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had hoped to open Arab-Israeli negotiations next Sunday. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would serve as `` sponsors'' for direct talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a mixed delegation of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and Palestinian Arabs. So far, only <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, who is not directly involved, has publicly supported the proposal. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said `` under the right circumstances such a conference would be agreeable to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>.'' He acknowledged, however, that `` they have n't said so in so many words.'' King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> has insisted on superpower participation in <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> negotiations, while <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> wants to exclude the Soviets for an active role. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> seeks international backing for any deal he may make with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is skeptical that the Soviets, who usually back Arab positions, would play a helpful role in reaching a settlement. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> stressed his goal was direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arabs. However, he said `` down the road'' the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the three other permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> would deal with questions of international guarantees and refugees. These are issues `` international groupings deal with best,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan calls for two stages of negotiations. In the first, arrangements would be made to provide some self-rule for three years for the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> gaza </LOCATION>. In the second stage, beginning Dec. 1, negotiations would be held on the 40-year <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> could then join the discussion. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was near a decision on whether to expand the protection of American warships to neutral shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is already guiding <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers, flying the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, through the troubled waters and has clashed with Iranian forces there. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was returning Thursday night from a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. `` The president will decide fairly soon,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Critics have expressed concern the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is being drawn into the war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., on Thursday offered an amendment to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill to exclude the use of <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels from duty in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, as the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has recommended Pepper contended the vessels were needed to intercept drug traffic closer to home.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s presidential campaign was given additional time Thursday to submit financial records in a federal investigation of the tax-exempt status of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s religious broadcasting network <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> extended a show-cause order for two weeks, until May 12, for documents originally requested by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> last December. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Americans For <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, the group's former treasurer, have turned over most of the information requested. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has asked for additional materials, including bank records for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> groups in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, attorney for Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, said the records would be available within five days. `` We have not opposed any of the requests and have made records available as quickly as possible,'' he said in asking for a continuance of the order filed late last month. In addition to financial data, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> asked for copies of fund-raising letters and `` records of any transactions with the <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a former television evangelist from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, founded the non-profit, tax-exempt <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> and was its president until last October, when he announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. The cable network's operations were turned over to one of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s sons. The Freedom Council, established in 1981 with seed money from <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION>, received nearly $ 3 million from the network in 1985, according to former council officials. That was the year <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> began setting up his political organization. In papers filed with the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> seeking tax-exempt status, the <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said it was created to educate Christians on how to get involved in politics. Critics contend the council acted as a front for the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> campaign by organizing political neophytes from fundamentalist or charismatic churches as <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> volunteers. The <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> disbanded in 1986 shortly after Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was formed. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slosser </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, headed the council at the time, and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON>, Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s initial acting director and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign manager through most of the primaries, served as a paid council consultant. Under federal law, tax-exempt entities can not raise money for or support political candidates. The loss of tax-exempt status would mean contributors could not deduct their donations from income taxes.

<HEAD>Education Group Urges Schools To Return to Teaching Moral Values</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An educators' group on Thursday urged schools to take a more active role in teaching students right from wrong, saying recent increases in teen-age suicides, drug abuse and pregnancies show the need for common-sense moral values. The Association for Supervision and <ORGANIZATION> Curriculum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said in a 47-page report that too many schools have shied away from teaching moral values for fear of offending students. But, the group contended, there are some common values, like honesty, compassion and altruism, that all Americans believe in, no matter what their religious beliefs. `` There's a great deal of concern across the country about the morality of adults, from the insider trading scandal on Wall Street to the Iran-Contra affair,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, executive editor of the association's publications. `` There's obviously a good deal of lying and cheating going on in our society, and students are picking up on that.'' <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> added, `` We do n't mean to imply that the schools have a total responsibility for teaching moral values, but they do play a role.'' The association, founded 45 years ago, is a group of teachers, principals and school administrators involved in writing school curricula and deciding what gets taught. It estimates it has 100,000 members. Its report, `` Moral Education in the Life of the School,'' said concern about moral education has been triggered in the past few years by `` the substantial, long-term increase in emotional problems among young Americans'' and cites dramatic rises in the rates of murders and suicides among young men, increases in the rate of out-of-wedlock births to adolescents and higher rates of teen-age drug use. `` These data indicate that, by some measures at least, young people show more self-destructive and other destructive behavior today than they did two or three decades ago,'' the report said. At the same time, the report said, educators grew more `` wary of even trying to identify common moral values.'' But educators may have gone too far in avoiding controversy, the report said. It said recent Gallup polls have shown that the American public rates drug use and lack of discipline as the two top problems facing the public schools. `` Evidently, the public wants some moral education,'' association executive director <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cawelti </PERSON> said. `` And with family breakups, the schools are the last remaining place with moral influence.'' The report suggested that schools ask parents, local business leaders and religious and ethnic groups to help put together a list of values that should be taught in the schools. It provided one list, put together by the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, schools that included values like courtesy, equality of opportunity, loyalty, compassion, patriotism and truth. `` Values like these constitute our democracy's moral heritage,'' the report said. `` In most communities, substantial majorities can be mobilized to support statements of principle that include similar values.'' <PERSON> Cawelti </PERSON> said that those values then can be taught through community service projects and even in history and literature classes, `` where there are themes through the ages of moral and immoral behavior.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed a multibillion-dollar education measure expanding services to students Thursday, but expressed regret that `` current <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jurisprudence'' is hostile to provisions outlawing pornographic telephone messages. In a signing ceremony attended by the bill's sponsors and supporters in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the measure `` reauthorizes and improves a wide variety of federal programs at the elementary and secondary school level.'' `` At the same time, it recognizes a fundamental truth: that the primary responsibility for educating these children lies with the local communities and the states and not with the federal government,'' he said. Noting the ban on telephone pornography, the president said, `` I commend <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for joining the administration's long-standing effort to combat hard core obscenity.'' `` I am bound to note, however, as much as it displeases me, that current <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jurisprudence is unfriendly to parts of this bill,'' he said. `` And I hope that the courts and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will work with the administration to do as much as is permitted by the Constitution to enforce the provisions of this statute.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> opposed the ban on telephone pornography, saying that, although born of concern for children, it intrudes on the privacy and free speech rights of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adults. `` No court has ever upheld a complete ban on non-obscene, so-called ` indecent' speech,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, legislative counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, said after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage of the measure. The signing ceremony was attended by Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., and Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt., the principal sponsors of the bill, and by <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in both houses who joined them in The act authorizes up to $ 8.3 billion in spending next year on elementary and secondary school programs, with more than half the money going to disadvantaged children at risk of failing. It contains new programs to prevent dropouts and help high school students with weak skills, and greatly expands drug abuse education and magnet schools. New money also was earmarked for math, science and foreign-language programs. The bill, a compromise between the versions passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, was approved by voice vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and by a vote of 397-1 in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, with Rep. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, R-Ind., voting against it The largest single program in the measure will pay for tutoring and other services to disadvantaged children who are in danger of failing academically. School districts could receive basic grants totaling up to $ 4.7 billion in the 12 months beginning Oct. 1,, a $ 400 million increase over current spending. Other initiatives in the bill include $ 50 million for `` Even Start,'' to jointly educate poor preschool children and their illiterate parents; $ 50 million for dropout prevention demonstration projects; and $ 200 million to improve basic skills of high school students. `` From the beginning, we worked with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, educators and the public to assure legislation that would assure basic education for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s youth,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

 Bakers and street vendors joined a protest strike Thursday that virtually closed down the occupied territories and <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Israeli army gunfire killed one Palestinian and wounded two. The effectiveness of the strike was at odds with declarations by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities that the 5-month-old rebellion in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> had begun to ebb. Underground Palestinian leaders called the strike in a bulletin issued last week, and it appeared to be as widespread as dozens of others since the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied lands began what even the Israelis now call the `` intefadah'' _ the uprising. Arab reporters said bakers and street vendors, who usually operate during strikes, joined this one in most areas. An army spokesman said troops shot and killed a 20-year-old Arab when they were attacked by hundreds of protesters after entering the village of <LOCATION> Malek </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. The soldiers were apparently going to conduct a search. The spokesman said the troops were attacked with stones and a firebomb and fired in the direction from which the firebomb came, killing the Palestinian. The killing raised the Arab death toll in the rebellion to 175. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> teen-ager and a soldier have also died. In <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, about 100 young Palestinians set tires ablaze in front of the municipal building and shouted for the resignation of Mayor <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Zir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. <PERSON> Zir </PERSON> was appointed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A 20-year-old protestor, <PERSON> Raed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuhkee </PERSON>, was wounded by gunfire when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops dispersed the crowd with tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition, the witnesses said. Dozens of Arabs blocked the road to <LOCATION> Ebween </LOCATION>, a village near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> with rocks and burning tires, then threw stones at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers who arrived in three jeeps, a villager reported. The villager, who would not give his name, said a 23-year-old man was shot. He spoke to a reporter at <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where the victim was being treated for a gunshot wound in the right leg. Army spokesmen confirmed a protester was wounded in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> and another near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, but said they were investigating. Hundreds of Palestinians have been wounded since the violence began Dec. 8. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the army bulldozed an orange grove outside <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> after a jeep skidded off a nearby road on which Palestinians had spread oil. Soldiers followed footprints from the road to the orange grove, the radio said. Reporters who went there later found bulldozer tracks and a half-acre of uprooted orange trees. In south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, just across <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and their Christian militia allies fired flares and conducted searches overnight to try to close the route Palestinian guerrillas used to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Tuesday and Wednesday, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said. Soldiers and militiamen of the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> set up roadblocks and questioned hundreds of Lebanese in the search for collaborators, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The militia is the army's surrogate in the `` security zone'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintain north of the frontier. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Wednesday the two border crossings were an attempt at something spectacular to spur the rebellion in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. They led to firefights in which five guerrillas and two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers died. Predictions of a calming in the territories followed several days of comparatively little violence, and Thursday's strike was generally peaceful. Arabs blocked roads with wrecked cars and stones in several cities in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, and taxi and bus stands were empty in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Witnesses in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said young Palestinians wearing checkered Arab scarves over their faces stopped cars to keep workers from reaching jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, outlawed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, flew in the center of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. Manger Square, usually crowded, was nearly deserted.

<HEAD>Grapefruit Not Poisonous After All, Ministry Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Health officials said Thursday that the blue substance injected into some grapefruit in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> was not poisonous, and they revoked a nationwide ban on sales of the citrus fruit. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had ordered a seizure of all grapefruit in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and triggered an alert in 11 other Common Market countries when they reported Tuesday that they found six grapefruit poisoned in an apparent act of sabotage aimed at Israeli exports. But the ministry said Thursday that lab tests determined the substance was methylene blue, a non-toxic biological stain also used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning. None of the other grapefruit seized was found to be tainted. It was not known whether the six tainted grapefruit actually were from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Authorities found the six tainted fruit in a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> supermarket after a caller warned a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> newspaper that grapefruit there had been poisoned. The caller claimed responsibility for the `` Organization of Metropolitan Proletarians and Oppressed People,'' a group not previously heard of. A poster pasted on the outside of the supermarket urged a boycott of Israeli products. The week before, an organization that said it supported the Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> claimed to have poisoned Israeli grapefruit on sale in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> and called for a boycott of Israeli products. Laboratory checks found no trace of poison. Health Minister <PERSON> Donat </PERSON> <PERSON> Cattin </PERSON> ordered the nationwide seizure when three laboratory mice died after eating blue pulp from some of the grapefruit. But officials began to doubt the grapefruit had been poisoned because all the other rats, mice and guinea pigs used in additional tests on Wednesday survived. Health officials speculated that the first three mice may have died from the fiber in the fruit. `` Grapefruit is not a food for mice,'' said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Adato, an <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> official sent to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to assist in the inquiry.

<HEAD>Inquiry Demanded After Death of Human Rights Activist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Czechoslovak human rights organizations Thursday demanded that <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> open an investigation into the death of imprisoned human rights activist <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>, a 35-year-old auto mechanic, was known to be suffering from intestinal problems and other ailments when he died in a Czech prison on Tuesday, but he was not fatally ill, according to a <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> emigre source. `` We therefore call on the Czechoslovak <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to launch an inquiry into the circumstances of <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>'s death and publish the results of this inquiry,'' said a joint statement issued by the Prague-based <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the Unjustly Prosecuted, known as <ORGANIZATION> VONS </ORGANIZATION>, and the human rights organization Charter 77. The statement was reported in <ORGANIZATION> Palach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a London-based newsletter monitoring human rights in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> VONS </ORGANIZATION> said it was the first time in its 10-year history that it had to report the death of a political prisoner. `` Regardless of the cause of death, it will be necessary to ascertain exactly to what extent the prison authorities and wardens can be held responsible,'' Thursday's statement said. <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON> said the death of <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON> was not explained in a telegram sent to his family by prison authorities in <ORGANIZATION> Hradec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kralove </ORGANIZATION>, a city about 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. The newsletter also demanded that Czech health and justice ministers allow independent doctors to be present at <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>'s autopsy and said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was ready to attend the post-mortem <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>, who was released Feb. 26 after serving a 21-month prison sentence, was to be under `` protective surveillance'' for three years after he was freed.

<HEAD>NATO To Forge Ahead With Nuclear Arms Improvements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers Thursday vowed to upgrade short-range nuclear arms following the accord to ban intermediate-range missiles and an earlier decision to remove 1,400 nuclear warheads from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In related comments, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> called a move in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> to firm up the country's anti-nuclear stance a `` fundamental challenge'' to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s defense strategy. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will not end its `` very firm policy'' of not confirming or denying its warships carry nuclear arms, he said. `` We can not have that policy whittled away at in any way, shape or form,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. The Danish parliament adopted a motion April 14 demanding warships be reminded not to carry nuclear arms each time they visit a Danish port. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s minority center-right government has called for early elections over the issue. British <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, too, will never say if its navy ships are nuclear-armed or not. He and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> spoke after a two-day meeting at which the defense ministers agreed to continue to seek improvements in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is studying how to upgrade short-range nuclear arms after a 1983 decision to remove 1,400 nuclear warheads from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty to remove ground-launched, medium-range missiles. The agreement was signed Dec. 8 by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Some tactical arms are now being modernized, including artillery shells and jets carrying both nuclear and conventional arms, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. On introducing by the mid-1990s new ground-to-ground and air-to-ground missiles, he said, `` There are no particular deployment decisions that need to be addressed at this point.'' But <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will `` proceed at a measured pace'' to improve its nuclear arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> added. In a communique, the defense ministers said, `` For the forseeable future nuclear forces will continue to play an integral role in providing for deterrence ... their presence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is therefore essential.'' It added <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will keep these arms `` up-to-date where necessary.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> briefed the allies on intelligence reports that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> continues to upgrade or redeploy nuclear arms not covered by the INF treaty. Sources said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has deployed more than 4,000 tactical aircraft, 25 to 30 percent of which are nuclear-armed. Also, it is retargeting missiles such as the long-range SS-24s and SS-25s, officials said. The Soviets, <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said, were `` undoubtedly busy keeping their weapons systems up-to-date.'' The ministers called the INF treaty `` a milestone in our efforts to achieve a more secure peace at lower levels of arms.'' They restated their support for superpower efforts to halve their strategic nuclear forces. Hopes have faded that a START treaty can be signed at the May 29-June 2 U.S.-Soviet summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said that given the progress in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> arms control negotiations, the Danish parliament resolution to tighten up the country's anti-nuclear ban came `` at a particularly unfortunate point in time.'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General Lord <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said the motion `` would obviously lead to very great difficulties in the alliance'' if implemented. Danish Defense Minister <PERSON> Bernt </PERSON> <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collet </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ministers that early elections had been called for May 10 to seek `` a political mandate'' for continued, full <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> membership for his country. A poll published Thursday showed that most Danes want to have a nuclear-free zone in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, and nearly half would favor the idea even if it meant leaving <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>FCC Urged To Reverse Revocation Of 14 Radio, TV Licenses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> defended the company's integrity Thursday and urged the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to reverse an initial decision to revoke its 14 radio and television station licenses. Attorney <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> told the three sitting <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> commissioners that an administrative law judge's charge that RKO General has demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty with advertisers as well as the commission is undeserved. Since the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> stripped RKO of its license for <ORGANIZATION> WNAC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in 1980, the company `` has recognized it had made a serious mistake and has been candid with the commission,'' <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> said. The regulatory agency refused to renew RKO's license for the station on grounds that the company had filed false financial statements with the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> and lacked candor in its dealings with the commission. The WNAC proceeding, begun in 1969, and another involving KHJ-TV, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, begun in 1965, ultimately called into question all of <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION>'s radio and TV licenses. In jeopardy are the licenses for broadcast properties the company estimates are worth $ 400 million to $ 500 million. FCC Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quello </PERSON>, in an opening statement before <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON>'s presentation, noted that he had voted with the minority in the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to revoke RKO's license for <ORGANIZATION> WNAC-TV </ORGANIZATION> and called the action `` the harshest and most unwarranted decision in the history of the commission.'' The commission is considering the recommendations of Administrative Law Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhlmann </PERSON>, who in an initial decision last August cited RKO for fraudulent billing practices, overcharging of advertisers and destroying an internal audit report. In characterizing the extent of the alleged improprieties, <PERSON> Kuhlmann </PERSON> said `` no case ever before decided by this commission presents dishonesty comparable to RKO's.'' <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> said `` RKO took misconduct seriously'' and relied on a system of audits and outside controls to assure management that the company, owned by <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, Ohio-based <ORGANIZATION> GenCorp </ORGANIZATION>., and its stations were complying with FCC rules Problems, however, occurred because of `` manipulation and evasion of the system'' by individuals within the company, a consequence for which RKO can not be blamed for negligence, he said. But Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> asked: `` How can there be so much manipulation and evasion of the system that did n't come to the attention of management?'' Attorney <PERSON> Nathanial </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmons </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, one of the companies that challenged <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION>'s fitness to hold a broadcast license, estimated that RKO's <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Networks </ORGANIZATION> advertisers were defrauded of $ 13 million from 1980-84 He said RKO misinformed advertisers, ran spots at times other than those agreed and falsified ratings data. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> why the problem at <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Networks </ORGANIZATION>, coming after the WNAC license revocation, `` does n't suggest that management reforms were grossly inadequate. <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> conceded that `` there was this terrible problem at Radio Networks,'' but he said RKO's conduct violated no FCC rules or policies and noted that the company reported the problem to the commission. `` This company has been under an absolute microscope, in one hearing after another and inquiring into its activities, and I think it is very, very significant that in its actual broadcast operations _ what the stations were doing in their broadcast operations _ there was n't any significant impropriety and that should be the most importand thing,'' he said. The stations involved are: KHJ-TV, KHJ-AM and KRTH-FM, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; WHBQ-TV and WHBQ-AM, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; WOR-AM and <ORGANIZATION> WRKS-FM </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> WRKO-AM </ORGANIZATION> and WROR-FM, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; WGMS-AM, <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md.; WGMS-FM, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; KFRC-AM, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; WAXY-FM, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; and WFYR-FM, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> ILO </ORGANIZATION> has nothing to do with a political settlement, but as far as the labor field is concerned, it might try to do what it can.'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> acknowledged his organization falls short of being a tribunal and has no sanctions that it can impose for violations of its 161 internationally recognized labor standards. `` But we have lots of means of exercising pressure in the moral sense,'' he said. While Israeli authorities have tried to cope with <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> who live in the occupied territories but commute daily to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, several problems and distortions remain, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. `` Among the 100,000 Palestinians who work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, no more than 47 percent have regular employment,'' he said. `` There are bound to be differences when it comes to wages, especially where part-time workers are concerned.'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said his report will recommend seeking new assurances from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to both end discrimination against <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers and provide additional assistance to them. He acknowledged it is difficult to differentiate between labor and political rights in the current turmoil but said it would be a mistake to wait until a peace agreement is concluded before addressing the worker rights issues. `` In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and to less extent on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the situation calls for dramatic and urgent actions on bringing real development,'' he said. `` We ca n't remain in the status quo; the two have to move in parallel.'' Although <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has recognized <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> labor unions and even has some Arabs in the leadership of its own labor movement, their effectiveness has been set back by the recent uprisings. `` The Palestinian trade unions are being prevented from discharging their responsibilities because of measures taken by the military,'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. `` Israeli labor leaders show a lot of compassion to Palestinian workers but the government needs to do more to make it possible for the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> unions to operate.''

<HEAD>Lower Energy Costs, Stable Dollar Help Slow Import Goods Price
Hikes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices of imported goods climbed 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year, a slight slowdown from the October-December quarter because of lower energy costs and a more stable dollar, the government reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the January-March increase followed a 1.6 percent rise in the final three months of 1987. For the past 12 months, import prices have risen 7.1 percent. The price of foreign oil and other energy products fell 8 percent during the first quarter. If this drop in energy prices was removed, import prices would have risen a much faster 2.3 percent in the past three months. Foreign cars and machinery, which account for nearly half of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports, rose 1.7 percent in the first quarter after increasing 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter. Analysts said the latest government statistics confirm their view that the weaker dollar, which makes imports more expensive, is responsible for about half the inflation the country is now experiencing. Consumer prices rose 4.4 percent in 1987 and analysts said that increase would have been only about 2 percent without the rise in import costs. `` The dollar has been going down and we do n't think all of that has been passed through to consumers yet,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` Foreign producers had been eating much of the dollar's decline in lower profits, but they ca n't do that anymore.'' The import price report said that from January from March, the dollar lost 1.4 percent of its value on a trade-weighted basis compared with a 5.8 percent plunge in the October-December quarter. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, led by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, began working with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in September 1985 to drive the value of the dollar lower in an effort to shrink the country's huge foreign trade deficits. A weaker dollar makes American goods more competitive on overseas markets while driving up the cost of imports to Americans. In February 1987, after the dollar had fallen by almost 50 percent against the Japanese yen and the West German mark, the major industrial countries switched course and began trying to keep the dollar from falling further. That effort was unsuccessful in 1987 because stubbornly high merchandise trade deficits made investors believe the dollar had not dropped enough to cure the country's trade problems. Only two weeks ago, the dollar fell sharply because of a widening of the February <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. While the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit hit a record high of $ 171.2 billion last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Thursday that a new analysis by his office showed that the country's trade deficit has actually fallen by 23.2 percent since mid-1986, when the effects of the weaker dollar are removed. He said the monthly trade report, which does not factor out inflation, has masked the improvements that have been occurring in volume terms. But <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said financial markets will continue to react to monthly trade figures in current dollars until they start showing significant improvements as well. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export volume is growing very rapidly, but unfortunately not fast enough to overcome the sharp increases in import prices,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said the cost of American products being sold overseas rose by 1.4 percent during the first quarter, a drop from a 2 percent price increase in the final three months of 1987. This change was credited to a big slowdown in the cost of exported food products, which rose only 0.6 percent in the first quarter after shooting up by 9.1 percent in the fourth quarter. American grain prices rose 3.1 percent following a 14.2 percent jump in the fourth quarter as a drop in wheat prices helped offset continued increases in rice and corn prices. The price of American meat products rose 5.1 percent following six months of declines, while the index for fruits and vegetables fell for the fourth consecutive quarter.

<HEAD>Rightists Try to Shake Extremist Image</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of the conservative <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> party hope to step into a prominent role in the war-strapped government and are trying to shake their image of being right-wing extremists. The party, which won at least 30 of the 60 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in legislative elections March 20, has big hopes of winning the presidency next year. If it does, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s policy toward <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> will have to change drastically, party president <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. `` Relations will have to be based on mutual respect. No more coming down here and saying ` Here's so many millions of dollars and this is what you have to do,''' said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. The party, whose full name is the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, previously held only 13 assembly seats, so the election outcome was a devastating setback for President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. One seat remains in dispute, but the assembly is to be installed as scheduled Sunday. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> also won two-thirds of the municipal races at stake in March, including longtime <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> stronghold <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The conservative party once was best known for its controversial founder, cashiered army major <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, a 40-year-old Georgetown University-educated businessman, has been a major factor in the effort to leave behind the party's image of neo-fascist thugs. But the public relations project intended to present <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> as moderate suffers setbacks. Retired army Col. <PERSON> Sigifredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> leader and legislator-elect, recently called for `` insurrection'' against what he termed `` this ominous government, this treasonous High Command.'' He accused the armed forces leadership of selling out to `` North American intervention.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> have waged a constant campaign against <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, founded in 1981. `` We have always felt under tremendous attack from the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in the late 70s and early 80s, once called <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON> `` a pathological killer.'' <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> alleges that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy backed what the rightists claim was fraud in elections won by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 and 1985. Arena won the March elections by broadening its appeal beyond the rabidly anti-communist landed oligarchy it represented in the early 1980s. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has emerged as a leader since <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, a former major in army intelligence, decided in 1985 to share the limelight. `` He -LRB- d'Aubuisson -RRB- recognized that his figure and all that had been said about him were prejudicial to the party's image,'' said the strapping, soft-spoken <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who exports coffee and distributes pharmaceuticals. `` He expressed the desire to no longer be a preponderant figure and the party made the principal decision to become a political institution that does not depend on the charismatic image of one man ... that it should open up,'' said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. Arena has been routinely referred to by local and foreign media as `` far -'' or `` extreme-rightist. `` But if you had to place us in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political spectrum, we're closer to conservative Democrats or liberal Republicans than to conservative Republicans,'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said. Critics of the party say <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>'s continued prominence, as well as <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s, provide room for doubt about the party's professed commitment to democracy. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> favors establishment of a private banking sector parallel to the nationalized system and a private role in the state-run enterprises that export the country's main crops: coffee, sugar and cotton. An Arena government would try to resume the stalled dialogue with leftist guerrillas, but if that failed, military pressure would be increased. Some 65,000 people have been killed in the eight years of fighting, and the economy is crippled by inflation and unemployment estimated at 40 percent.

 Anxiety about drug trafficking and foreign economic power match fear of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as the top concerns of Americans, according to a survey issued Thursday by a group that includes pollsters for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Given a choice of seven national security goals, 22 percent of those surveyed picked combatting international drug traffic as the No. 1 priority. Another 18 percent said correcting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s growing trade imbalance was the most important goal Reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long range missiles was chosen by 15 percent of those surveyed. Keeping communist governments out of Central and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was the No. 1 national security desire of 13 percent of those quizzed, containing Soviet agression was the chief concern of 12 percent, stopping the threat of nuclear weapons topped the list for 11 percent and combatting terrorism was the priority for 5 percent. The poll said 59 percent of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people believe economic competitors like <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> pose more of a threat to national security than traditional military adversaries like the Soviets. It was the fourth poll in a series called `` Americans Talk Security,'' a 10-survey collaborative effort by four organizations, including <ORGANIZATION> Martilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' pollster, and Market Opinion Research of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, which works for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Martilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> conducted the latest poll, but the questions and analysis were approved by all four organizations. By a margin of 3-to-1, Americans believe economic power is more important than military strength in determining a country's influence in the world Asked about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 61 percent said they were improving, 4 percent thought they were getting worse and 34 percent said they were remaining the same. Seventy-six percent said they had a `` favorable'' general impression of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and 66 percent said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies will eventually create a more free and open society. Asked if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy should focus less on the Soviets and more on other threats to our security, 48 percent sought less focus on the Soviets and 42 said the focus should remain on the Soviets. The pollsters for the leading presidential candidates said they found encouraging results in the survey. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON>, who polls for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said the Democrats are pleased that the survey shows a `` broadening prism'' through which Americans look at security issues. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Steeper </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> company works for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said he was bouyed that 61 percent of Americans chose `` improved efficiency'' as the key to reducing the trade deficit compared to 24 percent who chose `` fairer trade practices.'' `` That result is a blow against a protectionist stance,'' Steeper said. The ATS poll was based on a March 22-27 national telephone survey of 1,004 Americans. The margin of error was 3 percent, ATS said.

<HEAD>TV Rejects Government Request to Postpone Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Television authorities on Thursday rejected a government request to postpone screening a program on the shooting of three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas by British commandos in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. The program, by <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, shows a witness saying two guerrillas had their hands raised, as if to give themselves up, when they were shot. Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, chairman of the controlling <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, to postpone the Thursday night broadcast until after an inquest into the March 6 shooting of the guerrillas, who had been on a bombing mission in the British colony. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said that the hourlong program, `` Death On The Rock,'' featured people due to testify at the inquest and complained that their accounts would influence the hearing. But the broadcast authority said the material was `` unlikely to prejudice'' the inquest and that postponing the program would give the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> more `` oxygen of publicity.'' The show was the result of a seven-week investigation which included interviews with 150 residents of apartments overlooking the area where the guerrillas were shot, according to <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION>. The British commandos' decision to shoot the guerrillas instead of trying to arrest them angered the Irish government and was criticized by British opposition parties and <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. The London-based human rights organization has begun its own inquiry. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> has said that the guerrillas made suspicious movements before they were shot. A Foreign Office spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said Thursday that <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> stood by that statement. The government's request to postpone `` Death on The Rock'' touched off a noisy debate Thursday in the House of Commons. Conservative <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said he was opposed to `` TV companies raking through the gutters of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> finding people to rubbish our security forces'' and was tired of `` people weeping tears for an active <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> unit'' that was plotting a massacre. But <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> spokesman, said the government was trying to block an examination of its `` conduct and policies by hiding behind the theory of an inquest.'' `` Those three -LRB- guerrillas -RRB- were unarmed,'' he said. `` They should have been arrested. They should have been charged.'' The <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> killings triggered a fresh outbreak of violence in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in which nine people, including two British soldiers, died. The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Rail Grain Car Shortage Blamed on Heavy Export Demand, No Building</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Heavy export demand for wheat and corn and `` the virtual stagnation of the covered hopper fleet since 1982'' created a shortage of railroad grain cars to move farmers' grain, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> transportation official said Thursday. Although car shortages appear to be easing somewhat in recent days, steps need to be taken to avoid a repetition of the crunch that occurred earlier this year, said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, head of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> released a study showing a severe disruption of grain shipments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year through mid-April because of shortages of covered hopper cars used by railroads. The study was requested by Reps. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, D-Kan., and <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Neb <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said he planned to cite the study further at a hearing Monday in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, conducted by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said the actual number of cars available for grain movement has been both shrinking and aging since 1982 when the last significant number was added to the nation's railroad fleet. There also has been a large surge in export wheat sales under the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Export Enhancement Program during the past few months. Big sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, in particular, have added to the railroad grain traffic. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, exporters can sell wheat or other designated commodities to an approved foreign country at reduced prices and then collect subsidies from <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> in the form of government-owned surplus grain or other agricultural products. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> told reporters there were many reasons for the problem and that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> policies regarding exports were not to blame. He said the `` overwhelming reason'' for <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> was to give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators leverage in multinational trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and also to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surpluses and to boost farm income. `` Those goals, I think, are ahead of the goal of keeping the -LRB- railroad -RRB- car supply adequate,'' he said. At another point, <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> programs, `` We believe we are not the problem in any way, because we believe we are doing our job. ... We're pround of what we've done.'' <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said that because of shortages of covered hopper cars some local elevators were unable to take delivery of grain from farmers, grain merchants had difficulty completing sales, and railroads hiked rates and restricted use of their cars in certain markets. Also, he said, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` received limited response'' to its weekly auctions of surplus wheat because of the car shortages. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> was asked whether the rail car shortages had interfered with shipments of grain to seaports to the extent that ships were kept waiting on grain to load. `` We do not believe that to be the case, as a general rule,'' he said. But there may have been `` some specific circumstances'' when that happened in the last six months. `` It's not a trend, it is not a significant problem down the road.'' Although reasons are not clear why the hopper car situation has improved the last 10 days, <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> noted that export demand has slackened somewhat and delivery dates have eased. Also, he said, railroads had received overbookings for cars from grain companies, and many of those now are being reconciled.

 The mother of <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> pleaded for the life of her son Thursday, telling the judge who will impose sentence that <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> did not kill the seven women whose bodies were found in and near his apartment. `` I do n't think you should take his life,'' said <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeter </PERSON>, wiping tears from her eyes. `` He did n't kill those people. The real murderer is still out there. I'm asking you to listen to your heart.'' Her testimony came during a hearing before Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latrone </PERSON>, who will decide whether to sentence <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 28, an unemployed handyman, to life imprisonment or death in the electric chair. `` I do n't want to appear heartless, but I have determined his guilt,'' <PERSON> Latrone </PERSON> said, referring to his verdict of guilty on Wednesday to seven counts of first degree murder and seven counts of abuse of corpse. `` I can well understand how you feel, but we are considering what the punishment might be.'' The hearing concluded at midafternoon. The judge did not specify when he would rule. <PERSON> Latrone </PERSON> had found that the prosecution proved that <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> killed seven women between January and August 1987 and kept their rotting remains locked in a room in a house he rented in north <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Rejecting an insanity defense, <PERSON> Latrone </PERSON> also found <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> knew what he was doing when he confessed to strangling the women as he had sex with them. The bodies were found after <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was evicted because of the stench coming from his apartment. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said death was the only punishment justifed for such `` sadistic murders.'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Harriell </PERSON>, mother of one of the victims, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, said: `` I believe he should die. I believe he should have a hard death. Nothing can bring back my daughter, and I am angry about that, but I would be angrier yet if he just sits in jail and gets fatter and fatter.'' Before Thursday's sentencing hearing began, the judge told <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> he could have a jury of 12 persons decide his fate. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> waived that right on the advice of his lawyer, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldovsky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> had also waived a jury trial, but under state law retained the right to have a jury decide the sentence. Latrone asked <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> several times whether he understood the right he was giving up and each time <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said he knew what he was doing. `` I want you'' to decide the sentence, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Muldovsky </PERSON> proceeded to call witnesses to keep his client from `` frying in the electric chair. He does n't deserve that.'' `` You're talking about a creature of habit who went back and back and back,'' King argued, referring to what he called `` the arrogant series of sex stranglings.'' Said <PERSON> Camelia </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShazor </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, mother of another of the victims, said, `` He deserves everything he gets.'' The first defense witness was <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s foster mother for five years `` <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> is a child in a man's body,'' she said. `` Marty is retarded. He was never raised to hate. He was raised to be obedient. <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> is alive. I want him to stay alive.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Says He'll Use Trade Veto Against Bush; Jackson Says He
Won't Quit</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> charged Thursday that Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had tried to `` manage Reaganomics'' rather than reverse it. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to `` put partisan politics aside'' and drop plans to veto trade legislation. All was quiet on the Republican front, where Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gained a mathematical lock on his nomination with the delegates earned in Tuesday's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary. The vice president was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, with his next campaign trip set for Friday to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent most of the day in his statehouse office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where he met with Spanish President <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Marques </PERSON> while his campaign organization welcomed a trickle of additional delegates to the fold. The converts included two delegates formerly backing Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and one supporter of Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Both men have suspended their campaigns, but have said they intend to hold onto their delegates until the party convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by more than 400 delegates in the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count, and holds more than 1,250 of the 2,081 needed to win the nomination. Aides say they hope he will command a nominating majority by the time the primary season ends on June 7. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> released a letter he sent to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urging him to sign the trade bill, which contains a provision requiring a 60-day notice to workers before a factory can be shut down. `` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, I believe that our record trade deficit requires that we put partisan politics aside and take action that will be in the best interest of all Americans,'' he wrote. Later, in a statehouse news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would make the trade bill an issue in his campaign against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I think the issues of workers being laid off, what is happening to the industrial base of this country, and the failure of this administration to do much to deal with that and what a new president would do to work hard with business and labor and community leaders to restore our competitive edge and rebuild our industrial base will be very much one of the major issues,'' he told reporters before leaving for a campaign trip to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has expressed support for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to veto the bill. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned across <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which holds its primary next week, and vowed to remain in the race. His rhetoric held a slightly sharper anti-Dukakis edge than before the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary, which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lost in a landslide. `` I do n't want to manage Reaganomics as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does, or keep <ORGANIZATION> Reaganomics </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does,'' he told an audience in <LOCATION> Steubenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` I want to reverse Reaganomics and re-invest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also fended off suggestions from his own campaign manager than he has given up on gaining the nomination in view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' string of primary victories in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in the past month. `` We intend to come out of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> -LRB- on the final day of the primary season -RRB- in search of a management team and a running mate,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` That is authoritative, fresh, clear, without fear of contradiction.'' He said any suggestions otherwise `` do not represent the spirit of the campaign,'' although he said campaign chief <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> had been an `` effective manager'' who would stay on the job. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> was quoted in published reports as saying of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: `` I think he thinks winning is n't just winning primaries. It's winning delegates and getting votes.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a year after entering the Democratic race, marveled that he was the front-runner. `` The remarkable thing is that the two leading candidates for the Democratic nomination are a first-generation American from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and a black guy who grew up poor in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` That, I think, says an enormous amount for this political system of ours.'' In other developments: _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> drew praise from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> at a meeting of black public administrators in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s strong candidacy has performed a `` psychological miracle'' for minorities seeking a leader. But, he added, `` it really does n't help at all if he's not elected president. It's not just a matter of feeling good. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> ran to see some good done for poor people and black people.'' _ Campaign officials for former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has ceased active campaigning in the Republican race, were given an additional two weeks to provide the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> with financial records. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a probe of the tax-exempt status of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s religious broadcasting network. _ Final results from the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> Democratic caucuses last week showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> edged out <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with the support of 46 percent of caucus-goers to 45 percent for his rival. If the division held, it would translate into eight national convention delegates for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and six for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must give highest priority to curbing demand for illicit drugs from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> if it expects to win the war against narcotics smuggling, a hemispheric committee said Thursday. In a report, the group said efforts to curb trafficking through eradication and interdiction have failed and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should refocus its attention to educating potential users to the dangers of drug addiction. The report was prepared by the Inter-American Dialogue, a non-partisan group of 62 noted citizens from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` As long as the profit margin for cocaine is 12,000 percent from production cost to street value, the lure of trafficking will be irresistible,'' the panel said in the 50-page report, which covered a variety of hemispheric issues. `` Primary attention must shift to demand.'' The commission is chaired by <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Linowitz </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON>, a former president of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Other members include two other former Latin American presidents and more than a dozen former cabinet members from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The report said efforts to reduce the supply of drugs from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are bound to be inadequate, and the high profit margin for drug smuggling `` will buy all the protection the drug lords need.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration initially concentrated its efforts on stopping drug smuggling at its source but recently has said more attention must be given to reducing demand. On Thursday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> directed his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to provide recommendations within 30 days on how to increase the federal effort against drug suppliers and users,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` We do n't have much time,'' the president was quoted as telling agency heads who took part in the meeting. `` But I want to do all I can to expand the drug fight.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s statement said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was briefed by board members `` on the status of existing efforts to interdict drugs coming into this country, and to reduce the demand for drugs within the country.'' `` The president was told that our nation must be intolerant of drug users, that half the murders in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> are drug-related, that gangs in many cities are being financed through drugs and that the government needs to be as tough as the law and the Constitution will allow in fighting drug use,'' it said. The statement said the board outlined `` the extensive interdiction effort now under way along <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> borders using <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> military and other civilian assets.'' It also said that Dr. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, the president's special adviser on drug abuse policy, told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> there are nearly 23 million drug users in this country. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a speech last February, `` As significant as stopping smugglers and pushers is, ending the demand for drugs is how, in the end, we'll win.'' The report also recommended that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> help other countries design and implement their own drug-control policies rather than apply pressure and threaten sanctions if these countries do not adopt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prescriptions. Under law, the administration is required to impose economic sanctions against countries which do not cooperate in curbing drug flows into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. This year, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> found that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> were not offering such cooperation, but no sanctions were applied because none is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid recipient. Many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are clamoring for sanctions against other countries, and on Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted in favor of taking such action against <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. Discussing <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the report said governments and insurgent movements in the region should strive to convert their military strife into peaceful competition. `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> must convince guerrilla forces in their countries that laying down their arms will open the way for full participation in national affairs,'' the report said. It also criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for not working in concert with other Latin American countries to arrange a settlement in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` Unilateral <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions and other pressures against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have hindered efforts by <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> leaders to promote a negotiated end to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis and mobilized widespread Latin American resentment to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Brother, Nephew of Marshal Arrested As Result of His Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HEFLIN, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal's family reunion two years ago led to a break in a 1980 murder case _ and an indictment this week against his own brother and a nephew. Investigators had worked for years with little progress in solving the slayings of four elderly people during an apparent robbery. Then, in 1986, the deputy marshal, <PERSON> Olbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON>, attended a family reunion and took a sawed-off shotgun, an illegal weapon, from his brother, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON>, 51. Later that year, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON>, a nephew of the <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> brothers, was arrested on charges of starting a fire in <ORGANIZATION> Talladega </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, and a .38 - caliber pistol was taken from him, District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> <PERSON> Olbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> then realized that the two guns matched descriptions of weapons used in the 1980 slayings of three brothers and a sister _ <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 79, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 73, <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 77, and <PERSON> Floy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 63. Two were bedridden when shot to death in the rural <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> community. Field said that ballistics tests run on the guns in 1986 confirmed <PERSON> Olbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON>'s suspicion that the weapons were used in the slayings. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> was arrested Tuesday on charges of hindering prosecution and possession of a sawed-off shotgun other than the one seized at the reunion, and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> 39, was arrested on perjury charges, said <LOCATION> Cleburn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, 29, was arrested Wednesday on perjury charges. The three men were being held in the county jail on $ 100,000 bail each. The indictment returned by a county grand jury accused <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> of interfering with the murder investigation by altering the second shotgun to make it appear that it was used in the slaying. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> gave `` criminal assistance to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> by intentionally hindering the apprehension, prosecution, conviction or punishment of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> for conduct constituting a murder.'' However, neither <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> has been charged with murder. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON>'s relationship to <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> was not immediately known. `` The grand jury listened to evidence that was surrounding the <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> case,'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Three people were indicted. ... I'm not going to say that the people who are in my jail are not suspects and I'm not going to say they are. `` I'm just going to say they are people who the grand jury saw fit to indict on those charges.'' He declined to comment on why the indictments were not returned sooner. Field said the grand jury will reconvene May 31 and more indictments might be returned. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> was convicted earlier and sentenced to 20 years in prison for possessing an illegal weapon, the sawed-off shotgun <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON> is alleged to have altered. He is free on bail while he appeals. Without <PERSON> Olbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON>, `` there would be no case,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. `` It's an unusual story.'' <PERSON> Olbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiett </PERSON>'s niece, <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Loveless </PERSON>, said she is not angry at him although his efforts put her father in jail. `` This is n't a vengeance thing,'' she said. `` They did n't have any falling out or anything like that. My uncle is a lawman and he is just doing his job. My father is just telling the truth _ that's all there is to it. Mrs. <PERSON> Loveless </PERSON> said her father `` is not guilty of anything. All he has done is tell the truth. My daddy has nothing to hide, so whether it is to his brother or to the sheriff or anyone else, he will say the same thing to them.'' Police have said they believe the motive was $ 1,500 in cash kept in a trunk, which was stolen and recovered two years later in woods three miles from the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' house. <PERSON> Verlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who discovered the bodies of her brothers and sister, said she was pleased to hear of apparent progress in the investigation. `` I'm kind of surprised,'' she said. `` I had waited so long and had n't heard anything. I thought maybe it would n't ever be solved.''

<HEAD>Art Ring Floods Germany With Fake Masterpieces</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH JAUTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A poor junk dealer who taught himself to paint churned out 2,500 copies of masterpieces and sold them for a pittance to an art ring, which netted up to $ 23 million by reselling them as originals, police said Thursday. The fake Picassos and other paintings were sold throughout the country during a 13-year period in one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s biggest art scandals, prosecutors said. At least two of the pictures hang in museums. Artist <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrugalla </PERSON>, 49, sold nearly all of them for relatively low prices to art dealerships in <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, police said. `` Picasso himself would have been proud of his work,'' said <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelen </PERSON>, the police officer in charge of the investigation. `` We were told repeatedly -LRB- by art experts -RRB- that he is a genius.'' `` This case is unique,'' he added. `` I have never seen anything like it.'' The dealers sold Mrugalla's works at huge mark-ups and kept the money, netting between $ 17 million and $ 23 million, police said. Mrugalla was living in poverty when he began cooperating with police earlier this month, they said. One of Mrugalla's fakes is hanging in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> museum and another is in a small museum in northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Engelen </PERSON> said. The rest are in the collections of private dealers or art and auction houses. <PERSON> Engelen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mrugalla </PERSON> copied from the works of more than 50 artists, including <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, Germans <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckmann </PERSON> and Austrian <PERSON> Oskar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kokoschka </PERSON>. Police said the `` fake-art ring'' that marketed <PERSON> Mrugalla </PERSON>'s works was believed to include about 25 people. <PERSON> Engelen </PERSON> said one of the ringleaders was in jail, but he declined to say how many other arrests have been made. He said <PERSON> Mrugalla </PERSON> rarely attempted to sell any of his fake art works himself, but passed them along to the <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> dealers. It was not immediately known whether <PERSON> Mrugalla </PERSON> was aware of the prices his works were commanding. He is free on his own recognizance, but could face charges of forgery and fraud. Mrugalla never had formal art training, the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said Thursday. He grew up in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and joined the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> at 14, then jumped ship and traveled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, where he opened a junk shop. While struggling to make his business profitable, <PERSON> Mrugalla </PERSON> began copying art works he saw hanging in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> museums, <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said. He later bought books on painting to teach himself technique. <PERSON> Engelen </PERSON> said only a portion of <PERSON> Mrugalla </PERSON>'s work has been traced. Thus far police have seized 100 lithographs supposedly by <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> and 24 alleged <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> sketches, he said.

<HEAD>FAA Finds No `Grossly Unsafe' Conditions in Eastern, Continental</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The special inspection of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> airlines has uncovered no `` grossly unsafe'' conditions so far, although planes were ordered out of service briefly because of safety infractions about 5 percent of the time, officials said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> began its plane-by-plane ramp inspections April 13 and so far has made more than 2,000 inspections at the two airlines, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> told reporters. He said inspections would continue through mid-May. Both airlines are owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest airline company, which also is under a special review by the federal government Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said the separate inspection into the management and financial practices of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> by his department is half completed and `` everything is going very well.'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> did not elaborate on any of the findings so far. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> and <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> met with reporters to announce a series of organizational changes at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> aimed primarily at centralizing more authority in the agency's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters over its various regional offices. But many of the questions turned to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and department probes of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and its two airline subsidiaries. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said there have been about 1,000 ramp inspections of aircraft at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and about the same number at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> so far with many of the aircraft inspected more than once at various airports. The two airlines together have about 580 planes. He said `` roughly 7 to 8 percent'' of the inspections at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and 3 percent of the inspections at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> have resulted in aircraft being taken out of service, although in some of the cases the corrections were made quickly and flights were not delayed. `` These are not unusual percentages,'' said <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, adding that they likely would be `` what we would find ... at other airlines'' undergoing a similarly intense series of ramp examinations. In some cases, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> corrected problems before they came to the attention of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors, he said. `` So far we have not found anything we would consider to be grossly unsafe on any aircraft,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. He described the problems found by inspectors as `` minor'' and said they ranged from dents and small tears in the aircraft skin to minor leaks and hydraulic gauges not being fully charged. But <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said that while such problems individually may not cause a plane to be unsafe, he was concerned about them in the aggregate if not corrected. `` We're dealing with the margin of safety here,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said, adding that if such problems are not corrected that margin could erode. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> and <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> ordered the special review of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> aircraft on April 13 after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> became concerned of continuing safety violations at the Miami-based airline. Eastern also was assessed with a proposed $ 823,000 fine because of earlier violations. Four days later, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> ordered the ramp inspections expanded to include the Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> as well, saying that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is considering leveling about $ 1 million in civil penalties against that airline. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has not provided details on what kind of problems were found that would lead to such penalties.

<HEAD>Report Calls for Separating Subsidies from Food Production Levels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One way to improve global farm policy would be to unhook, or decouple, government subsidies from specific levels of food production, a report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The policy of decoupling would lead to `` more efficient production of agricultural goods and lower production costs when compared to current farm policies,'' the report said. Some form of decoupling for American farmers has been advocated unsuccessfully in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for several years. One example would be to sign up farmers in a crop program and provide benefits without tying them to specific acreage or production levels. As defined by the center _ a part of the independent, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank, Resources for the Future _ decoupling would mean `` providing government support to farmers in ways that do not distort production, prices, consumption, resource allocation or trade.'' Multilateral decoupling would also eliminated worldwide trade distortions and `` give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> advantages on those agricultural products now having a competitive edge,'' the group said. Even unilateral decoupling was said to offer positive effects, including: increased general economic efficiency, lower production costs, greater competitiveness in international markets and improved environmental quality. `` Consumers would also gain as prices dropped,'' the report said. `` However, those sectors currently receiving the highest levels of government support _ those primarily in sugar, dairy, rice and wool _ would decline in size.'' The report added: `` Livestock and feed grain sectors, on the other hand, would be least affected by decoupling because of their already favorable competitive position in world markets. The effects on government and taxpayers remain uncertain, depending on the magnitude of the transition payments made to disadvantaged farmers.'' Decoupling does n't set well with some farm groups. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, for example, says it is tantamount to putting farmers on welfare by substituting direct federal payments for price supports. A statement issued by <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION> at its recent annual convention said, `` Farmers want federal program payments to help recover their cost of producing food. These payments are actually subsidies to consumers that pass through the hands of farmers.''

<HEAD>Congressmen Striving To Block Federal Money For Shopping Center</HEAD>

 Three congressmen said Thursday they are striving to block federal highway money for a shopping center to be built adjacent to a major Civil War battlefield in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, has introduced language into a supplemental appropriations bill that would prohibit federal highway money from being used for road improvements near the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Battlefield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Developers plan to build a 1.2 million square-foot shopping mall adjacent to the battlefield. <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON> and other self-proclaimed Civil War buffs in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said the project will violate the sanctity of the battlefield. `` The battlefield that helped shape the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> we know today should not be the sight of a <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> or a Mattressland,'' said <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>. `` We should not be building on top of a lot of Union and Confederate soldiers who still lie today where they fell in battle.'' The battlefield is where two significant Civil War clashes were fought, known in the North as the Battles of Bull Run, and called the Battles of <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> in the South. The first battle, fought on July 21, 1861, was the initial major confrontation of the Civil War, and a surprising Confederate victory helped convince <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> officials that the war would be a prolonged effort. The second battle, a bloody affair Aug. 29-30, 1862 that saw 24,000 casualties, was a costly victory for Confederate forces. Union forces that had been as far south as <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> two months earlier were driven back into the nation's capital. Supporters of the development plan claim that the project will not violate the battlefield, but <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the project will be built on the spot where Confederate Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> had his headquarters for the second battle. <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>'s amendment, passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations transportation subcommittee, would block use of federal money for highway projects needed to improve access to the rural battleground. Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, D-Minn., said <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>'s plan is a stop-gap measure intended to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to use money from a special fund to purchase and protect the 600-acre land parcel `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is certainly acting in the national interest, so that this hallowed land can be saved,'' said <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, who chairs an Interior and Insular Affairs panel that deals with national parklands. `` This is an awkward but necessary move.''

<HEAD>Mulroney Assured Congress Won't Derail Free-Trade Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said Thursday he won assurances from congressional leaders that they will not derail U.S.-Canada free trade legislation out of pique with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan to veto the omnibus trade bill. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, ending two days of meetings with administration and <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> leaders, told reporters, `` I am leaving with the assurance that congressional consideration will proceed on schedule despite the uncertaintly surrounding the omnibus trade bill.'' The schedule calls for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to put enabling legislation for the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement on a `` fast track'' as soon as the administration sends the bill to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, sometime after June 1. The agreement, hailed by <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as `` historic,'' provides for eventual elimination of tariffs and other steps to stimulate what is already the world's highest-volume bilateral trading relationship. The pact is separate from the overall trade bill adopted Wednesday but there have been muted threats on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> that implementation of the U.S.-Canada pact eagerly sought by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might be slowed as a protest over his planned veto of the trade bill. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, have said they would not hold the Canadian accord `` hostage,'' and these assurances were given to <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> in meetings on Thursday, the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> leader In those discussions _ and in his second meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in as many days _ <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> reasserted his plea that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> set specific timetables and targets for the reduction of acid rain, which carries pollution and kills lakes and forests. `` I told the president what I told the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the House: that a treaty on acid rain between <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is inevitable, just as surely as summer follows spring,'' he said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says more scientific investigation is needed before it makes a commitment to specific clean-up goals. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decided that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Canadian External Affairs Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> would give `` priority'' to discussions of an eight-point Canadian plan for narrowing the differences, but he acknowledged the plan contains the provisions already rejected by the administration. Still, he asserted that by airing the problem in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> he had advanced <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s cause on the issue, and he reacted testily to a news conference questioner's suggestion he was returning to <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> empty-handed. `` Look it, we're looking at a very complex matter,'' he said. `` We're moving it forward, well see what happens. What do you do? Do you declare war? Interrupt relationships? Or do you actively work as I've been doing to persuade Americans of the value and legitimacy of the Canadian position.'' `` We were nowhere in 1980 and in 1984, and we're slowly but surely trying to move it along,'' he said. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> also confirmed reports from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would contribute personnel to a multinational <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team that will observe the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Under the plan, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would provide about a half-dozen of the 50-member contingent, which would observe Soviet compliance with its pledge to pull its estimated 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by early next year. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said the decision to contribute was in keeping with a traditional Canadian commitment to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping operations. The prime minister used his news conference to take a dig or two at his political opponents at home. Asked if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had expressed reservations about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> willingness to let <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> buy submarines containing closely held <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear propulsion plants if the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gains power in the next election, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said: `` We dealt with realistic matters.''

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Accuses US of `Imprudent' Statements</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An opposition leader accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Thursday of `` imprudent and inconsiderate'' statements that interfere with South Korean politics. Prosecutors meanwhile arrested the former mayor of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on graft charges in the continuing investigation of alleged corruption under the administration of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. About 1,500 students hurled firebombs during a demonstration against the government and the `` economic aggression'' of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in demanding freer markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, leader of the main opposition party, told a news conference the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had supported the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> in February, because of `` selfish interests.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> interfered in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> politics by receiving <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> on a visit shortly before the December presidential election, expressing confidence that the election would be fair and issuing a favorable report on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s performance on human rights. `` This is an imprudent and inconsiderate position,'' he said. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> won the presidency with 36.6 percent of the vote. Opposition support was split between <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and his rival, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>. Former Mayor <PERSON> Yum </PERSON> <PERSON> Bo-hyun </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, appointed by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, was charged with peddling influence and taking bribes. Prosecutors said a construction company offered Yum $ 160,000 and the former president's younger brother <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON> $ 270,000 in 1985 when seeking a contract to build city parks. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s brother was charged March 31 with embezzling millions of dollars. The corruption probe has been seen as part of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s effort to distance himself from the authoritarian <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> government, which was the target of huge public protests last summer. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s three main opposition parties, which defeated the government <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in elections Tuesday and won a majority in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, accuse the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s administration of exposing only part of the alleged corruption. They want the investigation expanded. The constitution that took effect in February gives the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> investigative powers. The three parties have ruled out a merger but are considering ways to coordinate tactics in the assembly. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-pil </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has proposed a liaison office. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, who leads the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said they would consider it. Of the 299 National Assembly seats, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>'s party has 71, the followers of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> 59 and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-pil </PERSON>, a former conservative prime minister, 35. The government party has 125 seats. The other nine seats are held by smaller parties. In the student demonstration at <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, protesters shouted `` Yankee go home!'' and demanded that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> end its pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for trade concessions. They also demanded removal of nuclear weapons they claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is storing in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> will not comment on whether it keeps nuclear weapons in this country. Students hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police, shouting `` Overthrow the dictatorship, which permits <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aggression!'' Police responded with tear gas. No injuries or arrests were reported.

 New opposition developed Thursday on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to sending <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boats to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, while the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commandant defended the proposal by saying it would n't hurt anti-drug efforts at home Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, D-Wash., introduced a measure in the House that would ban use of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in the gulf `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration should use the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s scarce resources to fight the war on drugs, not the Iran-Iran war,'' <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., told his colleagues it would be a mistake to send lightly armed <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels into the war-torn gulf <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>'s proposal will be considered next week as an amendment to a bill authorizing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the restriction `` will win in a breeze It's no contest.'' The rising public fear about the nation's drug problems means the restriction will win, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> explained. `` Taking the boats off drug duty and putting them into the gulf wo n't be popular with the public,'' he said. The Pentagon is considering sending six <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boats to help <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships patrol the gulf. The Coast Guard vessels are designed for shallow waters, and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials say they could be effective in the shallow gulf. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is escorting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers, raising fears in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might be drawn into the Iran-Iraq war since Kuwaiti is an Iraqi ally. There have been several clashes between the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the most recent occurring April 18 when <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and planes sank or damaged six Iranian vessels. Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commandant, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that he `` would be delighted'' to send the ships to the gulf and said the move would have only `` a minimal impact'' on anti-drug efforts. The boats are 110-foot `` Island'' class vessels, designed to operate in waters off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> on anti-drug patrols. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is buying 35 of the vessels, of which 17 have een delivered. The boats have a top speed of more than 26 knots, but their heaviest weapons are machine guns. Pentagon officials had considered sending the boats to the gulf last fall, but declined because they are so lightly armed. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> told the Appropriations transportation subcommittee the boats would be replaced on anti-drug patrols by other <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels and by some <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships. But earlier, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> had been questioned about anti-drug efforts and admitted, `` you can always use more'' money and boats. Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., `` it seems to me we're going to hurt our drug efforts'' by sending the boats to the gulf Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, was even more critical. `` I think it's an incredible policy,'' he told <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>. `` We kind of bumbled our way into this.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is facing severe budget problems, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> told the subcommittee, including a $ 100 million shortfall in the current fiscal year. More than 30 stations or facilities have been closed and anti-drug patrols have been cut by 55 percent. Administratively, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, but it also has national security responsibilities, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has offered to pay the cost of sending the vessels to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> defended the plan. `` This is not an idea off the top of somebody's head. It was well thought out and researched,'' he said. But <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> saw it differently. `` Sending the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to the gulf would be just another tragic, dangerous and poorly conceived move by the administration.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it is postponing its fall television season by almost two months, and possibly longer, because of a scriptwriters strike and the possibility of a second strike this summer by craft workers. Network officials declined to comment Thursday beyond the release of a brief statement sent from <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, to CBS-affiliated stations. The network, ranked third in the Nielsen ratings this season for the first time in its history, had planned to begin its new fall programming Sept. 5. However, it wo n't begin now until the end of October, at the earliest. The other two networks have not yet announced details on when their fall seasons would begin. The schedule at No. 1 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will include the Summer Olympics, beginning Sept. 16, and the World Series in late October. Although the strike had stopped production of 22 late-season episodes of television series at the three networks, the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> postponement was the first real blow to the entertainment industry by the 8-week-old job action. `` We've been predicting that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> stood first in line to feel the impact of the strike because of their early start date,'' said <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a good example of why the producers should return to the table.'' The 9,000-member guild went on strike March 7 and no new negotiations have been set. The contract dispute has focused largely on residual payments for movies and TV programs shown overseas and on residuals for hourlong TV shows sold into syndication. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, the studio bargaining unit, said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' decision `` will result in an economic loss for the writers The bottom line is that we would like very much for the town to go back to work.'' In his message sent to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> stations Wednesday night, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> stated that, `` given the continuing strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the uncertainty over the IATSE-Teamsters negotiations in the film industry this summer, the previously announced Sept. 5 start date for the 1988-89 season is no longer feasible.'' `` We are looking forward to a new season start date at the end of October 1988,'' the message said. `` Further details and an exact start date will be forthcoming.'' The contract of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 25,000 Hollywood behind-the-camera production workers, expires expires July 31, said <ORGANIZATION> IATSE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>. But <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> said: `` We are certainly not going to take the blame for them delaying the start of their season. I suppose there's always uncertainty when you go into negotiations, but no more so now that in the past 100 years. `` Our president, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditolla </PERSON>, has made it crystal clear that he is not going into these negotiations with the idea of going on strike.'' A Writers Guild strike also delayed the 1981-82 season for several weeks. The year before, a strike by movie and television actors in 1980 delayed the opening of that year's television season for all three networks. <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, said last week that he did not know when the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> fall season would begin, although the lineup was set to be announced on May 23. At <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON> said Thursday, `` Our schedule is OK so far. But it will all depend on how long the strike lasts. We will announce our fall schedule on May 18.'' <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, has said that for all intents and purposes <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> would not begin its fall schedule until after the World Series.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration will try through legislation to cut off millions of dollars in federal aid to cities with rent control, but a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman said Thursday the plan is sure to be defeated. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, released a letter from <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which said the administration would propose legislation for fiscal 1989 to restrict rental rehabilitation grants to areas without rent control laws. `` The restriction can not go into effect until legislation has been adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by the president,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> wrote. Originally, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> had suggested making the change through federal regulation. But <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said his department `` has always maintained that it would require legislation'' to change the grant program. `` The letter is a carefully worded admission of defeat,'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said Thursday of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s comments. `` Administration officials first tried to impose their callous plan through regulation because they knew legislation to interfere with local housing laws would stand no chance in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Once they saw that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would not let their regulation go into effect, they backed off.'' In January, budget documents prepared by <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> detailed a plan to enact a federal regulation that would cut aid to cities with rent control laws. The government distributes $ 200 million annually in such funds, which are used for major repairs to correct violations of building codes. More than 200 cities, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, have some form of rent control. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> estimated that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would lose $ 20 million under the administration's plan.

<HEAD>House Votes To Ban Most U.S. Nuclear Weapons Tests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> clamped another arms control restriction on the White House by voting 214-186 on Thursday to ban all but the smallest tests of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons. The vote was the third time in two days the Democratic-controlled chamber approved arms control restrictions opposed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Earlier in the day, the chamber rejected a proposal to ban all final-stage tests of an anti-satellite weapon. But the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says it already has dropped development of the weapon because of earlier congressional restrictions. The decisions came as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> worked on a bill authorizing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget for the fiscal year which begins Oct. 1. All three arms control votes were essentially repeats of restrictions added by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last year to its Pentagon budget bill. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> finished work Thursday on its version of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill. Even though that panel also is controlled by Democrats, the administration's defense program fared better in the committee than it did in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. For example, the only arms control restriction the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel approved was a ban on any tests of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars system that would violate the `` narrow'' interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills both authorize $ 299.5 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending for the next fiscal year, a figure set by last December's budget summit between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> designed to reduce federal deficits. Differences between the two measures will have to be reconciled later by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. In votes Thursday, the House:

 _ Decided, on the 214-186 decision that went generally along party lines, to ban all underground nuclear tests of weapons larger than one kiloton The decision came after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed, 399-0, a Republican-backed amendment praising <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s effort to negotiate limits on testing. The ban was voted last year by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but was dropped by the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> and ended up as only an advisory request. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON>, R-Mich., told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> the ban would `` totally undercut our negotiators,'' a reference to the ongoing U.S.-Soviet talks aimed at a comprehensive ban on all nuclear tests But Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, D-Mo., said, `` We owe it to our children'' to vigorously pursue a total ban on all atomic tests Open-air atomic tests are banned by a 1963 treaty, but that pact allows underground tests. _ Rejected, 205-197, the anti-satellite ban proposed for a fourth year by Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION> But the panel also turned down, 212-195, a proposal to spend $ 100 million for development of a ground-based anti-satellite weapon. The restriction had been imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the past three years and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> responded by dropping work on the program to develop an ASAT weapon fired from a high-flying F-15 jet. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is working on different types of ASATs, particularly those using ground-based lasers. Earlier in the week, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had voted to ban any Star Wars tests that would violate the narrow interpretation of the ABM pact. It also voted to require continued compliance with numerical limits in the unratified 1979 SALT II pact. `` The only restriction we added was the ABM intepretation language,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the panel The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel recommended $ 4.6 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, as Star Wars is formally known. The bill on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor provides $ 4 billion, although next week's scheduled debate over SDI could mean changes in that total. Currently, SDI receives $ 3.9 billion and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought $ 4.8 billion for the next fiscal year. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure also includes a proposal creating a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> commission which would determine unneeded military bases that could be closed. No similar proposal is part of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill also approved <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for a 4.3 percent pay hike for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 2.1 million uniformed military personnel. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure proposes a 4 percent increase.

<HEAD>Proposed Constitution For Hong Kong Could Limit Basic Freedoms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Hong Kong-Chinese committee on Thursday unveiled a proposed constitution for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> that guarantees that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will not impose socialism for a 50-year period but contains measures that could limit freedoms. The draft of the Basic Law promises freedom of speech, press, assembly and religion. However, it says those rights may be restricted in the thriving capitalist city when necessary to maintain national security, public order, public health and morals. Another measure gives <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Communist Party-controlled legislature, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, final power to interpret and amend the Basic Law. Under a 1984 pact, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> will revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 99-year lease on the bulk of the territory expires. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who believes the draft violates the spirit of the 1984 Chinese-British agreement promising <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> substantial autonomy, said the matter is in the hands of the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> people. `` If it becomes clear to everybody that the people of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> want to have the democratic option and not an undemocratic one then it's a political factor <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has to take into account. I hope they will,'' he said. `` If we do n't speak with one voice then we are doomed to have an undemocratic system,'' he said. Copies of the 59-page draft in Chinese and in English were to be made available to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s 5.7 million residents beginning Friday at banks, subway stations and other public places. Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s British-appointed governor, urged residents to `` study the document very carefully.'' The draft outlines procedures for establishing a semi-autonomous system to govern the enclave as a `` special administrative region'' under <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` one country, two systems'' policy, which permits capitalism for 50 years. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> would have its own tax system, courts, education system and social welfare organizations. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents have five months to comment on the proposed constitution before the 58-member draft committee resumes deliberations. A 177-member <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, comprised of local civic leaders approved by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, will compile the opinions. The consultative committee said it will also consider public opinion poll results but does not plan to conduct its own surveys, said vice chairman Lo Tak-shing. The consultative committee plans to hold seminars and some Chinese officials are scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in June and September to talk to residents about the proposed Basic Law. A final version is expected to be approved in 1990 by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> The draft committee, made up of 33 members from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and 25 from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, debated the draft for 2 -LCB- years. `` As a whole it -LRB- the draft -RRB- is not really a bad job, although if we had more time it could be better,'' ssaid <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yiuchu </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> lawyer and member of the draft committee. `` I made reservations about certain things that have not been made clear in the draft,'' she said, including the relationship between <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s courts and those on the mainland. The panel was unable to agree on several clauses. Instead, it issued multiple proposals on some issues, including the selection of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s post-1997 government. The draft contains four alternate forumulas for electing a legislature. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, made up of several islands and a strip of land along <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s southeastern coast, has been ruled by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victoria </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> wrenched it from declining imperial <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1842. Most <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents are ethnic Chinese, and many fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after the 1949 Communist takeover. Thousands have emigrated since 1984 because of fear of Communist rule, and many more say they may do so, depending on how the Basic Law is worded.

Violence</HEAD>

 Sinhalese extremists killed at least two people and set fire to a railway station as part of their campaign to disrupt provincial elections on Thursday, police said. Voting was held for four of the nine provincial councils. Thirteen political parties boycotted the vote, saying general elections should precede regional voting. More than 15,000 police were deployed in the four provinces, where 2.8 million voters were eligible to select 155 council representatives. The elections will help form autonomous regional councils for the first time in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s history. When voting ended at 4 p.m. -LRB- 6:30 a.m. EDT -RRB-, turnout was estimated at only 45 percent, an election official said. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an underground, ultranationalist Sinhalese organization, opposed the elections because they were designed to give greater autonomy to the minority Tamils. Tamil guerrillas have fought since 1983 for an independent homeland in the north and east. The Front says a peace accord signed in July 1987 makes too many concessions to the Tamils, who form 18 percent of the country's 16 million population and who complain of discrimination. The Sinhalese community comprises 75 percent of the population. The accord was signed by <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which has a large Tamil population in its southern region and is helping disarm the rebels. Police officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said members of the Front set a railway station on fire at <LOCATION> Nagolagama </LOCATION>, 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Yapahuwa </LOCATION>, 25 miles farther north, a police constable was shot and killed by two men on a motorcycle, police said. A voter was killed at <LOCATION> Wellawaya </LOCATION>, 110 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. At least three deaths earlier this month were blamed on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which the government accused of trying to kill President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> last August. First results of the voting are not expected until Friday. Thursday's elections were in the Northwestern Province, the <ORGANIZATION> North-Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> and the Uva and <LOCATION> Sabaragamuwa </LOCATION> districts in the south. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>; the opposition <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group of three leftist parties, and the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> Moslem <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> took part in the elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition party, was among those boycotting the vote.

<HEAD>Senate Virtually Kills Extension of Amnesty for Illegal Aliens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday night virtually killed any chance that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would vote to extend the May 4 deadline for illegal aliens to apply for amnesty. The action came on a procedural vote to shut off debate by those who oppose extending the amnesty to Nov. 30. Only 40 senators voted to shut off the debate and 60 votes are needed to do so. Fifty-six senators voted against shutting off debate. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be in recess when the deadline arrives next Wednesday, so there is no chance that proponents of the extension can try again. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the extension on April 21 by a 213-201 vote. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had recommended a presidential veto. If President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> followed the advice, his veto likely would have been sustained. Immediately after the vote, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., urged all senators to tell their constituents: `` May 4 at midnight is the final time for application for amnesty and they must know that `` This extraordinary act of grace will end May 4 when we are in recess. This is it,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. The immigration law enacted in 1986 was finely tuned legislation that carefully balanced a legalization program for illegal aliens with penalties for employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote and the narrow <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> margin demonstrated that amnesty for those who came to this country illegally before Jan. 1, 1982 remains an emotional issue. Aliens who came to this country illegally before 1982 and have lived here continually since then were given one year to apply for temporary residency as the first step toward permanent status. May 4 ends the one-year period. Immigration offices will remain open until midnight on Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> already has begun a program that allows people to sign up now and produce the necessary documentation later. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, speaking for senators opposing the extension, said that illegal border crossings _ which dropped after the new law was passed _ have increased greatly in recent months. `` After an initial period when the law was taken seriously, the level of illegal immigration has risen by 60 percent over the last year,'' he said. `` When people are asked why they are coming, they say they do n't believe the law is going to be enforced.'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> added that the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> is finding a large increase in the use of false documents by illegal aliens. He said the extension proposal is `` fueling the fire that is already sending millions of people across our borders illegally.'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would have vetoed the bill and that veto would have been sustained. He warned before the vote that the extension bill would raise false hopes and illegal aliens who waited past the May 4 deadline would `` lose the opportunity to get the best gift <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has _ to be in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> legally.'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. speaking for the extension, said, `` It's hard to comprehend the intense opposition that some senators are bringing to this issue.'' He said `` of all the people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' illegal aliens `` are the least likely to know their rights. But they do have rights.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., also backed the extension, commenting, `` We have little to lose and much to gain by extending the application period. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., said the extension should be passed because `` This game started late The effort by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, however well intended, has not been sufficient. There are people who are eligible, but timid.'' But <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, the chief sponsor of the 1986 law, carried the day, commenting that with some 1.3 million applications so far, the legalization program is working. Applications have been approved at about a 95 percent rate. `` If you want to live your dream, here's your chance,'' he said. `` It will never come again.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday approved legislation designed to make tennis star <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen in time to play for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic team in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> this summer. But a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the team members already have been selected and it is unlikely a player would be bumped to make room for <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> even if the Czech native receives <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship and clears another series of procedural hurdles to become eligible. `` This would put us in a very difficult situation,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabricius </PERSON>, director of communications for the association. `` I do n't see it happening.

The committee's voice vote came one week after a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> immigration subcommittee, which traditionally opposes Olympic-tied exemptions, agreed to the measure. The bill would waive for <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> the five-year period permanent residents are required to wait before receiving citizenship. <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON>, 28, the world's No. 1-ranked tennis player, is a native of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, but has lived in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, since 1981 and has adopted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as his home.

 A Politburo member went to a huge steel plant where half the workers were on strike Thursday, but there was no sign of an end to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor trouble since the Solidarity days of 1980-81. Police detained three senior Solidarity leaders and an organizer of another strike set for Friday in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, said members of the independent union federation, which was born in 1980 and outlawed after the Communist authorities declared martial law in December 1981. <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, an adviser to Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, said police stopped his car in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> in the southern industrial belt and detained him, Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> remained in custody. <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaberna </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist who announced plans for the strike at the 18,000-worker heavy machinery plant, was apprehended by police on the street, said Solidarity spokesmen <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Politburo member <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> steelworks works at <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> about 65 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>. His trip coincided with a warning to strikers that their 3-day-old work stoppage was illegal, and a breakdown in talks between management and an unofficial strike committee. State television gave the strike prominent attention Thursday night, saying it was against the law and talks had begun with the plant's official union. <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> told reporters Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Szalajda </PERSON> was on his way to <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>. Strikers said later they were told <PERSON> Szalajda </PERSON> had arrived, but the leader of the plant's official union denied it. Workers expressed anger that management began talks Thursday with the government-sanctioned union. Several hundred students rallied in support of the strikers but police dispersed them. The strike at the 32,000-worker <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> plant is the biggest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since those that swept the country after food price increases in 1980, which brought down a government and led to the imposition of martial law. Organizers said at least 16,000 people had stopped work at the plant in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>, whose name means <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mill </ORGANIZATION>. The town was built in the 1950s as a model socialist community. About 12,000-14 ,000 strikers were said to be inside the plant They were able to go in and out, and some went home to rest. Workers who strike in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> customarily go to their place of employment, but instead of working they hold meetings, pass out pamphlets or even sleep. Demands at <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> include an immediate 50 percent increase in average monthly pay of $ 105. The unofficial strike committee also said $ 15 paid monthly in compensation nationwide for recent price increases should be doubled for industrial workers, teachers, health care workers and retirees. Prices in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> rose 42 percent in the first three months of 1988 because of government reductions in subsidies on many consumer items. `` We are still waiting in vain for a proposal to meet the mill management'' again, <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Handzlik </PERSON>, a dismissed Solidarity activist, said Thursday evening. `` We feel it is a test of nerves at the moment.'' He said by telephone from the plant that force might be used against the strikers. <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, who met Western reporters by chance, said when asked about the comment: `` I do n't think that will be necessary.'' <PERSON> Handzlik </PERSON> and other strikers said later they were told by management that <PERSON> Szalajda </PERSON>, the chief government official for industrial policy, was holding a `` crisis staff meeting'' with management. <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitkowski </PERSON>, head of the official union at the plant, said <PERSON> Szalajda </PERSON> was not there. A report by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Szalajda </PERSON> was meeting with steel company executives in nearby <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION> `` to discuss the possibility of changing the production structure'' in the metals industry. Involvement of two such senior officials would indicate deep official concern about the strike only days before May Day, the international Labor Day that is a time of official celebration and anti-government protest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, factory officials confiscated the work passes of some employees in an attempt block the strike, called to begin at 7 a.m. Friday, <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Negotiations with the official union at <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> appeared to be an effort to seize the initiative from an unofficial 16-member committee formed when the strike began Tuesday. `` The crew reacts with outrage,'' <PERSON> Handzlik </PERSON> said from the plant. `` Proposals put forth by the official unions are very vague and pay issues are almost put off indefinitely.'' The last talks with the strike committee took place early Thursday, soon after midnight, and lasted only 15 minutes, strikers said. They reported threats that failure to reach agreement could lead to police intervention.

<HEAD>U.S. Banning Imports Of Elephant Ivory From Burundi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is banning imports of elephant ivory originating from stockpiles in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> no matter where they may be shipped from, the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. To bolster international efforts to save endangered African elephants, other countries are being asked to take similar action against a <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> stockpile of ivory believed harvested by poachers in other countries, said spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> is a Maryland-sized central African nation without wild elephants of its own. Although ivory shipments from <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> in violation of treaties could not be accepted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, without Thursday's action there would be no legal bar to importation of carved or otherwise worked items made in third countries from ivory shipped from <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>. Swiss-based officials of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species and others sources have confirmed that about 16,000 tusks or 94 tons of ivory have accumulated under private ownership in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> said. The ivory was accumulated before <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> last November banned imports outside of the convention, and officials there say they have no legal way to prevent export of the material. `` We do n't want this ivory in international trade,'' said <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON>. `` Because <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> has no wild elephants and no ivory-producing country has authorized exports to <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> since the control system began in December 1986, Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> law enforcement officials believe this stockpile was obtained illegally.'' <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> is not one of the 95 nations that have signed the convention and has been used as a shipping point by people trying to get around quotas on ivory from elephants killed in other countries, said <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON>. The neighbors of <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> _ do have elephants, which have been severely threatened by poaching and loss of habitat. From an estimated 1.5 million animals 10 years ago, the population has fallen to about 760,000. For this reason, nations with elephants have agreed on quotas for ivory shipments, and a registration and tracking system for tusks taken according to the quotas. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> cooperates in the quota system and banned non-treaty imports of ivory last November, but says it has no legal way to act against ivory imported before that. When registration began on Dec. 1, 1986, 18,148 tusks totaling 98.6 tons were listed by <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>. Such previously accumulated inventories were exempt and could be sold, and the tusks went to carvers in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The current stockpile is not registered with the convention. About 770 to 900 tons of ivory are traded every year. Tusks are worth about $ 50 million and carved items $ 500 million or more, <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of demonstrators set up flaming barricades on the streets of the capital Thursday in a protest calling for the ouster of military strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Hours before the demonstration, government security agents arrested 30 people in a crackdown on opposition activists. Others were being sought by police. Attorney General <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalaz </PERSON> told a news conference those arrested were planning a three-day campaign of violence which he said may have included tampering with two locks of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Among those arrested was <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. In a statement, the society called it `` one more proof of the constant violation of human rights by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> of the Republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' Riot police lobbed tear-gas canisters and fired birdshot into the air to break up small pockets of demonstrators on the <LOCATION> Via </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espana </LOCATION>, a main thoroughfare in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Barricades of burning tires, garbage and boxes blocked some side streets. Several arrests were reported. The protesters, some on balconies high above the burning rubbish, chanted, `` Get Out, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>!'' `` Justice!'' and `` Down With Pineapple Face!'' _ a derogatory reference to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` We are civilistas and we want democracy and justice in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>!,'' shouted a middle-age woman. Civilistas refers to supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, which has organized protests against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> since June. The demonstration, however, was not the large-scale turnout hoped for by the opposition. The protest started on Via Espana in the heart of an upper-class shopping district, not far from many of the banks that make up this city's international financial center. Merchants shuttered windows as a precaution against violence. Truckloads of police and riot troops patrolled streets and a water cannon was used to discourage protesters. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen and their dependents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to stay out of public places where demonstrations might occur. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is chief of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member Defense Forces and the power behind the government. The crackdowns came as a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official was reported to be meeting with the Panamanian general, who has been indicted on drug-trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies the charges. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, an aide to Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, returned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for the second time in two weeks, said a source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials reportedly have been seeking more subtle ways to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down after failing to dislodge the general with sweeping economic sanctions. The sanctions have created a severe cash shortage in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> suggested the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration would be satisfied if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> resigns as head of the country's military forces. Previously, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials insisted that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. None of the people arrested Thursday were leaders of the Civic Crusade. <PERSON> Villalaz </PERSON> said earlier the arrest order applied to 35 directors of the Civic Crusade, plus an unspecified number of neighborhood leaders of the planned demonstration. <PERSON> Villalaz </PERSON> said arrests were made after intelligence agents uncovered an opposition plan that `` constituted a movement aimed at carrying out acts of violence'' beginning Thursday. Weapons, documents describing how to make firebombs and papers describing the workings of the <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION> locks of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> were found during raids Thursday, <PERSON> Villalaz </PERSON> said. Opposition activists want `` to find a formula through which the functioning of the <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> locks will be affected,'' he said. Agents raided the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Odontological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. All three organizations complained the raids were carried out without proper warrants. Efforts to reach opposition leaders for comment were not immediately successful. Many have been in hiding since their headquarters in a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotel was raided March 28 after a protest and more than 40 people were arrested. The Civic Crusade has been unable to attract enough support for a major protest since the March rally was smashed by riot police. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> ruled Thursday that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could challenge his indictment on drug-trafficking charges without surrending himself to authorities. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> lawyer 10 days to submit challenges to the Feb. 4 indictment.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that an illegal practice allowed 175,000 gallons of crude oil to seep into bird sanctuaries and bays, killing almost 200 waterfowl and other wildlife and threatening more Thursday. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>, principal engineer with the state <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, called the spill an ecological disaster and estimated that it could cost <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> $ 3 million in penalties and $ 1 million in cleanup costs. About 100 cleanup workers Thursday were rushed into area wetlands where winds and rising tides threatened to expand the spill, which occurred during the nesting season 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The spill occurred Friday night or early Saturday when a drainpipe that carries off rainwater through the middle of an oil tank at <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s major northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> refinery broke inside the tank, allowing oil to be siphoned out. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that it regularly allowed rain collected from the roof of the tank to flow uninspected into a nearby marsh. The practice violated federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> regulations, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s written policies and standard industry practice, refinery manager <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Banducci </PERSON> said. He said he had no explanation for the deviation from established procedures and EPA requirements. `` While the investigation is continuing, the management of this refinery takes full responsibility'' for the accident, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Munger </PERSON> said Thursday. The practice of discharging the storm water without inspection was not followed at any of the 173 other tanks at the 1,000-acre refinery, said <PERSON> Banducci </PERSON>. `` In our view, leaving the valve open when rain is predicted is not control -LRB- of rain discharges -RRB- in any sense of the word,'' <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> said Thurssday. About 126,000 gallons of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> crude, a particularly thick oil, have been recovered from a 15-mile stretch along <LOCATION> Carquinez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, which adjoins the refinery. Crews raced to remove the oil, much of it stuck to rocks and marsh reeds, before rain or an exceptionally high tide of 5.5 feet due on Saturday can spread it. High tides and gusty winds late Wednesday pushed up to 1,600 gallons of oil out of the marsh into the waters of <LOCATION> Suisun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, to the east, and <LOCATION> Carquinez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, northeast of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeze </PERSON>. State Fish and Game Department officials flew over <LOCATION> Ryer </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> islands about six miles from the spill and found `` lots of birds, lots of oil.'' `` Some of the oil has gotten into areas where it was n't before, primarily the nesting areas out there, and that's bad for sure,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, fish and game regional manager. By Thursday morning, 447 oily birds and animals had been picked up from polluted areas, said <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>. Of those, 189 were either dead or died during the rescue. The animals included 32 mammals and eight reptiles. <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> said damaged areas may take a year or more to recover. On Wednesday, wildlife crews blasted gas-powered cannons to frighten birds from nesting marshes and set up `` zon'' guns, propane gas-powered cannons, to scare birds away from fouled areas. About 50 members of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> were sent to help clean up the <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Marina </PERSON>, where some 400 boats were trapped in the harbor. Many belonged to fishermen upset they would miss this weekend's fishing. Most of their boats had oil stains on the hulls, and by federal regulations must be cleaned before being allowed out of the marina. Salmon season opens Sunday, and steelhead are spawning in the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.

 A spectacular, 2 -LCB- - mile cavern kept secret for 14 years to prevent vandalism will become the newest natural tourist attraction in the state that's home to the Grand Canyon and the Petrified Forest The Legislature and Gov. Rose Mofford rushed Wednesday to enact legislation allowing the state to acquire the cavern. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> perched a spelunker's helmet atop her beehive hairdo as she signed the bill adopted an hour earlier. Until now, only a select few have squeezed through the tiny opening to see the cavern near <LOCATION> Benson </LOCATION>, in southeastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> about 50 miles from <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Travous </PERSON> predicted Wednesday that when the cave is opened to the public in about three years, 100,000 to 150,000 people a year will travel by elevator to see it. `` It's fabulous,'' <PERSON> Travous </PERSON> said. `` Walt Disney could n't have done any better for the state of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Your imagination goes crazy when you get down there.'' The cave, discovered in 1974, is about 13,000 feet long and from 50 to 100 feet high inside. Thousands of still-growing stalagmites and stalactites ranging in size from several inches to 60 feet are found throughout the two-room cave, which is home to a colony of 700 bats. <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Steenerson </PERSON> said the cavern is considerably smaller than the famous Carlsbad Caverns in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which are among the world's largest at 100,000 feet in length. The national <ORGANIZATION> Cave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> gave 68 points to the quality of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> caverns's formations and rated it as a national-class cave; <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION> received 100 and is rated world-class. Officials plan to use state park revenues to acquire the site for $ 1.6 million within a year from the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservancy </ORGANIZATION>, which soon will buy it from the family of the late <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartchner </PERSON>, a rancher and educator. The cave had been a closely held secret since it was discovered because of fear that vandals would destroy its beauty. `` It's very colorful,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tufts </PERSON>, 39, who with <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenen </PERSON>, 37, who first came across the cavern. `` The variety of formations is very wide.'' Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Arzberger </PERSON>, in whose district the cave lies, said he had `` walked over this thing I do n't know how many times hunting deer'' but never realized its existence. One of <LOCATION> Kartchner </LOCATION>'s sons, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, said family members were aware of the sinkhole on their land. `` We climbed in it, there were rattlesnakes, and we climbed back out -LRB- with -RRB- no idea of the magnificence of the structure,'' <PERSON> Kartchner </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Legislation to bridge the gap between the pending medium-range missile reduction treaty and a future pact to make deep cuts in long-range nuclear arms was introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Thursday. The bill calls for temporary mutual limits on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet deployment of long-range strategic arms until the negotiation of a new Strategic Arms Reduction or START treaty. The legislation declares that the two superpowers should not exceed the levels of specified nuclear weapons they had in the field on Jan. 25, 1988, the date the medium-range accord was submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Both nations would have to agree on such limitations before they could take effect. The bill was introduced by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, D-Ark.; <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said that both supporters and opponents of the pending Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF treaty agree that the military advantages of the pact to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies can be overcome by the Soviets if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deploys additional long-range weapons to make up for the medium-range missiles it will be required to destroy. `` Our legislation provides guidelines for temporary mutual restraints to reinforce the INF treaty until we get a strategic arms agreement, `` Bumpers said. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> added: `` Unless we stop or slow deployment of new Soviet strategic missiles, the INF treaty will be a dead letter.'' `` Without any cap on intercontinental missiles, the Soviets will simply add more strategic warheads to cover the same <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> targets once covered by the SS-20 intermediate-range Soviet missiles,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said it is now clear that no agreement will be reached on a START treaty at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting in late May between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. By calling for an interim freeze on multiple warhead missiles and bombers, the legislation will maintain the viability of the INF treaty pending the achievement of a more far-reaching START treaty, he said. <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> said the treaty will protect the advances made by the INF treaty and improve chances of reaching agreement on cuts in long-range arms.

 <ORGANIZATION> Rite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has canceled its plan to construct an international headquarters here after the city council approved an ordinance requiring companies to offer unpaid leave to new mothers and fathers. The decision by Rite Aid, one of the nation's largest drugstore chains, comes as state legislators begin to review several bills to impose similar requirements statewide. Parental leave legislation is also being considered on the federal level. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Rite Aid, said the company did not object to specific provisions of the city ordinance. The concern of company officials, she said, is that <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> was entering an area `` traditionally covered on federal and state levels.'' The <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> ordinance, approved by the city council Wednesday in a 5-2 override of the mayor's veto, would allow a mother or father to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave after the birth of a child. Supporters of the requirement say it would strengthen families while protecting the jobs of workers who want to take an extended absence. But business groups are concerned such restrictions will interfere with existing benefits and hamper the business climate. A spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, a Democrat, said the city may take legal action to block its provisions. `` Obviously it's a severe blow to us. It's 1,300 jobs,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. The city, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s capital, has a population of about 55,000. Rite Aid, with 28,000 employees worldwide and a number of facilities in suburban <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, planned to move 735 jobs into the new headquarters and add 100 more jobs a year for the following three years. In addition, the project would have created construction jobs. City officials said they knew of no other city that has imposed such a law, but at least 10 states guarantee some form of parental leave, and legislators in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> are considering such a law. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> is against the ordinance, Ms. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said, because `` it singles out <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> _ one municipality _ and it will be detrimental to the business climate which has been improving in the last three or four years.'' City council President <PERSON> Reizdan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the bill's suporters are `` not anti-business We're pro-business, pro-development, pro-people, pro-everything.'' But councilwoman <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said the bill is `` anti-Harrisburg.'' Even the five members of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which must enforce the law, wrote the council a letter urging that the <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION>'s veto be sustained. They said the law would lead to increased discrimination for both young men and women who are interested in starting a family. Some residents who supported the bill said they were enraged by Rite Aid's threatened cancellation. `` If you do n't pass this, you might as well put a sign up ... that says, ` Rite Aid Plantation,'' said <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, one resident. `` I'll tell you this: I wo n't pick cotton here.'' Ms. <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> said Rite Aid had a parental leave policy she described as `` attractive,'' but would not discuss its specific provisions. `` We're responding not to the issue, but -LRB- to -RRB- the right of a municipality to impose such a policy on a local corporation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Cuban troops on alert for enemy planes accidentally shot down one of their own aircraft in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, killing a brigadier general and 25 other military personnel, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military said Thursday. The Cuban news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION>, in a dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, quoted a military communique as saying the `` error of Cuban rocket defense'' took place Wednesday morning as the AN-26 transport plane approached the airport at <LOCATION> Tchamutete </LOCATION>. The Cuban plane's trip had been announced previously. The airport's anti-air defense was on a high state of alert because several enemy planes had been spotted in the area, the news agency said. The communique said that one of the rocket installations on alert fired on the plane as it approached. Thousands of Cuban troops are in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> helping the Marxist government fight an insurgency backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The general who was killed was identified as Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourzac </PERSON>, the deputy minister for armaments and technology. He also was a member of the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a hero of the thwarted Bay of Pigs invasion of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1961, the news agency said It said that Col. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Izquierdo </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinones </PERSON> and a group of anti-aircraft specialists headed by Lt.

<HEAD>Engineered Antibody Cures Diabetes In Laboratory Mice, Says
Researcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An engineered antibody developed to attack a type of immune cell in the body has been shown to cure laboratory mice of diabetes, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> researcher said Thursday. Dr. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said that in an experiment that has lasted for more than a year his team demonstrated that a special monoclonal antibody could block the destructive action of a T-cell lymphocyte that is thought to play a role in causing diabetes. <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON> said the antibody was used in a laboratory animal called the nonobese diabetic mouse. This type of mouse normally develops diabetes and is bred to enable researchers to study the disease. Normally, he said, the mice of this strain develop diabetes within 150 days and die within a short time. But in the Stanford experiment reported in the journal Science, mice treated with the monoclonal antibody were cured of diabetes and all but three have lived for 450 days. Two control groups of mice that were part of the experiment died of diabetes after receiving either none of the antibody or small doses, said <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON>. The scientist said that although the research is promising, it does not offer any immediate hope of curing diabetes in humans. <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON> said the technique must undergo studies in primates before it could be applied to humans even on an experimental basis. Furthermore, <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON> said the treatment would never be appropriate for patients who already have diabetes because by then `` the disease has gone too far in the destructive process.'' The monoclonal antibody used in the research was developed to attack a type of lymphocyte that has on its surface a protein called the L3T4 marker. When injected, the antibody will seek out and kill cells with this marker. Lymphocytes with the L3T4 marker are thought to be the pilot cells in an attack on the pancreas, the organ that secretes insulin. This lymphocyte is thought to start a cascade effect that results in the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas being destroyed by the body's own immune system. Once the beta cells are destroyed, the body can not produce insulin, a hormone essential for the metabolism of sugar. <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON> said his team used three groups of the nonobese diabetic mice. One group received none of the monoclonal antibody. A second group received one large dose of the antibody. The third group received a large dose, plus smaller weekly doses. The experiment began when the mice were 90 to 110 days old. At that point, said <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON>, the destructive process that leads to diabetes was well started, with the beta cells of the pancreas already under attack. By 260 days, 80 percent of both the untreated mice and the mice which received a single dose of the antibody were diabetic or dead. Among the 25 mice that received weekly doses of the antibody, only two were diabetic. <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON> said the treatment may have started too late in the process for these two mice. A third mouse in the treated group died later of other causes. All treatment was withdrawn 150 days after it started and the fully-treated mice remain healthy. <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the treated mice now have passed the age of 450 days and are maintaining normal levels of sugar in their blood, evidence that they are not diabetic. `` We clearly have prevented them from reverting to the diabetic state,'' he said. `` They are cured.'' <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON> and his co-workers reported on the experiment in Science, the journal of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Science. The magazine was published Friday.

<HEAD>CIA Heads Off North Korean Attempt To Buy Computers, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> tried to buy hundreds of Japanese computers through a company in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> last month, but <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents foiled the plan, a news agency said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, quoting unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, also said <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents were monitoring North Korean trade representatives in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to block possible terrorist actions at the Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> quoted the sources as saying <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents discovered in March that 500 computers ordered from a Japanese trading company for export to a company in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, were destined for communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The news agency said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> notified <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> through diplomatic channels, and the ministry subsequently denied the trading company an export permit for the computers. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said the names of the companies involved were not available. Japanese trade ministry and <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said they could not comment on the reports of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> or North Korean involvement. They said a distributor for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a major computer maker, had received an order from a small company in the western city of <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION> for 500 to 600 personal computers. The Kobe company had received an order for the computers from a small Japanese trading company in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, which in turn had received an order from a firm in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, the ministry officials told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. They spoke on condition they not be identified. They said <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>'s distributor canceled the deal before an application was made to the trade ministry for an export permit. An <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Seiji </PERSON> <PERSON> Igarashi </PERSON>, confirmed an <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> distributor had received an order last fall from a Japanese trading company for about 500 personal computers. He said the distributor canceled the deal this spring when it could not confirm the ultimate source of the order. Japanese companies and government officials have tightened their monitoring of high-technology exports to communist countries since a <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary was found last year to have violated Japanese and international trade regulations by selling sophisticated metal milling machines to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday called on federal regulators to dissolve within 60 days a much-criticized agency created 2 -LCB- years ago to sell property from insolvent savings institutions. After meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> members of the committee, Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, decided to send a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> calling for the speedy abolishment of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said a committee spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity. Two members of the committee, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON>, D-Md., and Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON>, D-Pa., are drafting legislation to dismantle <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> should Wall refuse to comply, the spokeswoman Wall spokesman <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said the bank board, which regulates 3,147 federally insured savings institutions, is unlikely to do away with <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>. `` We'd be the first to admit there were problems, but we have those problems under control. We've got new management at <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> and we believe it should have an opportunity to prove itself,'' he said. In another development, the new chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, said the agency made its first quarterly profit during the first three months of this year. `` We will be posting a net profit of $ 538,000 for the first quarter. The loss last year was approximately $ 7 million and the year before that $ 3 million,'' he said. `` I do n't want to make more of it than it is, but I think it is kind of a turning point.'' The move to abolish <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats comes less than a week after the release of a highly critical report by the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that charged <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> with being a `` bloated bureaucracy'' that wasted millions of dollars. The bank board created <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> in late 1985 by chartering it as a private savings institution. Despite that structure, it functions as an arm of the government and all of its stock is owned by the insurance fund that backs S & amp; L deposits. The insurance fund is also <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>'s only customer, paying it fees to manage loans and real estate from insolvent S & amp; Ls.

<TEXT>
 Defense attorneys at the racketeering trial of Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> tried to link Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday while cross-examining a witness. The witness, former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorten </PERSON>, testified that he was told the company hired a distant relative of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s as a management consultant partly `` because of his contact with the vice president.'' But Shorten denied that <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, related to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by marriage, was hired to win <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s obtaining a multimillion-dollar <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract Shorten also said he was told by a close friend of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would have President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> overrule the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> if it did not give the contract to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, which is now bankrupt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman, confirmed that <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> is related to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> through marriage but said the vice president had nothing to do with contracts. `` We have no records of any type of involvement or any action involving <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contracts that would suggest the vice president took any position one way or another,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> `` did write the vice president five or six letters.'' But he added: `` The vice president either did n't respond to the letters or in the cases where he did respond, they were very cursory responses, ` thanks for note, and so forth,' and alluded to little if anything in the letters.'' Shorten, one of four former top <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives who have pleaded guilty to state and federal charges _ now cooperating with the government in exchange for leniency _ said <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was vying with companies in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to win a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract to build floating docks, or pontoons, in 1984. He said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supported the other companies, but he denied an allegation by <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> was hired `` to countermand the problems that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was giving <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>.'' Shorten said he did not think the vice president's relative was still working for the defense contractor in 1984, when the pontoon contract was up for grabs. `` But you did get the contract, right?'' persisted <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON>. `` Yes,'' said Shorten. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> obtained the first of several <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pontoon contracts totaling more than $ 100 million in April 1984. In a telephone interview from his <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, home, <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> said that he stopped working for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in the fall of 1981 but that payment for his consulting services was strung out until early 1984. <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did anything on <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s behalf `` I'm not aware of it.'' He added: `` If they had any influence with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> I did n't get it for them.'' <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s busy schedule has kept them from speaking since 1980. <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> also denied speaking or writing to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s pontoon contract but said he did write the vice president at least twice on the company's behalf about an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> engine contract in 1981 <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democrat, and six others are accused of turning <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, which is now bankrupt, into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to obtain no-bid government contracts. Defense lawyers have tried to show that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials had close links to high-ranking officials in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House and thus did not need the help of a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. Shorten said <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> sought the help of such <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insiders as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a close friend and former personal lawyer to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. `` You know sir,'' asked <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> `` that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had an open door to the White House through his buddy <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, right?'' `` Yes, sir,'' said Shorten. `` He told you that did n't he?'' `` Yes, he did,'' said Shorten. Later, <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> asked if <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had told Shorten `` that if the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> did n't give you, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, the pontoon contract, he would make sure through <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that the ` old man,' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, would overrule the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and give it to you, right?'' `` He did say that, yes,'' said Shorten. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> is under indictment on charges of taking payoffs from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other public officials. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has not been charged with any wrongdoing.

 A wind-whipped fire raced through a shantytown Thursday, destroying the homes of thousands of poor people who desperately fought the flames with buckets of water. Troops were sent to the area after residents, angry that firefighters were not saving their homes, pelted firetrucks with stones. The wood and cardboard shantytown had no fire hydrants and officials said the roads were too narrow for the trucks. There was no immediate estimate of damage and the cause of the fire was under investigation. The city's fire chief, Chief Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Madriaga </PERSON>, said the blaze was `` possibly the biggest in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> since World War II.'' Four people were injured, including three civilians and a fireman who was struck in the head by a water hose, <PERSON> Madriaga </PERSON> said. Firefighters controlled the blaze at 7:30 p.m., 4 -LCB- hours after it began in the capital's crowded <LOCATION> Pandacan </LOCATION> district. Smoke blackened the skies over much of the city Thursday afternoon. The fire threatened to spread to a government-owned petroleum compound, but did not reach it because of a change in the wind. Hundreds of people huddled around collections of personal belongings, including refrigerators, furniture and televisions sets, on the sides of a narrow, mud-covered street separating the smoldering shantytown from the petroleum compound. The fire broke out an hour after firefighters put out a blaze that gutted the top floor of the nine-story, 60-room <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apartment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> about two miles away. No one was injured in that fire, which officials said began in an adjacent building under construction. The hotel's manager said most of the 100 guests were out at the time. The government-run <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 3,000 families, or approximately 15,000 people, lost their homes in <LOCATION> Pandacan </LOCATION>, on the banks of the <LOCATION> Pasig </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about 1 -LCB- miles from the presidential palace. <PERSON> Madriaga </PERSON> estimated more than 1,000 dwellings in the 25-acre area were destroyed along with a candy factory warehouse. Major oil companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Caltex </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> and the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have storage tanks in the area. <PERSON> Madriaga </PERSON>'s deputy, Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON>, said the flames came within eight yards of the oil complex. Firefighters said they could not use their firetrucks in the shantytown and they concentrated on preventing the fire from spreading to the oil depot. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, operations manager of the depot, said the squatter area was `` too congested for even the best firefighters to have been able to battle the flames very well.'' He said water had to be pumped from hydrants within the oil compound. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayani </PERSON>, 27, whose home was destroyed, said she was attending a Bible study class about 3 p.m. when she heard children shouting `` Fire, fire.'' After gathering her three small children, `` I saved our clothes and some kitchen utensils,'' she said. `` But we have no rice and no money.'' `` We will stay here during the night,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bayani </PERSON> added. `` But I do n't know what we will do tomorrow.''

 An assassination team of two masked men fired blasts from a sawed-off shotgun Thursday to kill <PERSON> Agop </PERSON> <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON>, the founder and leader of an Armenian terrorist group feared throughout the world. <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON>, who posed as a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> businessman in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> but also carried a South Yemeni diplomatic passport, was shot outside his home in a prosperous seaside suburb. A statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> said the victim's wife, `` during questioning by security police ... said he was the leader of <LOCATION> ASALA </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Agop </PERSON> <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON>. Police identified the wife as <PERSON> Janil </PERSON> <PERSON> Titizian </PERSON> and said she told them her husband recently arrived from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> and was on his way to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. She said he was bound for the airport when killed. <LOCATION> ASALA </LOCATION>, standing for the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenia </ORGANIZATION>, has claimed numerous terrorist attacks against Turkish targets, including the July 1983 bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> Turkish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> desk at <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' Orly Airport which killed eight people and wounded 56. The group seeks the foundation of an independent Armenian state in eastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the killing. <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> was killed outside his house in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phaleron </LOCATION> suburb at 4:30 a.m. -LRB- 9:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday -RRB- as he waited for a taxi in the street outside his home. With him was a woman identified as his sister-in-law. She was unhurt. According to a police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance with Greek practice, two armed men emerged from a parked car. One man fired at Agopian, using solid shotgun slugs, the type used in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> for boar-hunting. <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON>, hit with two slugs in the chest and elbow, tried to flee. The man ran after him and fired two more slugs into his head and chest. The attackers got away in a car left parked across the street from the second-floor apartment where <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> and his wife lived. The victim was first identified as <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kashim </PERSON>, 39, from a South Yemeni diplomatic passport he was carrying. But following reports from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> saying the dead man was the long-sought leader of <LOCATION> ASALA </LOCATION>, the ministry said his wife revealed his real identity. `` He'd lived in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> for at least a year, possibly longer, as <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Titizian </PERSON>, but he traveled abroad very frequently on the <LOCATION> Yemeni </LOCATION> passport,'' said a police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The source said <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> planned to open a supermarket in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON>, whose name has also been given as <PERSON> Hagop </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagopian </PERSON>, was reported killed in an Israeli air raid on a Palestinian camp near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> during <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 summer invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But there were also reports that <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> was still alive and active in the terrorist organization he had founded, and had merely changed identities. Armenian sources in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anoymity, said <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in 1945, and that his name was most likely a pseudonym. <LOCATION> ASALA </LOCATION>, founded by <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> in 1975, claimed responsibility for more than 60 attacks on Turkish targets, including killings of around 30 Turkish diplomats and dependents in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> ran ASALA from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with funding from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and leftist groups. Besides seeking the creation of an independent Armenian state in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the Marxist-oriented organization vows to avenge a massacre by Ottoman Turks in 1915-16 that it says left 1.5 Armenians dead. Both security police and ministry officials declined to say whether a rival Armenian group could have been responsible for killing <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON>. The French news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France-Presse </ORGANIZATION> reported in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that Thursday's killing may have been the work of the <ORGANIZATION> ASALA-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, an Armenian commando group which separated from the main organization. The head of that group, American archaeologist <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Melkonian </PERSON>, is serving a six-year term in French prison for criminal association, weapons possession and forging identity papers. The ministry said security police were still questioning Mrs. <PERSON> Titizian </PERSON>. A police source said <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> `` apparently was selling off some businesses in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and was transferring his activities to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.'' The police spokesman said <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> was booked on an early morning <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>.

 A fire broke out in the crew quarters of the USS Bonefish before the submarine was wracked by explosions and fire that killed three crewmen, a survivor of the accident said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has refused to speculate on the cause of Sunday's accident off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast, but civilian submarine experts have said the explosion could have been connected with a buildup of hydrogen gas in the battery compartments <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>, the chief electrician's mate, said there was a `` small fire in berthing, and a couple of people manned fire extinguishers and attempted to put it out.'' He said there were initial reports that the fire was under control, then reports the fire was spreading. `` From everybody I talked to there was an explosion later, maybe five minutes down the road,'' he said. `` I never heard the explosion, being so far aft.'' Crew members had donned gas masks and made an orderly evacuation despite thick, poisonous smoke, he said. The sub's emergency lights `` hardly did any good because of the density of the smoke,'' <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> said. No one was available for comment on <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>'s account, an officer at fleet headquarters said Thursday night. Telephone calls to four spokesmen at home went unanswered or were not returend. The 219-foot Bonefish, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s four remaining diesel-electric subs, was cruising at periscope depth Sunday when the first explosion hit its forward battery compartment, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said earlier. The batteries are used to power the sub when it is below the surface. Recharging those batteries generates hydrogen gas, which can explode if allowed to accumulate. After the explosions began, the Bonefish was able to surface 160 miles east of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and Cmdr. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 42, ordered the 92-member crew evacuated because of smoke and toxic fumes, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. Two of the 89 survivors remained hospitalized Thursday. <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> disputed speculation that high levels of hydrogen in the battery compartments may have been responsible for the explosion. `` I know for a fact we had zero percent hydrogen in the battery well,'' he said. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said earlier that preliminary indications pointed toward a series of explosions aboard the sub, including one in the battery compartment. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that bodies of two of the three sailors had been removed from the submarine, which was being towed by the salvage ship USS Hoist to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, its home port. <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Bellows </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, said he was in the engineering section when the fire filled the craft with thick smoke. `` Before I left, I held the flashlight up to my mask and you could n't tell if it was on or off,'' he said. The evacuation was orderly, however, he said. `` There were no reports of anybody grabbing somebody by the waist so they could go first,'' he said. Because crewmen were at their stations about 20 minutes before they evacuated, they probably had time to become familiar with their location, even in the dark, he said. The three victims were were relatively new to the crew, on board four or five weeks, and may have been doomed by a lack of familiarity with the craft's layout, <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> said. The Bonefish, although `` running great'' at the time of the accident, had a reputation for breaking down and not getting under way on time because of its age, he said. Rep. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member whose district includes the naval base, said he had dismissed what he called rumors that the Bonefish was not seaworthy. <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> had told him the Bonefish was overhauled four years ago and its batteries were replaced two years ago. A crewman told <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> station <ORGANIZATION> WCIV </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that the ship had been running fine before the accident. `` It was totally safe,'' said <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolby </PERSON>. `` It was in the best shape I'd see it in the two years I've been on the ship.'' Another member of the crew, Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Okolona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said Bonefish personnel were schooled in handling emergencies. `` The crew acted in the best way possible. We train every day, and this is where it paid off,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowery </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> the remains of Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Everts </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Naoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordelon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 39, of <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, were transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> late Wednesday The body of Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, 21, of <ORGANIZATION> Pisgah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, will be removed with the assistance of a medical team from the aircraft carrier <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> before the ship reaches <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> leaves Saturday for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, where he faces a storm of criticism over a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member's remark that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was not the aggressor in World War II. <PERSON> Seisuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, angered the Chinese and other Asians last week when he visited a Japanese war memorial and said that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was simply defending itself in World War II. He said his country `` fought to protect itself at a time when the white race had turned <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> into a colony.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON>, said Wednesday `` it's astonishing and very regrettable to us that a minister of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> made such discourteous remarks in this regard of historical facts.'' A spokesman for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> will not apologize for <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>'s remarks during his trip. `` This is not a matter of policy from the official stand of the government, rather the personal comment of one Cabinet member,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Yoshifumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON>. `` I do n't think Mr. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> is going to make any sort of formal apology.'' However, he also acknowledged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had a responsibility in the war. `` We are responsible for a lot of aggressiveness on our part, not only in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but elsewhere,'' he said. `` No one in Japanese society doubts this, except a very small amount of extremists, which you have in any society.'' Although he did not apologize, <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON> later said he was sorry that his remarks were criticized by the Chinese media and he acknowledged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> caused major damage to its neighbors during World War II, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> said there were no plans to dismiss <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>. Education Minister <PERSON> Masayuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujio </PERSON>, a member of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s Cabinet, was fired after he said <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was partly responsible for its annexation by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1910, and said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s actions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during World War II were justified. During his trip, Uno will visit <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a meeting of Chinese and Japanese officials opened Thursday with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> criticizing <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>'s remarks. <PERSON> Huan </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiang </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON> was trying to cover up <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s history There were also strong reactions to <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>'s comments in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The pro-government <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> said in an editorial: `` If there were a prize for political hogwash ... Mr. <PERSON> Seiuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON> would win it hands down.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> called the remarks `` an insult to human conscience.'' In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the independent <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Hankook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial that the remark showed the Japanese have `` a sense of superiority based on their economic success.''

 A woman was sentenced to life in prison Thursday for killing a pregnant woman and cutting the baby out with a car key. <PERSON> Darci </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, 20, was found guilty but mentally ill last month of murder, kidnapping and child abuse in the slaying of <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 23, who was 8 -LCB- months' pregnant. The verdict meant the jury believed Mrs. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was mentally ill when she committed the crimes but did not meet the legal test for insanity. Prosecutors contended that Mrs. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was desperate for a child and told her husband, an airman at <ORGANIZATION> Kirtland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, that she was pregnant and that she was going to have labor induced July 23. She waited outside a prenatal care clinic at the base that day and abducted Mrs. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, the first nearly full-term pregnant woman to walk out, prosecutors said. Mrs. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> drove to the mountains east of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, where she strangled Mrs. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> and cut the baby from her body with a key. The infant, named <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON>, survived. Mrs. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was arrested after she went to an <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> hospital with a newborn girl and doctors determined she had not given birth. Mrs. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, has returned to his home state of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> with the infant girl and her 2-year-old brother. Following testimony of two psychiatrists Thursday, state District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Traub </PERSON> ordered concurrent sentences of life in prison for murder, 18 years for kidnapping and 18 months for child abuse. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> recommended consecutive sentences, calling the killing a `` gruesome, heinous crime that was premeditated.'' `` It's impossible to counterbalance the pain <PERSON> Darci </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> placed on the <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> family,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers failed in an initial round of talks Thursday to reach agreement on a proposal to cut oil exports in conjunction with non-OPEC producers, cartel leaders said. After a nearly four-hour session that ended early Friday, the 13 ministers said they would resume their closed-door deliberations Friday evening. <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> president of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, said the ministers had discussed the export-cutting plan `` in general terms, but nothing specific was decided.'' The proposed reductions, in combination with cuts by six non-OPEC oil exporting countries, are designed to push up oil prices and codify a new spirit of cooperation among oil producers. The six independent producers on Wednesday said they would cut oil exports by 5 percent for two months if the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> did likewise. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, however, is divided over how to respond to the offer, which is the first such proposal from rival producers since the oil cartel was formed in 1960. Oil prices on the open market fell Thursday. Brent crude from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> dropped as low as $ 16.90 a barrel before closing at $ 17.20 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, down 30 cents from Wednesday. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the June contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, fell 29 cents to close at $ 17.98 a barrel. The contract lost 33 cents on Wednesday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> strongly supports the non-OPEC proposal, both as a way of strengthening the oil market and as a step toward closer ties with non-OPEC producers. `` Any measures and means that can lead to this would be supported by us,'' the Iranian oil minister, <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aghazadeh </PERSON>, told reporters on his arrival from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members, including <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, take a more cautious view. They want to encourage outside producers to restrain their oil output, but they see little merit in the terms of the proposal under consideration in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Saudi King Fahd, meanwhile, reiterated his view that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> can get prices up simply by sticking to its existing agreement on production restraints. He did not comment directly on the non-OPEC offer. `` I believe prices will go up if we adhere to the output ceiling and convince non-OPEC producers of the feasibility of limiting their production,'' he was quoted as saying in an interview published Thursday by a Kuwaiti newspaper. Officials from the non-OPEC countries were not attending Thursday's cartel meeting, so there was to be no direct negotiating between the two groups. The offer from the non-OPEC producers _ <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> _ states that they will cut their exports by 5 percent from the average level over the past six months. They said this amounted to about 200,000 barrels a day. The cuts would be for May and June only. A 5 percent cut by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> from its current level of exports would amount to about 700,000 barrels a day. Together with the 200,000 barrels to be cut by the outsider producers, this could have a significant impact on the market, analysts said. But it appeared increasingly clear that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would not cut by as much as proposed, sources in several delegations said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The cartel easily could argue that a much smaller reduction would fulfill the terms of the outsiders' proposal, which says only that a 5 percent cut by non-OPEC is conditioned on `` a similar proportional response by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>.'' If <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> based its 5 percent cut on an average level of exports over the past six months _ as the non-OPEC countries had done _ then <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would have to cut only about 200,000 barrels a day from its actual present rate of exports. This is because <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s exports were substantially higher in the latter part of 1987. A cut of 200,000 barrels a day by both groups would have little or no impact on the balance between oil supply and demand, said <PERSON> Bahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Karbassioun </PERSON>, a Vienna-based oil consultant and a former <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> staffer. `` It would have only a symbolic impact,'' he said.

 The Sandinista government proposed on Thursday that the two-month cease-fire be extended by 30 days to allow negotiators to work out an enduring peace with rebels, but the rebels immediately said no. <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the rebels, known as the Contras, said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> proposal `` shows they lack good will.'' She noted in a telephone interview that the current cease-fire expires at the end of May, and said that `` if they want to extend it -LRB- the cease-fire -RRB- they can propose it then.'' Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the defense minister and the leader of the leftist government's delegation to the peace talks, told reporters such an extension `` will help improve the conditions under which the negotiations are taking place so that an overall agreement can be discussed to reach a final accord.'' The 60-day provisional truce, which started April 1, is part of an agreement reached by the U.S.-backed rebels and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> at the southern border post of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> on March 23. During the truce the two sides are to attempt to negotiate an end to the 6 -LCB- - year-old conflict that has cost more than 26,000 lives, by government estimates <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the brother of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, announced the offer shortly before the delegations resumed high-level political talks. The government also offered Thursday to let the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> administer humanitarian aid immediately to the Contras even before rebel combatants gather inside safe zones established during previous talks. The Sandinista proposal was read by Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, who said the offer was `` an attempt to facilitate the pacification process.'' Sandinista and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> negotiators previously agreed upon seven safe zones in which the Contra fighters are to collect. The two sides differed over operational conditions inside the zones, however, and the rebels have yet to gather inside them. The three-day negotiating session marks only the second time the two sides have met in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> since the war began in 1981. Recent reports have said that the Contra leadership is divided, with the rebel military commanders opposing any immediate agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Wednesday predicted an agreement can be reached if both sides bargain in good faith. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the Contras remain far apart on essential issues. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused the rebel commanders of taking part in the talks `` not with the purpose of reaching agreement'' but to buy time. American and other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said rebel leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> tried unsuccessfully to oust the top rebel military commander, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, a week ago. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the Contra directors split 2-2 with one abstention on whether to remove <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>. He ostensibly takes orders from the five-member civilian directorate but believes he should have more influence over rebel decisions, the sources said. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> argues that civilian control over the movement is essential and sees <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> as a threat to that objective. In an effort to dispel rumors of disunity, <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> and other Contra leaders issued a statement in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Wednesday declaring support for the talks. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, in a telephone interview Thursday, denied there was any split in rebel ranks. `` There are obviously sectors who would be interested in there being such a split,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Just in time for the parched tourist season, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Thursday to let pubs stay open all afternoon. The changes in English licensing laws, the first in 71 years, promise a minor revolution in national drinking habits. Since World War I, pubs have had to send patrons packing and shut their doors at midafternoon _ about the time the weary, thirsty tourist thinks of settling into a pint of English beer and giving his feet a rest. When the changes go into effect by summer, pubs will be allowed to stay open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day but Sunday. Under current law, the hours are 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. or 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.. One controversial amendment which slipped by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> extends Sunday drinking by one hour Pubs will still have to close Sunday afternoons, but will now be open from noon to 3 p.m., insted of 2 p.m.. As now, they will then shut down until 7 p.m. and close for the day at 10:30 p.m The 1916 Licensing Law that shut pubs down after lunch was aimed at curbing drinking by World War I munitions workers. The new hours, to become law after the formality of the queen's approval, will be in effect in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> has separate licensing laws. No date has been stated for implementing the new hours. Organizations of consumers, tourists and brewers applaud the changes, but some people say it will cause excessive drinking and will be tiring for pub staff. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has said it feared an upsurge in alcohol-related illness and road accidents. The Sunday clause, opposed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government, was an amendment introduced last week into the unelected House of Lords It was brought to the floor, and when the presiding officer asked if there were objections, Home Office Minister Lord <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrers </PERSON>, in accordance with procedure for opposing measures in the Lords, shouted `` Not content!'' He expected to be joined by other Conservative lords, but they missed their cues and because no one spoke up a second time the amendment, by procedure, was deemed to have been approved.

 The Soviet Union accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials on Thursday of slowing work on a treaty to halve superpower arsenals of strategic nuclear arms. `` Rather than cooling down the delegations at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> we must do our utmost in the spriit of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> accord to intensify efforts to work out the treaty,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said at a regular news briefing. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet delegations are working in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on a treaty that would cut nuclear arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles, but officials have said numerous differences remain.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday passed a billion-dollar AIDS information and research bill that calls for mandatory AIDS testing of people convicted of sex and drug crimes. `` Finally, we have declared war on the virus and not on the victims in our battle against AIDS,'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said after the 87-4 vote The vote came after hours of bitter argument over the content of educational materials paid for with federal dollars. Tempers were lost, curses hurled and senators denied the opportunity to speak as lawmakers debated whether to renew a 1987 ban on federally funded materials that directly promote or encourage homosexuality. The ban, which expires Sept. 30, was passed last year 94-2. But sentiment shifted this year after several senators said it was having a chilling effect on public health efforts in the homosexual community, which has the highest percentage of AIDS victims. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the ban sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, but also agreed to another provision that says education materials should stress the public health benefits of abstinence, a single monogamous relationship and avoidance of intravenous drug use. The provision also says no other part of the bill should restrict the dissemination of accurate information to anyone at risk, apparently superseding the Helms ban. In addition to voting unanimously to approve mandatory AIDS testing of people convicted of sex and drug crimes, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also accepted neutralized versions of several conservative amendments that supporters said would have hampered the bill. Sens. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, sponsors of the fiscal 1988 research and education bill, called it the nation's first comprehensive statement of an AIDS policy. The two are chairman and ranking minority member, respectively, of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The bill authorizes $ 665 million for state and federal AIDS education programs, increased hiring at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, a new home health care program for AIDS victims and special efforts to help high-risk minorities and intravenous drug abusers. A committee aide said open-ended research money would bring to total to about $ 1.1 billion in annual spending. The bill's passage also was lauded by <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Basile </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the national political action committee for the gay and lesbian community. `` We wanted to say how delighted we were with the final passage ... which for the first time establishes a national policy on AIDS,'' <PERSON> Basile </PERSON> said. `` With respect to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and his attempts to make war on people who are sick, we're happy that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has decided overwhelmingly to make war on a disease instead.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a bill covering research on AIDS is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s health subcommittee. Bills covering the other areas included in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill have not be introduced. The 97-0 vote on a testing amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., marked the first time <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has ventured into uncharted areas of AIDS testing and confidentiality The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration announced last year it would test new immigrants and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> later put its stamp of approval on the policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> tests all 2.1 million men and women on active military duty as well as all recruit applicants and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said last October that it would test some federal prisoners. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure, anyone convicted of a state or federal crime related to sex or intravenous drugs, carrying a penalty of death or at least a year in prison, would be tested. Results would be confidential but could be disclosed to prison wardens or victims of sex crimes. Homosexuals and intravenous drug users have been the chief victims of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which attacks the body's immune system and is spread through blood, blood products or semen. As of April 21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 59,500 Americans, of whom more than half, or about 33,000 have died since June 1981, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said several senators on Wednesday had viewed a federally funded videotape used in the homosexual community and became `` sick to their stomachs. It had explicit instructions about how to engage in homosexual activity. It had two men doing it.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> contended 95 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> would agree with the ban on federally funded materials that promote or encourage homosexuality. But his amendment was challenged by a fellow conservative, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, who said public health efforts ought not exclude the group affected most by AIDS. `` We have to tell homosexuals more than simply to become heterosexuals,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> told <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. `` At least if they wo n't or ca n't become heterosexuals, we can encourage them to abstain from promiscuous sexual activities. It just makes sense. This will decrease their risk and maybe even more importantly the risk to all the rest of the people in our country and throughout the world.'' Responded <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>: `` We're in the business of creating fig leaves in this place.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> succeeded in weakening an earlier <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment that would have banned federal funds for clean-needle programs. Under such programs, drug addicts receive the clean needles in exchange for shared, dirty needles that may be contaminated with the AIDS virus. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> twice rejected the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> version of the plan but approved by voice vote a compromise that bans such use of federal money unless the surgeon general deems the programs effective in stopping drug abuse or the spread of AIDS among addicts. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> called the Helms clean-needle amendments `` poorly crafted political mischief ... being thrown out as no more than a harassing technique'' against a popular bill. He said it is much too early to decide that needle-exchange programs do n't work and should n't be used. But <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> condemned the compromise, saying Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> has already said the programs may be a good idea. `` It's just a matter of time'' before federal money is spent on them, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> also derailed another amendment that would have required state certification that no AIDS patient would be denied routine nutrition or hydration if that would lead to death. `` This amendment vigorously protects the rights of AIDS victims,'' said <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, sponsor of the measure. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, after nearly three hours of discussion, instead approved, 60-36, a Kennedy substitute asking the congressional biomedical ethics board to study the problem as it relates to patients with any disease. Those senators voting against the AIDS bill were <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo.; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION> Not voting on the bill were Sens. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del.; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash.; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>; <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>, D-Miss; <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>

 A woman accused of killing her husband and another woman with cyanide-laced <ORGANIZATION> Excedrin </ORGANIZATION> wrote a bank five days before his death to say the couple's money problems would soon be over, a prosecutor said Thursday. But under cross-examination by Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maida </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> denied telling <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigators that she expected to benefit from the 1986 death of <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 52. `` I told them I did n't expect to benefit at all because money was not important to me. My husband was. I would have sooner had him than any amount of money,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> said. The 44-year-old Auburn woman is accused of five instances of tampering with over-the-counter medicine, including two cases involving deaths, in the first such death-by-tampering ever to go to trial in this country. Both the defense and the prosecution rested their cases later Thursday, and closing arguments were scheduled for Monday. Prosecutors charge Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> plotted the death of her husband to collect $ 176,000 in insurance benefits and put other tainted pain-relievers on the shelves of area drugstores to make the tampering appear random. Sue <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION> also died in June 1986 after swallowing cyanide-laced Excedrin. If convicted, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> could face life in prison. Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> called a rebuttal witness who said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, told her of Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s plans in November 1985, more than seven months before <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> died The witness, <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, her former roommate, told her, `` <PERSON> Katy </PERSON>, do you know what my mother just said to me? She asked me how much cocaine it would take to kill a person.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> `` said that her mother had been talking about getting rid of her father. ... She was getting tired of him,'' Ms. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> had testified Tuesday that her mother had discussed putting cocaine in <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s iced tea to make his death look like an overdose. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, asked Wednesday if she had ever told her daughter that she intended to poison her husband with cyanide, or that she had attempted to kill her husband, replied, `` No.'' Earlier Thursday, under questioning by Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> confirmed that she and her husband owed three banks and an investment company $ 8,553 in April and May of 1986, but she denied that their financial situation was getting worse. On April 25, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> wrote one bank that she was having `` marriage problems'' that would soon be solved. Five days before <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s death, she wrote the same bank that `` my payments will now stay current,'' <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s attorney, public defender <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON>, ended his examination of her by asking if she killed her husband. `` No I did not,'' she answered in an steady voice. `` The thought never entered my mind and never would because I loved <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> too much,'' she said. `` There's no way I'd ever think of getting rid of him.'' <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> also asked her if she tried to copy the unsolved Tylenol tampering case in which seven people died in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area in 1982. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> denied that accusation, raised by her daughter in earlier testimony, as well as claims she planned to leave her husband. Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> had Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> read passages about cyanide from `` Deadly Harvest,'' a library book Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> borrowed in 1983 and 1984. The book dealt with poisons and poisonous plants. `` Cyanide is often employed as the lethal substance in murder mysteries,'' <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> read slowly as a packed courtroom and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court jury listened. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> denied taking notes from `` Deadly Harvest'' when Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said some of Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s 87 fingerprints found in the book were cut off by a straight line, as if by a piece of notebook paper. During her testimony Wednesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> tearfully told of watching <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> collapse, saying she never knew he was dying. `` Babe, I feel like I'm going to pass out,'' she quoted her husband as saying before he collapsed at their home June 5, 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> described her husband as a loving, good-natured man with a sense of humor. She denied telling family members her marriage was unhappy or that their periodic financial stresseshad threatened their marriage. Prosecutors allege she forged her husband's signature on insurance paperwork. But she said signed the forms with his permission because he `` despised paperwork.''

<HEAD>Elite West German School Shaken by Sex and Alcohol Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALEM, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For more than 60 years, <ORGANIZATION> Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> has quietly educated <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s elite, including <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Golo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, the historian and son of Nobel Prize novelist <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>. But the count who lives in a castle next door here in tranquil foothills near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Constance </LOCATION> has accused Salem's officials of permitting widespread sexual misconduct and alcohol abuse among its teen-age students. The officials call the charges baseless and say the school is a victim of a vicious assault by <PERSON> Count </PERSON> <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Baden </PERSON>, whose family owns the school property. `` These charges are only a pretext for what is in reality his bitter fight to gain control of the school,'' <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueb </PERSON>, the school's director, said in an interview He added that relations between school authorities and the count soured in 1980 when a pregnant, unmarried teacher was allowed to stay on. A similar case in 1984 further fueled the count's displeasure with the school, he said In a so far unsuccessful legal bid to evict the school from the property, the count has cited alleged examples of sexual encounters between students on school grounds and alcohol and drug abuse as proof that <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> is no longer fulfilling its mission. He claimed former students recounted allegations that boys had used pass keys to enter girls' dormitories and that hashish had been found on school grounds in 1985. The count also maintained that the school has become too progressive and has strayed from the educational precepts of its founder, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a Jew who presided over the school until he was forced to flee Nazi persecution in 1933. <ORGANIZATION> Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1920 by <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and Prince <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Baden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Count </PERSON> <PERSON> Max </PERSON>'s grandfather. The prince allowed the school to use the grounds and buildings of a medieval monastery and was its benefactor until his death in 1929. The von <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> family remained directly involved in the school until 1959, when the count's father declared it independent of family control. Since then, the family's involvement has been largely ceremonial, with only a rental agreement binding it to the school. The agreement expires in 1999. <PERSON> Golo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, who attended <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> in 1923-27, said recently he `` has no regrets and looks back fondly'' on his four years there. `` It was a little Spartan, but it strengthened my character.'' Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> entered the school in 1933, in the last days of its leadership under <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> fled and founded a new school in <LOCATION> Gordonstoun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, in 1934, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> remained his pupil there. The prince later sent his sons <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Gordonstoun </LOCATION> school, which is run on the same stringent principles as the <ORGANIZATION> Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. When Queen <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> attended the <ORGANIZATION> Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> as a princess of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 1951-55, it was run by an uncle on her mother's side. `` She enjoyed attending the school, and has been back on several occasions to visit,'' said a retired administrator of the school. Today, <ORGANIZATION> Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> has 242 pupils 14 to 17 years old. Tuition averages about $ 16,500 a year. Students stroll across manicured castle grounds to classes in restored 13th-century buildings, all under the watchful and critical eye of the count, who lives in an 18th-century Baroque castle next door. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s founding and guiding principle for the school was the conviction that the body and character must be developed as well as the mind. Smoking, alcohol and sexual contact were forbidden. Each day began with a morning jog. Every student was required to wear a uniform, exercise and take two cold showers a day. The uniforms are gone now, and so are the cold showers. The morning jog remains, but the oldest students are allowed to smoke off campus and congregate on weekends in local pubs approved by school officials. `` Society and education have changed since our school was founded,'' <PERSON> Bueb </PERSON> said. He denied the count's charges that a permissive atmosphere had led students to run amok in sexual and alcoholic excess. `` Of course there have been instances when students have had too much to drink or have been caught having relations at the school,'' <PERSON> Bueb </PERSON> said. `` But the count makes it look like this sort of thing happens every day, when in fact his examples stem from incidents that occurred over 12 years.'' <PERSON> Bueb </PERSON> said pupils found to be drunk must perform 20 hours of work and that those caught with illegal drugs are immediately expelled. A 1986 decision by an abitration court found insufficient evidence to warrant granting the count's request to immediately terminate the school's lease. A court in Constance recently upheld the ruling. But the count has said he would seek a new arbitration hearing, this time to impose hefty rent increases, and renewed demands that the school vacate the property. He said he wants to use the property for his own school that `` will again conform to <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s priniciples.''

 Some foreign embassies are cashing in on the high value of real estate in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is selling its <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> property to help balance the budget back home. Mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is doing it to finance a new ambassador's residence in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> The Argentine Embassy has refused to comment on Japanese press reports that it is looking to sell its ambassador's residence to help pay for the building of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s new capital city. But the diplomatic missions of poorer countries complain of being priced out of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The African nation of <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, for example, closed its embassy in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> last year and its mission in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> now doubles as the embassy for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Embassy land sales have generated waves in diplomatic channels because local authorities are trying to lower prices in hopes of stemming further increases in property prices in the world's most expensive city. `` The Australian government decided it would reduce its current account deficit by selling some of its assets,'' including one-third of its land in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said an embassy spokesman. `` The high value of the yen and booming real estate were factors in the government decision to sell.'' <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s 1.5 acres of prime land with a pond and many trees is in the posh Minato ward and, according to the spokesman, was recently sold to a consortium of four Japanese and two Australian firms. The bid price was $ 475 million or, according to news reports, 2.5 times the asking price for adjacent land. `` It was n't exactly double the standard price, but it was slightly too high,'' said a metropolitan government official, speaking only on condition of anonymity. `` We told them to lower the price, otherwise it would jack up the price of the surrounding area,'' he added. According to Japanese land law, foreign missions are free to sell their property at any cost, the metropolitan government official said. But in light of the recent acceleration in prices, sellers are required to report terms of sales to the government before signing contracts. `` We then advise them if the price is too high,'' the official said, but the city has no power to stop a sale. According to the government-run <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the cost of residential real estate skyrocketed a record 68.9 percent in fiscal 1987, almost double the previous high of 35.9 percent in 1973 and nearly three times the 1986 increase of 23.8 percent. The agency attributed the phenomenal rise to speculative buying prompted by money surpluses and lowered interest rates. While big powers like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> seem settled on their prime embassy grounds, the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> is looking to unload part of its property for a reported $ 111 million. `` We want to sell the land to purchase another property for building our ambassador's residence,'' said an embassy official. The Embassy of <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, which rents the property it occupies, is threatened by a redevelopment plan that would raze the mission buildings to make way for a highrise business complex. `` If our landlord is bought out, we will be too,'' said Ambassador <PERSON> Boniface </PERSON> <PERSON> Zulu </PERSON>. `` We will not stand in the way of progress, though we like it here and want to stay.'' But <PERSON> Shozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, the landlord, is anxious to sell. `` Instead of all these little houses, it would be better to have a highrise,'' he said. `` For us -LRB- landlords -RRB-, renting to diplomats is like volunteer work. If there is some problem with rent payment, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> wo n't touch it, but they also urge us not to evict diplomats for fear of repercussions. `` All we can do is cry ourselves to sleep.'' The Zambian predicament reflects a growing problem among foreign missions in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Some operate with skeleton staffs because of the high cost of living in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Late last year, a group of six ambassadors met with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> and asked the government to `` provide inexpensive land for construction of embassy-related buildings in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>,'' a Foreign Ministry official said. The ministry set up a study group to discuss the proposal, the official said, but it `` has not come up with any concrete ideas.''

<TEXT>
 It was January 1983 and the new <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was at House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>'s door. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, back for a second term as governor four years after he was bounced from office, was chastened, wary and ready to play ball. `` From the first day he came back he was an entirely different person,'' said <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, who had fumed about having to wait outside <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' office during his first term as governor. `` During the four years he was out, he certainly learned how to deal with people. He leaned on us for advice, which was unheard of in the first term.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leaned on nobody for advice in his first term. He appeared arrogant and aloof as he defiantly refused pleas from <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> and other legislative leaders to raise taxes as the state teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, now a liberal Democratic congressman from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> but at the time a state legislator, is quoted in a recent biography of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as saying, `` Everyone in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> except him knew he had to raise taxes.'' Instead, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cut state spending, refused to give state workers a cost-of-living increase at a time of double-digit inflation and slashed thousands from the welfare rolls. <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> activists who had helped elect <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> labeled him a turncoat. Eleven months after taking office he finally gave in and signed the largest tax hike in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> history, an income tax surcharge coupled with an increase in the sales tax. Although he would enjoy some legislative successes in the next three years, he never recovered from the furor caused by the tax hike and program cuts. `` He had alienated probably every group that had been with him,'' said <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>. `` And on top of that he did n't really campaign hard enough.'' So in the Democratic primary in 1978, Democrats rejected <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for renomination, choosing instead a conservative, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. King. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent his years out of office lecturing at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> Returned to office in 1982 and re-elected in 1986, he has changed his ways. He listens to others now and he champions causes that, while complex, are for the most part popular. `` This is not a fellow who has taken a lot of risks in his career,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Linsky </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> legislator who now teaches at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` He represents integrity and competence. He's not a person who tackles highly provocative issues in a challenging way.'' He even has run the risk of being labeled a flip-flopper by changing course on a couple of key issues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the compromiser was most in evidence recently when he announced he would not fight efforts to keep first-degree murderers from getting furloughs from prison. He supports furloughs, but the concept fell into disfavor with legislators after a convicted murderer on furlough fled to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and raped a woman. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he changed his mind as any good manager would when confronted with such strong sentiment. The new <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> started his second term on a roll. The state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was in disarray and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> was in the midst of a stunning economic turnaround anchored by the booming high-tech industry that had settled in the area to draw from the brain banks of nearby universities. Unemployment, which had approached 13 percent in 1975, had plummeted below 4 percent. People started referring to the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Miracle.'' As a presidential candidate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been criticized on the grounds he was taking undeserved credit for the state economy. Studies have attributed most of the boom to high tech, but also have credited <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for not impeding progress and for innovative programs to steer businesses away from the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area and into depressed shoe and textile mill cities. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> makes frequent references these days to perhaps his three greatest achievements as governor: legislation guaranteeing health care to all workers; a jobs training program for welfare recipients that state officials say has resulted in 45,000 job placements and reduced the state welfare caseload; and a vigorous tax enforcement program credited with turning the $ 300 million deficit that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> inherited from King into a $ 500 million surplus. The welfare program, Employment Training, and the tax enforcement package were enacted during <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' second term. He also won passage of a condominium conversion bill protecting tenants, a law requiring employers to notify workers about the use of toxic materials and a plant-closing law he now trumpets on the campaign trail. It encourages tottering businesses to notify the state before shutting down and provides job-training programs for workers in danger of losing their jobs. Instructive of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' new style was the way he handled the tax collection package known as REAP _ Revenue Enhancement and Protection. Publishing the names of tax scofflaws in newspapers and shutting down businesses that owed taxes were not overwhelmingly popular ideas. In his first term, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> likely would have dropped the package on the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> with a take-it-or-leave-it attitude. Instead, he called together an array of lawmakers and interest groups. `` He told them they would have to fight for smaller slices or give him the resources he needed,'' recalls <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a former state tax commissioner. `` He listened, they listened and we got it all.'' The legislature during his second term did reject some <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ideas _ a new business tax to fund infrastructure programs, a gay rights bill and a proposal to finance the state pension fund liability which has kept <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> from getting a top bond rating. As <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prospered, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his state began to get national attention, there were growing signs the governor had an eye on the national political landscape.

 In 1984, he was considered a possible running mate for <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and was given several roles within the national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, traveling to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and elsewhere promoting his jobs-for-welfare recipients program and his tax collection ideas. His peers designated him the nation's most effective governor. His willingness to make deals and a good sense of timing were serving him well. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who had vetoed a 1984 tax cut, signed several tax reductions in the next three years, even a repeal of the tax surcharge that remained in place from his first term. He won a third term in 1986 with nearly 70 percent of the vote. Now he boasts that he has experience `` mopping up Republican red ink'' while cutting taxes. The assertion draws mixed reviews back home. `` I saw his ads in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> when I was home visiting,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, executive director of an anti-tax lobby called Citizens for Limited Taxation. `` Those people out there do n't know that he was dragged kicking and screaming into those tax cuts. The reputation is a fabricated myth.'' <PERSON> Linsky </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> political consultant <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> disagree. `` He did sign those tax cuts and he can say that,'' said <PERSON> Linsky </PERSON>. `` He does n't say he proposed them.'' `` Anything is fair play in the political arena,'' said <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>. `` Politicians get more blame than they deserve for some things and they also tend to get more credit than they deserve for others.'' Still, some projections say spending will have to be rolled back or the state could face a $ 200 million deficit by the end of the current fiscal year. `` I think many people who are familiar with financial management are laughing when people say our state is in great fiscal shape,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>, executive director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> blame <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the new budget crunch, saying he should have put money aside instead of increasing state spending by nearly $ 1 billion a year since returning to office. Yet they also mounted much of the pressure that led to the tax cuts. `` Anyone can manage on a billion-dollar-a-year increase,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` Wait until the miracle worker is facing the national deficit. He'll do what he's done before, cut services and raise taxes.'' But that first term was a long time ago. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is a different state and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a different politician. Despite facing token Republican opposition in 1986, he campaigned hard, mindful of 1978 and perhaps with an eye on national exposure, beginning with his neighbors to the north, hosts of the all-important <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> presidential primary. He had said little during his first term while construction was under way at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant just over the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> border. But he became a loud critic in recent years. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> now refuses to submit federally required evacuation plans for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> towns near <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, blocking the plant from opening. Polls show a majority of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> residents oppose <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> later began to criticize the troubled Pilgrim nuclear power plant in his own state. The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> considers it one of the nation's worst. The plant has been closed on the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s orders for two years and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has demanded that state officials be permitted to question managers about safety issues before the plant can be reopened. Shortly after being elected to his current term, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> introduced the health care measure, a first-in-the nation proposal that guarantees health insurance to virtually all workers by 1992. He was so eager to get the idea enacted into law that his original bill was derided by both parties as poorly conceived and had to be completely reworked. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> touts the plan as a national model, but critics say it will not work in states without a strong economy. The governor generally is considered a good manager, but several incidents involving subordinates have stirred doubts. He was shaken early in his presidential campaign when it came out that his top aide, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, had leaked to reporters a videotape showing that one of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' rival in the presidential campaign, Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, had used the words and sentiments of a British politician as though they were his own. The disclosure forced <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> out of the presidential race. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who had said he disliked negative campaigning, said his campaign had not been responsible for the leak. Later <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> owned up to his role _ showing that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been kept in the dark by his closest adviser on an explosive issue. At first, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would not fire <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>; then he reluctantly accepted his resignation. In another incident, a longtime <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign organizer appointed president at <ORGANIZATION> Bridgewater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty this month to diverting $ 80,000 in federal money for personal use while he was in charge of the state's adult education program. And in 1986 it was disclosed that high state officials authorized a $ 10,000 payment to a student who had accused the president of <ORGANIZATION> Westfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> of sexually assaulting him. <PERSON> Linsky </PERSON> believes voters consider <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> personally above reproach in these incidents because of his role as a reformist legislator in the 1960s and the `` Mr. Clean'' public image he has created by his family man approach to his work. `` In that sense he's like -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, not in the ` Teflon' sense but in the sense that he himself has a great deal of integrity and that he is very comfortable with himself, not a person who goes around conveying a lot of self-doubt,'' said <PERSON> Linksy </PERSON>.

<HEAD>The Return of Big Steel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After years of problems with old facilities and foreign competition, and threatened and actual bankruptcies, the steel industry is reclaiming its status in the American industrial scene. Its return could n't have been more effectively stated than on April 26, when <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 1 steelmaker, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> and National reported solid earnings improvements. Just a year ago it was another story: <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> was in the red, <LOCATION> Bethelehem </LOCATION> was the subject of bankruptcy rumors, Wheeling had filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws, and National was losing money. Still, 1987 was n't so bad. For the industry as a whole it was the first profitable year since 1981. Yes, six straight years in the red for what used to be considered the symbol of American industrial might. Now, 1988 is shaping up as an even better year than 1987. Reflecting this, steel stocks are in favor again and rising. Moreover, steel analysts are saying that the new steel industry probably will be profitable for a long time to come, a consequence not just of the lower dollar but of a long and costly rejuvenation over the past decade or so. Says <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, analyst for Value Line: `` The investment case for steel is the strongest it's been in years, both for the performance-minded and for those with a three - to five-year perspective. Among other things, the industry has rid itself of dated facilities; shrunk itself by one-third; installed continuous casting systems that reduce labor, materials and energy costs; and retreated from ill-conceived diversifications. Its seemingly ages-old complaint about high labor costs _ workers in the steel industry commonly received much higher wages than in comparable industries _ seems to have been resolved. Unions have made wage concessions. The turnabout was a painful one, marked by years of outraged charges of unfair foreign competition, demands for government protection, confrontations with environmentalists, troubles with labor and, some say, poor management. Old-time steel management was composed of dedicated individuals who did n't like outsiders, including the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, telling them what they must do. While committed to their industry, they might also have been committed to old-fashioned techniques. Whatever, they were no match for the newcomers. Foreign steel made in new plants by new techniques _ some developed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but not widely employed here _ flooded the country. Lower foreign wages helped; so did the dollar's relatively high value in foreign trade. At times, it looked hopeless. A theory developed that the steel industry for years to come would wander the world, with newly industrialized nations snatching business from older producers with old equipment and rising wages. It was a terrible thought for Americans to contemplate a steel industry they had considered invulnerable. When the same problems began arising in automotive and other industries, the brooding intensified. It was a long road back for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers, who seemed reluctant to believe they should n't remain No. 1 even if their products were n't. It was hard to swallow pride, but necessary to do so before the recovery could begin. Now that steel producers seem competitive again, the marketplace might give them a further thrust, says <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>. Underlying his optimism, he says, is not just the lower dollar but the need for refurbishing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> infrastructure. Reminders of this need come every day in reports of bridges requiring repairs or replacement. Few bridges are built anywhere these days without a lot of steel in them. End Adv PMs Friday April 29

<HEAD>$12,000 for Prep School? Is It Worth It???

 Convincing parents that top prep schools are `` worth'' tuitions exceeding $ 10,000 is n't always easy. But even harder are the challenges of ensuring classrooms are filled in future years with ethnically diverse students and faculty.

 Perhaps the least of the challenges facing the private school that proclaims itself `` the pearl of the Midwest'' is explaining to parents why it's worth $ 12,000 annual tuition. The 300-acre campus of <ORGANIZATION> Cranbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingswood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> has the requisite prep-school luxuries: a hockey arena, bowling alleys, indoor and outdoor tennis courts where players' strokes are videotaped, and an old-time swimming hole called <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonah </PERSON>, so named because it's shaped like a whale For its 800 students, each day is an aesthetic feast _ from the tapestries and art deco light fixtures down to the very doorknobs and lunchroom chairs. These, and practically everything else, were designed or influenced by famed Finnish architect <PERSON> Eliel </PERSON> <PERSON> Saarinen </PERSON>, who lived and taught here from 1925 to his death in 1950. But just as the virtues of top private schools like this are n't just skin-deep, neither are the problems With the school-age population declining and prep school tuitions sometimes rivaling <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> colleges, officials worry about future enrollments and are casting their recruiting nets from coast to coast. The nation's approximately 1,700 independent private schools, those not receiving tax or church funds, enroll some 600,000 students, up 9.7 percent over the last decade. But the number of students taking private school admissions tests dropped by 14 percent in the last two years, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>. A few years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Cranbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingswood </ORGANIZATION> could almost fill its classes with students just from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and surrounding <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> states. Now the school recruits from as far away as southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` If we did n't do that kind of thing we would n't be in good shape in five years because of the demographics. The best schools are out there all the time,'' said admissions director <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kridler </PERSON>, whose travel budget has risen from $ 500 to $ 15,000 in recent years, and who now makes routine visits to 35 cities in 17 states. Like other prep schools, <PERSON> Cranbrook </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingswood </PERSON> has constantly fought a perception of elitism. The formerly all-white, predominantly <PERSON> Episcopalian </PERSON> school is now 25 percent Jewish and 25 percent `` persons of color'' including Indians, Asian-Americans and blacks, a change due largely to aggressive minority student recruiting and a $ 15.8 million endowment that helps make sizable scholarships possible. <PERSON> Cranbrook </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingswood </PERSON> is the most expensive boarding school in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, and among the most expensive in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. But it is a bargain compared with the priciest Eastern schools. <ORGANIZATION> Leland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, is the nation's most expensive private college preparatory school, charging $ 18,500 for a year's tuition, fees, room and board. <ORGANIZATION> Cranbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingswood </ORGANIZATION>, at $ 12,000, ranks 44th in the nation. Another stubborn problem is finding minority teachers. Of 90 upper-school faculty members, four are black, one is Hispanic, one is Asian-American. But such challenges seem remote at 8 a.m. as English teacher <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayroian </PERSON> poured the coffee in his carpeted classroom for a dozen students, about half the size of most public school classes. He kicked off a discussion on the religious and moral implications of <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON>'s classic `` Siddhartha'': `` Should we prepare to come to the presence of the holy on a motorcycle?'' he asked. `` What should be the relationship between technology and the holy?'' In <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>'s biology lab, nine juniors toil on a typically complex question: At what wavelengths does chlorophyll in plants absorb the most light? `` They use a college text,'' <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. `` And I do n't give them a whole lot of answers.'' `` Academically I've never seen anything like it,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> from nearby <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, whose daughter <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> is an 11th-grade day student. `` Public school kids might come home at 2:30 or 3 in the afternoon, but my daughter typically is n't home until 6 or 7 at night, and then she buries herself in the books.'' It's a school rule that the 270 boarding students must be in their rooms studying every evening Sunday through Thursday. Upon graduation, each student's name is hand-carved into the oak walls of Alumni Court. Those names include such luminaries as <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Senator <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsberg </PERSON>, who leaked the Pentagon Papers; poet <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leithauser </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> editor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinsley </PERSON>. Nonetheless, schools that tout themselves as training grounds for future leaders in an increasingly diverse world simply ca n't ignore the issues of race and ethnicity any longer, said school president and acting director <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON> Yet private schools remain overwhelmingly white, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NAIS </ORGANIZATION>'s own statistics. In 1986-87, independent school enrollments were 4.7 percent black, 1.8 percent Hispanic, 4.7 percent Asian-American and 0.1 percent Native American. `` I recruit in <LOCATION> Cabrini </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kridler </PERSON>, referring to an all-black <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> housing project, `` and I go to Mexican-American neighborhoods. `` Inner city kids think we're not affordable. I talk a lot about financial aid opportunities,'' <PERSON> Kridler </PERSON> said. About 24 percent of students in the upper school, grades 9-12, get financial aid, covering two-thirds of need on average. Still, 22 students accepted last year did not enroll for money reasons. Low teacher salaries remain a source of frustration, especially for younger faculty, even though median salaries have risen $ 7,000 in five years. Nationally, beginning private school teachers make $ 12,000-19 ,000 and average salaries for all such teachers was $ 23,000, about $ 5,000 less than public school teachers Fayroian, a 25-year-old first-year teacher, earns $ 16,300. He says he is up at 4 a.m. and in bed at midnight, spending his day and evening grading papers, teaching classes and meeting with students. The salary `` can be disheartening for the amount of work we do,'' he said. Top scale at <LOCATION> Cranbrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingswood </LOCATION> is $ 34,000, and the median is $ 25,600. There's no teacher union and no tenure. On the other hand, private school teachers generally have more freedom to choose textbooks and shape their lessons free of bureaucratic interference. At <LOCATION> Cranbrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingswood </LOCATION>, the resulting curriculum is so rigorous many students find college easy by comparison. The school recently studied its recent graduates and found their freshman grades often improved compared with their grades at <LOCATION> Cranbrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingswood </LOCATION>. Students who averaged 2.0 to 2.5 at the prep school averaged 2.86 as college freshmen, for example. What makes the grind worth it is the extraordinarily high probability of admission to one of the better <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleges. Of 190 graduates in 1987, 187 went to college, 14 as national merit finalists. Their Scholastic Aptitude Test scores averaged 1100 of a possible 1600, compared with a national average of 906. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Botvinick </PERSON>, a 17-year-old senior from <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, whose public schools lead the state, nonetheless chose to come here and was recently granted early acceptance at his dream school, <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Brainard </PERSON>, a 12th grader from <LOCATION> Crosslands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, says there's no comparison between what she gets here and what she would have gotten at her hometown school `` Private schools are very stereotyped,'' she said. `` People think they're very snobby. But we're not; we come here for the education. I do n't know what my chances would have been at <ORGANIZATION> Nitro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Crosslands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> award-winner <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> has done something very few <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> actors would even think of trying: He's relearned his lines in Japanese to bring a Broadway hit to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. His performance as <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, the slave friend of <PERSON> Huckleberry </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, delights Japanese audiences and has made him and the musical `` Big River'' a big success. `` When I walk out onto the stage and deliver my first line I hear a loud, swift intake of breath,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. `` The audience is surprised to see a black man walk out onto the stage and speak in Japanese.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who originated the role in the play which won the Tony for best musical in 1985, said audiences are also surprised by his booming voice, and, though generally more quiet and reserved than Americans, react with a lot of noise themselves when the show is over. `` They like me!'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> laughed. `` We've been getting an incredible reaction. I think the Japanese forget that they are in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' Before coming to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a 36-year-old native of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said he really did n't know what to expect. `` I came here with an open mind, wide open for experiences,'' he said in an interview. `` I was prepared to make adjustments.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> began studying Japanese last August, six hours a week at the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In November, he came to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on a promotion tour and got a chance to try out his new-found skills. Before coming back in February, he secluded himself on the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> shore for 2 -LCB- months. `` It took me a very, very long time to learn my lines,'' he said. `` I'm amazed I was able to do this. Up until the very end I really was n't sure.'' The only part of the show he did n't need to relearn was the songs. `` I had to sing in English or else I would n't be able to make it. The songs in English give me time to regroup,'' he said. Three other Americans are in the 29-member cast, but <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> is the only one required to make long speeches in Japanese. Success has n't left much time to get out and see the country, but has given him a feel for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s workaholic pace. `` With eight or nine shows a week, I only see <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from my window.'' Being way off Broadway is a pleasure, though. `` American musicals are a new form for the Japanese cast, and they're dedicated,'' he said `` Theater people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can be complacent. But every night here is exciting.'' After his first performance, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was visited backstage by Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>, who he said were warm and generous with praise. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s parents were also in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for opening night. `` I come from a talented family, and not much shakes them. But this did,'' he said. `` They saw me in a whole new light. That was nice.''

<TEXT>
 From broken hearts to broken bones, more than 2 million children were abused and neglected across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. Three died every day. Even more alarming, reports of child abuse have increased by 223 percent over 10 years, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit, Chicago-based organization with 67 chapters. The case numbers rose from 669,000 in 1976 to 2,160,000 in 1986, although some experts say some part of the increase is due to heightened public awareness and state laws that make reporting mandatory. Tragically, too many abuse cases slip past the social agencies meant to protect such children. Two recent cases in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> underscore the agencies' limitations: In one, a toddler who had already survived two fractured skulls was returned to her parents because an agency had not told the hearing judge that assault charges were pending against them; in the other, despite the best efforts of social workers, an alcoholic mother allowed her twin daughters to starve to death Child abuse ranges from a lack of affection to death. Based on incomplete surveys and projections, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 1,132 children died of abuse last year. But <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moelis </PERSON>, a research analyst for the committee, said the number could be as high as 5,000. `` Many deaths are often attributed to other causes such as sudden infant death syndrome but are suspected to have been caused by child abuse,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Moelis </PERSON>. According to recent committee findings, at least 25 percent of the fatal cases had previously been referred to authorities but fell through the cracks because there was n't enough coordination among between agencies. Ms. <PERSON> Moelis </PERSON> said authorities are so overwhelmed by their workload that `` it's very difficult to assess which families are most at risk of seriously harming their child.'' In about half the cases, abuse takes the form of physical neglect, according to a 1984 report from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protecting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Children are not properly fed, clothed or given medical care. An additional 25 percent are physically abused, 14 percent are sexually assaulted and 10 percent suffer emotional abuse such as unreasonable parental demands or lack of caring. In 85 percent of the cases, the abusers are the parents. Many states are trying to deal more effectively with child abuse. Thirty-two states have review committees to examine child abuse deaths. Fifteen states are trying to find better ways to flag the greatest risk cases. Six states have passed or proposed legislation to toughen sentences for abusers who kill children. According to Parents Anonymous, a self-help group aimed at heading off abuse before it occurs, most abusive parents are under stress, unable to meet their own needs or bothered by something from their own childhoods. <PERSON> Judi </PERSON> <PERSON> Czimbal </PERSON>, director of program development for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Parents Anonymous, said the main problems are isolation, feelings of being overwhelmed, financial problems and fatigue. `` They want to be good parents, but they often do n't know how,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Czimbal </PERSON>. `` They wind up getting very angry, and they'll take their frustrations out on a child without wanting to.

 The 18-month-old twins had been dead at least 14 hours when they were found in their sheetless crib Dec. 20, 1983. One weighed 14 pounds, the other 11, less than half the normal weight of babies their age. They had starved to death in the middle of the largest city in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. In the middle of a housing project. Before the eyes of their mother. <PERSON> Valarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 33, was sentenced Oct. 8, 1987, to six to nine years in state prison after pleading guilty to two counts of manslaughter by negligence, but the judge cut the sentence to one year in prison and five years' probation. Detective Capt. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelzer </PERSON> said the case was the most extreme case of negligence he had seen in 24 years on the force. Medical Examiner <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mednick </PERSON> testified at the inquest that the children had no fat around their organs and were so dehydrated they lacked even eye fluid. The case took <ORGANIZATION> Hampden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> Attorney <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> more than three years to resolve because of constant procedural delays, and the inquest results, from 1984, were made public only recently. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> refused to be interviewed, but now that she is in prison, neighbors are talking and court records and interviews help paint the painful picture of how it happened. Latashia and <PERSON> Latoya </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> were born June 6, 1982, a month early. Although underdeveloped, they appeared healthy to state social workers and checked out fine with doctors up through their last visit in August 1983. Their mother, however, seemed depressed. `` I had the feeling that she was perhaps overwhelmed by the care of two children,'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Buell </PERSON>, a nurse with the Early Childhood Service Team who visited the family until the twins were 6 months old, testified at the inquest. A small, solitary woman, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> lived with the twins in a two-bedroom apartment in a project tucked into a residential neighborhood of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Buell </PERSON> said the apartment was always neat when she visited, but was devoid of toys or other signs of children. `` You'd never think the children were living with her,'' she said in a recent interview. She also said the mother resisted help. `` I know everybody made efforts to keep her in counseling and they were n't too successful,'' <PERSON> Buell </PERSON> said. `` Oh, sure, she'd show up, but she'd just sit there and look away from you.'' Neighbors said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> socialized in the summertime, often bringing the babies to barbeques held nightly in the yards of the dozen red, white and blue four-family apartment houses. She drank, the neighbors said. She also visited other apartments for what appeared to be an afternoon drinking ritual, they said. The twins were left behind on those occasions. `` Some of the time she came back she was high or just staggering,'' a downstairs neighbor, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, testified at the inquest. The twins' father, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, visitedeach Thursday. A married man who'd met <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> at a bar where they worked, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> lived with his family on the other side of town but testified that he sneaked away regularly to see his out-of-wedlock daughters, bringing them diapers and cookies `` when I have an extra couple of dollars.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> testified that they were fed `` adult food, like mashed potatoes,'' and that when he mentioned their thinness to their mother, she told him they had a cold and were n't eating properly. A week before the twins died, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who lived across the street, sais she saw them lying in their crib, `` a bottle in each hand and nothing in the bottle.'' Despite the clues, however, `` it did n't dawn on me she was n't taking care of them,'' she said in an interview She added that she was afraid to report <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a fear experts say is common to friends and relatives of alcoholics. `` If you see somebody coughing to death, you say, ` How about getting to a doctor?' But alcoholism is another thing,'' said <PERSON> Collette </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a counselor at Alcoholism Services of <LOCATION> Greater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. `` People feel they are infringing on the alcoholic's right to privacy. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s boyfriend, <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON>, testified that he and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> spent the evening of Dec. 19 and the early hours of Dec. 20, 1983, at her apartment, drinking vodka and beer. She later told police the children `` fussed all night. They cried, but that is not unusual, they do that sometime. I checked on them and they were OK.'' The police say she added: `` I do n't remember if I fed the kids today or not It might have been yesterday. I think I gave them some water today.'' Late that day, after she had slept some hours, she visited <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, drank two beers and a half-pint of vodka, left and 20 minutes later called Green from a pay phone, according to police reports and interviews. Sobbing, and with loud music playing in the background, `` she said, ` I need a drink bad.' She said she was having a lot of problems, but she would n't say what,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. Not long afterwards, in the early evening, a few neighbors were in a downstairs apartment when <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> ran to them crying, `` No! No! My babies is dead, both of them.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, the neighbor, ran upstairs and found the children on their sides, `` staring at one another,'' he later testified. They were pronounced dead at the local hospital. On Jan. 25, 1985, more than two years after her babies withered away in their crib, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter by negligence and two counts of failing to supply adequate care and guidance. When it came time for sentencing, Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheibel </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Hampden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keady </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to imprison <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> for an unspecified period, saying: `` Motherhood carries great responsibility and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> did not live up to that responsibility. Here alcoholism should not excuse what she did or did n't do.'' `` I can not disagree,'' <PERSON> Keady </PERSON> replied. `` I do n't think we can forget about these two children. Even back to pregnancy, these children were at her mercy.'' After the inquest, free on personal recognizance, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> lived for a time with her mother. She had another child, despite birth control counseling. The boy, who recently turned 2, also failed to thrive under her care. He was placed temporarily in a foster home and then put in the custody of his grandmother, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, joining <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s 11-year-old daughter, who has lived with Young since infancy `` She was an alcoholic, that was her problem,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said about her daughter. `` She was never a bad girl. I never had any problem with her.'' The nurse who tried to help <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said alcohol counseling simply failed. `` This was a case that more or less seemed to defeat the system,'' <PERSON> Buell </PERSON> said. `` She could n't be helped.''

 <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> is noted for saying many things, such as telling farmers decades ago to get bigger or get out. Or advising them during the boom export years to plant fence-row to fence-row. Another: God put the worm in the apple, man took it out. That was one of <PERSON> Butz </PERSON>'s prime quips when he was secretary of agriculture in the early 1970s during the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administrations. He used it often when environmentalists complained about using too many chemicals on farm crops. <PERSON> Butz </PERSON>, who will be 79 on July 3, is still a favorite on the agricultural speaking circuit. And he occasionally touches raw nerves with his candor. Last fall, <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> was a guest commentator in the respected quarterly magazine, Choices, which is published by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. As an economist and dean emeritus of agriculture at <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> is right at home among his professional colleagues. <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> wrote about one of his favorite topics, risk, and how Americans live in a risk-filled world. Always have, he said, from westward-bound prairie schooners to the `` heaven-bound rocket Challenger of our day.'' In those adventures, he said, some Americans lost their lives. Yet all were driven to risk by `` the dream of something better than what they already had'' or by the dream of greater reward if the risk paid off. <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> said that a growing world population means that agriculture must push even harder to produce more on a shrinking resource base. In doing so, he said, `` Caution must be exercised that we do n't go overboard in our hysteria to clean up the environment and make everything absolutely safe.'' It means using more chemicals, not less, <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> said. It means a vertical expansion `` into the realm of science'' in order to feed the world. There should be more biotechnology, more antibiotics, more pesticides _ more risk-taking, not less, he said. `` Modern agricuture can not continue to produce adequate amounts of safe and wholesome food without substantial use of chemicals and antibiotics,'' he said. As <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> sees it, one of the problems is that two-thirds of living Americans never had the experience of biting into a wormy apple and, after seeing the worm hole, wonder whether they had eaten the worm or whether it was still in the apple. `` Let's be honest about it,'' <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> said. `` God put the worm in the apple; man took it out ... Man used poison to get it out _ deadly poison. But the good part is that you ca n't buy a bad apple in your town today.'' <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> said it is `` completely unacceptable to believe that there is no way out of the problems we have created'' through chemicals and other scientific means. `` Unquestionably, there are risks involved, but none so great as the risk that we may quit risking, try vainly to set the clock back, and abjectly surrender the goal of a better world is the mistaken belief that this one is as good as can be,'' he said. Well! In the spring issue of the magazine, <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> was mauled by a couple of letter-writing colleagues for some of his assertions. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloome </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> is correct about the futility of seeking a risk-free existence but adds that `` we should not become cavalier'' about the risks inherent in progress. `` I can deal with the worm in my apple,'' <PERSON> Bloome </PERSON> wrote. `` What I can not deal with in my apple _ or my drinking water _ is the poison that killed the worm. I expect science to remove the worm from my apple that involves an acceptable risk at an acceptable cost.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> said, `` <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> made me feel un-American. Perhaps I should start smoking and riding a motorcycle without a helmet.'' The goal of agricultural ecologists, he said, `` is not to turn the clock back, but to design agricultural systems which are sustainable, stable, and resilient, as well as productive.'' Biological, or natural, controls are preferable to contamination by chemicals. <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> had the last word in a postscript, contending that the comments `` largely reinforce the main thesis'' of what he had written. `` Of course, we should pursue biological -LRB- natural -RRB- controls,'' he said. `` But let us not become so zealous in pursuit of that goal that we discourage research in chemical controls ... we need both.''

 Scientists have found superconductivity at relatively high temperatures in a material that lacks copper, suggesting new routes toward making superconducting compounds practical. The find broadens the range of potential ingredients for superconductors, and its atomic structure suggests it may be easier to make into wires and other useful products than previously known materials, scientists said. Superconductivity is the ability of some materials to conduct electricity without loss to resistance. Improved superconductors could lead the way to powerful and compact computers, high-speed floating trains and other advances, scientists say.

 Healthy gains in Americans' personal incomes and consumer spending last month indicate consumers have rebounded from last October's stock market crash, economists say. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that personal incomes climbed 0.8 percent in March after a 0.6 percent gain in February. It was the biggest increase since an identical 0.8 percent advance in December. Consumer spending jumped 0.7 percent in March, the government reported. Analysts said spending and income figures indicated the consumer, who cut back on purchases immediately following the October stock market crash, had rebounded and was continuing to propel overall economic growth. `` There is no serious consumer retrenchment going on. People are still willing to buy,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic forecasting firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We should n't face any serious problem of a spending slump for the rest of the year.'' But the latest economic report had little impact in the financial markets, where stock prices edged up, bond prices slipped and the dollar edged lower. Oil prices ended lower after trading erratically on speculation over the outcome of a meeting between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and independent oil producers. The non-OPEC nations have proposed that both groups cut exports in order to help boost world oil prices. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the June delivery contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> crude fell 33 cents a barrel to $ 18.27. The 0.8 percent March increase in incomes would have been a only 0.2 percent if special factors including an annual bonus for auto workers had been excluded. The average $ 2,500 payment to 108,000 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees accounted for more than half of the increase in wages and salaries last month, which rose 0.5 percent in March, the government said. In all, personal incomes rose $ 29.6 billion to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of $ 3.92 trillion. Personal consumption spending, which includes virtually everything except interest payments on debt, rose $ 21.8 billion to an annual rate of $ 3.09 billion. Disposable, or after-tax, incomes were up as well, climbing 0.6 percent in March following a 0.8 percent February increase. Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable income, dipped slightly last month to 4.5 percent from 4.7 percent in February, although both months showed an improvement from the 3.7 percent average savings rate in 1987. Spending rose in the categories of non-durable goods and services. Durable goods, items such as cars that are expected to last at least three years, edged down $ 300 million during March after a huge $ 9.2 billion rise in February. But purchases of non-durable goods rose $ 9.8 billion while purchases of services, which include housing costs, rose $ 12.2 billion. In other events, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 8.53 billion in two-year notes at the highest yields in nearly four months. The average yield was 7.64 percent, up from 7.39 percent at the last auction on March 31 and the highest since two-year notes averaged 7.93 percent on Dec. 31.

 Oil prices seesawed and then slumped in a wild trading session driven by speculation about the outcome of a meeting between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and independent oil exporters. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the June contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> crude jumped 12 cents per barrel to $ 18.72 by noon Wednesday but tumbled late in the day and closed at $ 18.27, down 33 cents from the previous close. Similar swings affected refined products traded on the exchange. The near-month contracts for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell .06 cent a gallon to 52.36 cents, and wholesale heating oil fell .27 cent a gallon to 51.77 cents. Traders said the market strengthened in early activity because of indications that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> and a group of non-cartel oil exporters, meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, might agree on 5 percent production cuts aimed at eliminating excess supplies and raising prices. But later rumors hit the market that key <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had walked out of the meeting. By another unconfirmed account, the non-OPEC participants at the meeting had inflated their production figures so the 5 percent output reduction proposal would be largely meaningless. Some traders who had bought oil on the hunch that prices would rise because of the meeting became nervous and sold, accelerating the late-afternoon slide. Others said the market closed in a position to rally sharply if the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC bargainers can devise a production-cutting pact. Some said prices easily could surge toward $ 19 a barrel.

<HEAD>Chrysler Delays Kenosha Closing, Transfer of K-car to Mexico</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 By backtracking from earlier proposals to close an assembly plant and move some auto production to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has revived hopes of a quick end to early contract talks, union negotiators say. The automaker announced Wednesday it would delay for several months the planned closing of its <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> assembly plant and the transfer of K-car assembly work to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Union displeasure over the K-car plan, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s initial contract proposals and other developments had helped sour and bog down the talks, which were begun earlier than usual to help ease growing friction between the company and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. Following Wednesday's announcements, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said union bargainers were ready to negotiate into the night and through the weekend to make up for lost time. `` I hope <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> would stick around and watch this management in terms of how they perform so at least we can sit down and negotiate a contract within the next seven to 10 days peacefully without some other stupid announcement that this company is now becoming very famous for,'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. Many union members were angered last week when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> confirmed reports that it planned to shift K-car production from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in July. The <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> closing has been a sore point since <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced in January that it would close the 5,500-worker plant in September, despite earlier indications to workers and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> officials that it would be kept open another five years. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> attributed the decisions to delay the moves to better-than-expected sales of K-cars and of cars built at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>. The union also had been miffed by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s contract proposals, which veered sharply from a job-protecting industry-pattern contract established last fall at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, as the union was considering breaking off negotiations, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and later with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> managers and negotiators in an effort to get the talks back on track `` I think we've got to cut out the rhetoric and get down to work'' on contract negotiations, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said Wednesday. Talks on the contract, which expires Sept. 14 and covers 66,000 active workers in 15 states, opened April 18, four months early. Both sides hoped an early settlement could mend hostility over the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> closing and over <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s aborted attempt to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary earlier this year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> had planned to close the former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> in September. Phase-out was scheduled to begin in July, when production of the Omni-Horizon was to be moved from <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s Jefferson Avenue assembly plant. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also planned to end <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> K-car production when the Omni-Horizon was moved to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, assembly plant was converted from K-car production to building the K-car's replacement A plant in <LOCATION> Toluca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was to fill orders for 1989-model Dodge Aries and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reliant </ORGANIZATION> K-cars. Instead, <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> will build the Omni-Horizon and other cars in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> until December, giving workers up to a six-month respite. The K-car will stay in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> until the Omni-Horizon is moved there in January. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> left open the possibility of boosting K-car imports from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in beginning in January. But <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said adoption of the industry pattern contract at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> before then would make it easier for the union to combat such a move.

 Agricultural experts have said the government's goal of producing 450 million tons of grain annually by 1990 will be impossible to attain, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday Speakers at a meeting this week organized by the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said it would be at least 1992 before the nation's farmers reach the 450-million ton target Increasing grain output has been made a top priority of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government following three straight years of disappointing harvests. In 1987 the nation produced 402 million tons, up from 391 million in 1986 but still below the record 407 million tons in 1984. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must increase output to 500 million tons by the year 2000 merely to keep up with population growth. Grain production has stagnated in recent years as farmers, unhappy with low government-set prices for grains, turned to more lucrative cash crops such as vegetables, while some landholders gave up farming and used their land to erect small factories. The government has tried to encourage farmers to grow grain by boosting prices and giving priority to grain farmers in allotments of fertilizer and fuel. Experts at the conference also recommended that efforts be made to increase yields and open up about 3 million hectares, roughly 7.5 million acres, of virgin land by the year 2000. They said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will try to sow about 13 million hectares of high-yield hybrid rice by the turn of the century.

<HEAD>Bank Of Korea Reports Record Current Account Surplus In March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Boosted by strong exports, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s current account surplus grew to a record $ 1.18 billion in March, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> said today. The latest figure shows a substantial increase from February's surplus of $ 970 million and the $ 884 million surplus of March 1987 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s previous monthly record surplus was $ 1.12 billion for last September. The current account largely measures a nation's trade in merchandise and services. The central bank said the surplus in the January-March quarter widened to $ 2.95 billion from $ 2.12 billion in the same period last year. But bank officials predicted that the surplus would decline in coming months because of further import liberalization moves by the government.

Industry analysts had said <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>'s initial bid for <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s 30.4 million common shares outstanding plus its preferred stock was well below the company's fair market price, which some estimated could be up to $ 40 a share. The new offer `` indicates the seriousness by <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> to make a deal with <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The $ 32 bid was unrealistic.

 Now that rival oil producers have offered <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> the help it sought for years, the cartel seems unsure how to use it. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and four smaller independent oil producers offered to cut their exports by 5 percent if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries makes a proportionally similar sacrifice. All the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members say they're pleased the offer was made, but few said whether they like the idea. Oil ministers from all 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member countries arranged a meeting tonight to decide what to do about the proposal. Some analysts say the plan, if accepted by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and implemented by all 19 countries involved, probably would push oil prices up to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s target of $ 18 a barrel. Most OPEC crudes are selling in the open market for $ 16 a barrel or less. The oil market in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was unsettled and slightly weaker today in early trading, London-based traders said. The price of Brent crude from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> was down 25 cents, at $ 17.25 a barrel, roughly matching declines in late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading on Wednesday. Analysts said the market appeared to be viewing the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> talks as only a prelude to more crucial negotiations in June, when the cartel may face tough decisions about cutting production by larger amounts to avert a price slide. `` For now they're just firefighting,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a London-based oil consultant. Prices fell Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The June contract West Texas Intermediate, the most widely traded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, fell 33 cents to $ 18.27 a barrel. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlotok </PERSON>, who monitored the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> talks for the New York-based investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the nations were on target for a possible agreement to boost prices. But <PERSON> Mlotok </PERSON> acknowledged that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> rarely makes decisions about reducing its oil production or its exports without long, often unproductive negotiations. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, a leading advocate of production cuts to help boost prices, said on Wednesday that it supported the independent producers' proposal. When a reporter asked Libyan Oil Minister <PERSON> Fawzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakshuki </PERSON> if his government could accept the plan, he replied: `` It depends.'' He did n't elaborate. <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> president and oil minister of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, sought to evade reporters' questions about his country's position on the export-cutting plan. He stressed that this was the first time a group of non-OPEC oil producers offered to restrain production as a gesture of cooperation with the cartel. `` It's a good proposal in that it's a proposal that we've never had before,'' he said. The position of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the cartel's largest producer and the world's biggest oil exporter, was equally unclear. At one point Saudi Oil Minister <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> told reporters, `` We'd like greater participation'' in oil export cuts by independent producers. He declined to say if his government favored the proposal before <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. At another point, when asked if he thought <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would accept the offer, he replied: `` We have n't done anything yet.'' Six <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers met with representatives of the non-OPEC countries on Wednesday to review the export-cutting plan. The independent producers envison reductions of 200,000 barrels daily in their exports and about 700,000 barrels a day in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s exports. After their meeting the two groups said they shared a desire to see stability in oil prices and found `` much common ground in their analysis'' of the world oil market situation. They stopped short of saying they agreed on how price stability could be achieved, but sought to stress the importance of the meeting between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and rival producers. `` It constitutes the beginning of a new stage of cooperation between a large number of oil-producing countries,'' the groups stated. The six non-OPEC countries involved are <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> took part in the talks but said it would not join in the proposed export cuts.

 Authorities today said nearly 3,000 people had died in the 1984 <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> disaster and estimated that more than 1,700 more will die over the next seven years as a result of the gas leak. The figures were contained in a new relief plan that will provide $ 285 million in economic and medical aid to victims of toxic methyl-isocyanate gas released by a plant owned by a <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. The plan, released by the government of central Madhya Pradesh state, said 2,998 people had died in the world's worst industrial accident. Previous estimates had put the death toll at 2,800. The plan also suggests that 250 deaths will occur annually over the next seven years as a result of the gas leak. The projection was the first official attempt at estimate the number of future deaths from the disaster. The government already has spent $ 46 million on relief for victims of the toxic cloud, which was released at 1 a.m. on Dec. 3, 1984 by the pesticide plant and spread over nearby shantytowns and into the city of <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>. Many gas victims have breathing problems that become progressively worse and ultimately cause death. Others will become ill with diseases whose symptoms include fever, vomiting and diarrhea. Union Carbide, headquartered in <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, faces two legal actions in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is suing it for $ 3 billion in damages in a civil action being heard in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> and has launched a criminal case against the company, several of its subsidiaries and current and former officers. On April 4, the <ORGANIZATION> Madhya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pradesh </ORGANIZATION> high court ordered <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 192 million in interim relief to gas victims. Federal and state coffers will provide the money for the new economic and medical assistance for the gas victims, state officials said. The interim relief, when paid, will be used for other purposes, they said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, told the company's annual meeting in <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION> on Wednesday the company has not decided whether to appeal the ruling The Indian government currently is sorting through 500,000 injury and loss claims to determine which are valid. More than 20,000 people are known to have sustained serious injuries in the leak. Among those scheduled to get financial aid under the new plan are 509 women widowed by the gas leak and 27 children who were orphaned. The plan sets aside $ 192,000 per year for financial relief to the families of those who die as a result of the disaster. Since the government pays $ 770 in lump-sum relief for each death, the government is anticipating 250 additional deaths each year for the next seven years, said state officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The plan does not explain the basis for the estimate, and said spending could be higher because `` it is not possible to assess the long-term damage.'' It also says a special unit will be set up to conduct scientific investigations into the long-range effects of the gas. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> contends the gas leak was caused by negligence. Union Carbide has said it resulted from sabotage by a distruntled employee. Efforts to reach an out-of-court settlement in the civil case failed last November, although both sides agreed to continue talking informally. According to sources close to the talks last fall, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> had offered slightly more than $ 500 million to try to settle the case. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said on Wednesday the company is spending between $ 7 million and $ 8 million annually on expenses from the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> litigation.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldfeder </PERSON> and other top executives are expected to leave the company soon after <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> assumes control, incoming Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON> says `` Most of the key executives have indicated they will take their golden parachutes,'' <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON>, now president of Campeau-owned <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` Golden parachutes'' are generous separation benefits commonly given senior executives of corporations that become takeover targets. While all decisions have not been made, <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON> said `` the top six or so'' <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> executives will probably depart. Employment contracts between the company and the top executives require that each receive three years' salary and 20 percent of individual pay for incentive compensation upon leaving the company. For <PERSON> Goldfeder </PERSON>, that amounts to $ 3.06 million, plus another $ 3.9 million in deferred compensation, or $ 6.96 million. Other top executives, their severance payments and deferred compensation listed in the proxy statement are <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer, $ 2.85 million; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burden </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, vice chairman, $ 2.31 million; <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Storey </PERSON>, vice chairman, $ 2.4 million; and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Questrom </PERSON>, vice chairman, $ 3.15 million. The figures do not include pensions and other benefits. During the heat of the takeover battle for Cincinnati-based Federated in February, the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> board of directors funded trust agreements totaling $ 28.35 million for top executives with severance contracts. <PERSON> Goldfeder </PERSON> had indicated earlier he planned to leave the company if a competing bid by <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were successful. A Federated representative said it was premature to comment on which of the company's senior managers would leave. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 73.30-a-share tender offer for all outstanding Federated stock will expire Friday at 5 p.m. Completion of the $ 6.75 billion tender offer will brings to an end Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s three-month struggle to acquire the nation's fifth-largest retailer. It also will be the first step in the merger of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> into <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> indicated that completing the merger would take at least a month, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing this week.

<HEAD>Tariff Cuts Planned For Wine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has decided to reduce import tariffs on wine from the present 100 percent to levels between 30 percent to 40 percent, officials said Thursday. But <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will reject <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for abolition of wine import quota restrictions, saying domestic wineries were not yet competitive and needed protection, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. The issue is just one of several that officials of both countries discuss in talks set to begin here Monday. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hopes to bring trade between the two countries more into balance. Last year the total amounted to $ 10 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s favor. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are also expected to press this country to lift its import ban on beef and further open its market for cigarettes and other American products and services. South Korean officials said the government planned to ease import inspections and facilitate customs clearance of wine imports. Under foreign pressure, particularly from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> began allowing imports of foreign wine last October. But it imposed quotas limiting imports to 20 percent of total domestic consumption this year, to 30 percent in 1989 and 40 percent in 1990 before fully opening the market in 1991. Korean imports of wine in the first quarter amounted to 116 kiloliters worth $ 334,000, according to official statistics. On the beef issue, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, leader of the main opposition party, said at a news conference Thursday that his party opposed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for abolition of the import ban. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said South Korean farmers `` should not be made scapegoats for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit.'' He said American beef sales here would do little to cut that deficit, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> instead should apply trade pressure on companies that export to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said in principle, his Party for Peace and Democracy supported the idea of free trade. `` But there is an exception for agricultural products. Even in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> there is a certain amount of protection concerning their farm products. This is the case everywhere,'' he said.

 The stock market pulled back a bit today in the face of rising interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.28 to 2,038.63 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 281 up, 674 down and 436 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 17.10 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.

<HEAD>Big Board Executive Says Stricter Disclosure Rules Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is working on rules that would require member brokerages to disclose the identity of every customer they conduct trades for, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> official has disclosed. Such rules, designed to strengthen the exchange's self-regulatory powers over trading abuses, could enmesh the securities industry in controversy because of the historic relationship of privacy between brokers and customers Under present rules, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s market surveillance unit must ask member firms for the identities of customers believed to be involved in questionable trading. Such requests are often excessively time-consuming. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, disclosed the plans for tighter rules Wednesday in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has been holding hearings into progress on remedies to prevent another stock market crash. The committee oversees the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates stock-futures trading. `` In the longer term, we will be proposing rules that will require, for regulatory purposes, that firms maintain a back-end process to identify beneficial owners. This will assist the exchange in performing its oversight and self-regulatory responsibilities,'' <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON> said. `` I want to emphasize the long-term nature of implementing such rules for identifying beneficial owners. That's because of the enormous amount of computer program changes that will have to be made by the firms themselves and the need to coordinate any new rules of this kind with other self-regulatory organizations, clearing and depository institutions and other relevant security industry participants,'' he said. Elaborating on the proposal in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON> said member firms would electronically report the identities of customers to the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, probably the day after the transaction, when buy and sell orders are matched during the period for settling trades. `` The market would n't know who the customer is,'' he was quoted as syaing. `` We would have it -LRB- the customer's identity -RRB- only for regulatory purposes.'' The Journal said <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON> indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is concerned about customer resistance and acknowledged that the proposal would require `` customer education.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s market-surveillance unit scrutinizes daily trading via computers that are designed to alert exchange investigators about transactions that suggest possible insider trading or market manipulation. If a suspicious trade is detected, the surveillance unit will call the brokers involved for more information and sometimes refers the material to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for further investigation.

 Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. None of the markets made much of a move in either direction in the early going and analysts attributed the quiet opening to a lack of fresh news. `` After a runup Tuesday in the soybean complex, I see the markets basically consolidating and trading in a choppy fashion, looking for some new fundamental information to give them some direction,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, irresistible cost-cutting force of the airline industry, has smacked into a seemingly immovable object at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> _ veteran Machinists leader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, a philosopher-mechanic who admits to being `` kind of a cornball sometimes,'' bases his strategies on his self-teachings in Yoga, Zen, the Bible and history. `` It's kind of a Gandhi approach, or <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. If you continue to be right, it's pretty hard for your adversary to overcome,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said in a recent interview. While the 55-year-old <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> native quotes <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON> and gets misty-eyed over the selfless nobility of King <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> Lancelot </PERSON> in `` Camelot,'' his favorite movie, his union members relish the more-familiar image of those same dark blue eyes flashing fire, and <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s voice rising in anger as he argues his points. Prominent in his small, cluttered office in an industrial-warehouse area west of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> is a plaque given him by his members showing <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, in a news photo, angrily pointing his finger during the Eastern shareholders meeting that approved <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s takeover. The president since 1979 of Machinists District 100, representing 12,000, or more than one-third, of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s employees, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> was blamed by former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> for forcing the 1986 sale of the troubled carrier to Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> once questioned <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s sanity. On April 13, <PERSON> Borman </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, appeared with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference aimed at countering a growing image that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> management is harassing employees and running unsafe airlines. `` The intransigence and unresponsiveness of the <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> are the most serious obstacles to a successful conclusion of Eastern's internal restructuring,'' <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> told reporters, citing his own experience at trying to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> leadership. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> responded: `` I would be delighted to sit down with <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and have an open discussion with the whole world watching. He can bring <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> along. I do n't think he'll ever have the courage to do that. He could n't deal with reality and the facts.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which teetered near bankruptcy, chilled many employees. In 16 years from his <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> base, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has become a bogeyman for airline unions, a reputation solidified in 1983 when he took his <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy reorganization. He voided contracts, slashed salaries, laid off a third of the work force and got the carrier flying again despite a pilots' strike. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, though, sent <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> a congratulatory telegram after the Eastern sale and asked for a meeting to discuss cooperation. He never got a response, he said. Instead, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and flight attendants union head <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> lost their seats on the board of directors; <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> had to turn in his directors' gold badge, which he wanted as a souvenir, and he lost flying privileges. He later received a letter threatening his firing for meeting with union members on company property. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> had frequent meetings with <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> during the 15 years at Eastern of the former astronaut _ who once awed <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> _ but he says he's never heard a word from <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and has gotten no more than `` a cold-fish handshake'' from Bakes. His letters to top executives, he says, are invariably answered by staffers. `` They've tried to diminish me to the lowest common denominator,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` But if there's anything that's driven our union together, it's the way they've tried to discredit me personally.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> believes that management, after failing to extract cuts of up to 50 percent in salaries for baggage handlers and other non-mechanics in his union, wanted to force a strike, keep the carrier flying with replacement workers, and crush the union. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> claims that rising numbers of firings and grievances have been designed to `` provoke a wildcat strike so they can fire everybody.'' `` But everyone has been beautiful in following our philosophy, our direction to keep doing a good job and not react to the harsh treatment,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, re-elected last year with 82 percent of the vote. There's been more to the Machinists' effort than passive resistance. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, who also has a 16-person union staff, has a consultant who keeps a database compiling any corporate activity by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, such as filings with federal agencies or court depositions, anything that provides information on the close-to-the-vest management. The union has attorneys in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> keeping up with myriad lawsuits, including a recent Machinists' suit charging management with trying to dismantle <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and violating security and federal labor laws, and asked for the courts to reverse the <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> takeover. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> won a federal ruling preventing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> from having an independent company take over some ground service work, and in March, another ruling blocked the announced spin-off of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s profitable <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle into a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. And persistent charges by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and Machinists were blamed by management for the current <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> safety inspections of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and for the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s unusual study of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to run airlines `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has run into a smart cookie,'' said <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> after losing a re-election bid in the flight attendants union. `` <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> is not a wild man _ he's a very deliberate, intelligent, motivated man who has been carefully portrayed otherwise by corporations fearful of his populist appeal.'' <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, a one-time <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> social historian and now director of promotions at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosenstiel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, says the conflict at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> `` is n't a clash of egos _ it's a clash of ideologies.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, a divorced father of three who says he last vacationed 10 years ago, is dedicating his 70-hour weeks -LRB- at $ 63,879 a year -RRB- these days to heading off <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> every place he can. Management insists that <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> is being stubbornly short-sighted and that the money-losing carrier ca n't go on with baggage handlers earning an average $ 47,000. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> says such averages are caused by mismanagement, because workers are working too much overtime. He charges management has intentionally created such averages to try to divide his union between the 6,000 mechanics and the other, lesser-skilled workers. `` When mechanics ask me why we do n't have separate unions, I tell them there are a lot of reasons, but the best one is that's what <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> wants,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said `` It's the first step in a divide-and-conquer strategy. I will never sacrifice those workers' quality of life. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> says he wants only what's best for his members and the airline he went to work for in 1956. He believes employees should have important influence, even controlling influence, in their companies. `` A lot of people identify me with <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quixote </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` But I never believe any of these dreams is impossible.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today renewed his opposition to a plant-closing provision of the trade bill, saying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should not legislate a requirement that companies warn workers of planned shutdowns. Shortly after his top trade negotiator repeated <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan to veto the just-passed trade legislation, the president was asked what quarrel he had with the worker-notification provision. `` As an old labor union president, I suggest that's a matter that belongs in the management-labor contracts between the unions and the people,'' the president said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was questioned as he greeted Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> for a private lunch. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said earlier that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto the massive trade bill but congressional Democrats called on the president to `` rethink his position'' and sign the measure. `` This bill is n't dead yet,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, told reporters `` The ball is in the White House court. If there is a demise of this bill it will occur at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, not here.'' House officials said it would be next week before the 1,000-page bill could be put into proper form and delivered to the White House. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would then have 10 days to either sign it or veto it. The bill would increase the power of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative to act against other countries that use unfair trade practices, make it easier to curb imports, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies, and increase agricultural subsidies. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will veto the bill because of the controversial plant-closing provision. He urged that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> eliminate that provision `` very quickly.'' `` We need a trade bill this year,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program `` There are a lot of good things in that legislation, so if a couple of necessary corrections are made and the bill comes back, I'm really quite confident the president would sign it,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said in another interview on `` CBS This Morning.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, however, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had only about 90 legislative days left this year and had a heavy schedule. Asked if it would accept proposed changes from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said, `` we're not spoon-fed from the White House. `` I hope the president will rethink his position and come down on the side of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, pleaded for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign the bill, which he said has overwhelming popularity across the country. `` There has to be a warm side to the president,'' he said. `` I ca n't believe it falls on deaf ears or a flinty heart.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s promise to veto the bill was made to `` captains of industry'' who would understand if he changed his mind. But <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> does n't want this bill. The White House does n't want any trade bill.'' The governments of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> today urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto the measure. There was also a warning from the European Economic Community of retaliatory action if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does n't kill it. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s chief government spokesman, <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>, said the bill which imposes sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> may hinder world economic development. `` The government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> strongly hopes that such a bill will not finally be enacted,'' said <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwang-kyung </PERSON> said the bill would hinder international trade and the government hopes the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` will take appropriate actions in line with its much publicized stand on the bill.'' <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> commissioner for external trade, said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> `` will react'' to measures in the bill it considers protectionist and harmful to European interests if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does not veto it. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill 63-36 Wednesday. That left Democrats at least three votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to enact their version over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s objections. The bill would get <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s signature, said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, if it were not for the provision, strongly backed by Democrats and labor, requiring companies to give workers 60 days notice of intended plant closings. Only 11 Republicans voted in favor of the measure produced after three years of congressional debate over soaring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficits. One Democrat voted against the measure _ Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., who criticized a provision easing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act `` I believe that this bill is dead,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> sponsor He and other supporters held out hope, however, that a revised version might pass later this year. The centerpiece of the bill would overhaul the system under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retaliates against trade law violations. It would transfer authority to act from the president to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative. It also would streamline the system under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposes import curbs to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries threatened by foreign-made goods. Other provisions range from billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies to repeal of the oil profits tax. Also included are sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kongsberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vapenfabrikk </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> for selling submarine-silencing equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Federal aid for those left jobless by imports would be expanded under the bill, which calls for a 0.15 percent import fee to pay for the program. Curbs on overseas shipment of high-tech equipment would be eased. The government would be barred from buying goods from countries that freeze out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports and the president empowered to halt any corporate merger or takeover on national security grounds.

<HEAD>Oil Cartel: Real Menace Or Just Bogeyman?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil prices are down and <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is turning to outsiders for help. For Western nations this raises a question: Is the cartel still a menace or only a harmless bogeyman? Less than a decade ago, oil-importing countries saw <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> as the devil, a dastardly outfit bent on carrying out economic terrorism against the West. Some still do. But gradually the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries appears to be shedding its bad guy image. Evidence was the meeting this week between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and seven independent oil-producing nations to discuss joint cuts in oil exports as a way of boosting prices. The outsiders are not part of the Western club of rich nations. They include partly industrialized <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, Marxist <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, two Arab countries and some relative newcomers to oil-exporting status. Yet <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> seems to have become more palatable even to some richer countries. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> over the past year has established close ties to the cartel, and in 1987 the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, comprised of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and nine other European nations, held an initial `` seminar'' with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> representatives to exchange views. The seven non-OPEC countries did not come to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> because of a new-found fondness for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> or a desire to become members. They simply are so troubled by volatile oil prices that they will try nearly anything to stabilize the market. Before the startling oil-price spirals of the 1970s began unwinding six years ago, any formal deals between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and other oil producers would have seemed preposterous. For one thing, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was n't interested. As recently as 1978 it controlled two-thirds of the non-Communist world's oil supplies. Prices were high and most people thought they'd go much higher. Oil at $ 100 a barrel seemed a good bet for the late 1980s. Then came the oil glut of the early 1980s. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s fortunes took a sharp turn as new oil-exporting powers such as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> began undercutting <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> prices and boosting their sales. Now the non-OPEC oil producers pump about 28 million barrels a day while <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s output has dropped to 17.5 million barrels a day from its 1978 peak of about 31 million barrels daily. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has come to the conclusion that this trend must not continue. So it has moderated its goals, saying it only wants to keep oil prices at a `` reasonable'' level, and that all oil-producing countries must help achieve this. `` <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is not against anybody,'' says <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grisanti </PERSON>, the oil minister of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, which was one of five founding members of the organization in 1960. `` <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is trying to stabilize the oil market, and this stability is in the interests of everybody, including consumers,'' he told reporters this week in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The message seems to be working. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> contacts with non-OPEC countries, particularly in the Third World, are now commonplace. Although they had no direct role in this week's <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meetings, the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> sent officials to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to consult privately with key <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> representatives. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that regulates the state's oil industry, says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has nothing to fear from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and should establish close ties to the cartel. `` Right now <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is not in the position to do something that would be harmful to us,'' he said in an interview. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration refuses to deal openly with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. It maintains that governments should not interfere in the setting of oil prices or production rates. This also is the official policy of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, a Paris-based body representing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 20 other Western industrialized nations. The agency was set up after the 1973 Arab oil embargo against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an event that propelled <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to instant status as an oil power. Part of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s image problem is linked to the makeup of the group. Some countries with close bilateral ties to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, such as <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, say they honestly want to avoid a repeat of the 1970s oil price shocks because it would only mean another cycle of boom and bust in their countries. But other members, mainly <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, have not abandoned the aim of driving prices high quickly and getting the most out of a resource the West ca n't do without. In recent years the Saudi view has prevailed. But in much of the West, doubts persist about whether <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would stick to its moderate pricing stance if the world supply glut ended and <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> regained the leverage to send prices skyrocketing.

<HEAD>European, Asian Officials Urge Reagan Veto of Trade Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Asian and European Common Market officials are urging President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto the wide-ranging trade bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, warning that the measure likely would invite retaliation harmful to the world economy. The bill, which was passed Wednesday and is headed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his signature, toughens <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliatory measures against countries engaged in unfair trade practices. It provoked street demonstrations by students in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, but drew a mild reaction in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, where officials said the British colony could adust to the measure. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners were encouraged because the bill was n't passed by sufficient votes to override a veto. But that did not stop them from pressing their cases. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> strongly fears that if the bill is enacted in its present form, it will have a serious impact on bilateral and multilateral economic cooperation and may hinder the development of the world economy,'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s chief government spokesman <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> totaled $ 50.9 billion last year. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s commissioner for external trade, <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, said in a statement that the trading bloc will use its rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, `` each time its interests are harmed by the unilateral measures taken by the American authorities.'' He made that threat contingent on whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> successfully vetoes the bill. South Korean Trade and Industry Minister <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Byong-wha </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> that the measure would invite retaliation, if it became law, adding: `` We firmly believe the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president will veto it as he repeatedly confirmed.'' Foreign Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwang-kyung </PERSON> said the bill contained protectionist provisions that `` might undermine an orderly growth of international trade.'' The bill `` will hamper not only the liberalization efforts of the -LRB- South Korean -RRB- government, but also the smooth growing of the Korea-U.S. economic and trade relationship,'' he added. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> passed the trade legislation April 21 and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved by a 63-36 vote, just under the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. The legislation also imposes trade sanctions against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for the sale by its subsidiary of sensitive equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> The sales violated rules of the <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, a Paris-based group that regulates Western high-technology exports to communist nations. <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, said he regretted the <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> sanctions, but that <ORGANIZATION> MITI </ORGANIZATION> appreciates `` the fact that more than one third of the total <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted against the bill.'' <PERSON> Joichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoi </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION>, which stands to lose more than $ 50 million this year if the bill becomes law, also expressed strong disappointment. `` <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> was neither involved in, nor had any knowledge of, the misconduct by <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Aoi </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Thus, we have been insisting that it would be grossly unfair to punish <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> told reporters that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> was `` waiting to see what happens next'' before making any specific moves. The spokeswoman said that the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> objects to a number of provisions in the trade bill which it considers to be protectionist and to harm EEC interests. One would widen the power of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative to investigate and order retaliatory action against alleged unfair trade practices. Another would threaten foreign companies' access to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> telecommunications market, if their governments do not reduce barriers to entry by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to their markets. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, about 1,500 students from five schools gathered at <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and hurled firebombs at riot police in a protest denouncing the government and what they called `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aggression.'' This country posted a trade surplus of nearly $ 10 billion with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, Director of Trade <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sze </PERSON> said the measure `` is a much better bill than the original one.'' `` Many of the provisions which we were concerned about have either been improved or dropped completely,'' he said, `` So from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s perspective I think it's a bill that we can live with,'' <PERSON> Sze </PERSON> said in an interview with government-run Radio Television <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accrued a $ 6.5 billion deficit in trade with <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> last year.

 The stock market lost ground today, faced with rising interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.48 points to 2,044.43 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 553 up, 831 down and 474 unchanged. Prices of long-term government bonds showed losses approaching $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value in early activity today, putting their yields in the neighborhood of 9.05 to 9.10 percent.

The company reported net income of $ 6.9 million or 17 cents per share for the first quarter of 1988, down from $ 33.7 million or 86 cents per share last year. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Teets </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said there was a seasonal loss of $ 5.9 million or 16 cents per share from Greyhound's 22.5 percent equity in <ORGANIZATION> GLI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company that bought Greyhound Lines in March 1987 for $ 350 million. Greyhound is a diversified company that produces items ranging from food to laundry soap. First-quarter revenues totaled $ 701 million, up from $ 493 million a year earlier. Income in continuing operations rose 44 percent to $ 12.8 millin or 33 cents per share in the first quarter compared to $ 8.9 million or 22 cents per share in 1987, Greyhound said. `` Results of comparable operations were well ahead of last year and almost all of our major businesses were on or ahead of plan,'' <PERSON> Teets </PERSON> said. `` Most of our operating companies showed substantial improvements in profitability in the first quarter.'' <PERSON> Teets </PERSON> said the revenue increase resulted primarily from the <ORGANIZATION> Dobbs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> and Airport Services acquisition in November 1987 and the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>' transit bus and repair parts business last May.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plans to move slowly and cautiously in finding ways to invest $ 3 billion it received from <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Liedtke </PERSON> told shareholders Thursday at the company's annual meeting. `` The short of it is, we have n't fully decided on the right course,'' <PERSON> Liedtke </PERSON> said. `` It would avail our shareholders and our employees little to have won this settlement only to lose a portion of its value through hasty or ill-considered actions.'' <PERSON> Liedtke </PERSON>, who is giving up his position as <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer but remaining as chairman, said the board would be considering a number of investments in coming months. During a news conference following the shareholders meeting, neither <PERSON> Liedtke </PERSON> nor <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Randal </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> would offer many specifics other than to say the company would strive toward a balance between acquisitions of oil and gas reserves, and a balance between exploration and production activities and refining and marketing activities. <PERSON> Liedtke </PERSON> said top company officials had a list of 25-30 companies under consideration for investment, of which about six have been examined in detail. Publicity about the huge payment to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> had brought with it a deluge of suggestions of how the money should be spent, <PERSON> Liedtke </PERSON> said. `` They range all over the place,'' he said. `` One man in <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> wants to take his wife to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>.'' After the meeting, the company announced that its first-quarter earnings jumped 71 percent, bolstered by higher refinery margins and a one-time gain from the early redemption of a bond issue. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 20.7 million, or 41 cents per share, compared with $ 12.1 million, or 20 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. During the first quarter, the company experienced an after-tax gain of $ 6.9 million, or 17 cents per share, through an early debenture redemption. Revenues totaled $ 485 million, compared with $ 445 million for the same period in 1987, the company said. Higher prices for natural gas and larger sales volumes bolstered a gain in <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s oil and gas segment to $ 27 million from $ 17.5 million in the 1987 first quarter, it said. Operating income from the company's products division fell to $ 28.4 million from $ 33 million during the same period in 1987, mostly due to lower sales volumes and margins on its motor oil, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> said. First quarter operating income from the company's sulphur division was $ 11.9 million, down from $ 16.5 million during the first three months of 1987, the company said. <PERSON> Liedtke </PERSON>, who has been <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer for 35 years, received a standing ovation following his address to shareholders. Afterward, he told reporters he planned to spend more time with his family, as well as reading and traveling, in the years ahead.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter earnings set a world auto industry record for a single quarter, and industry analysts predicted Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> will top competitors in profitability throughout 1988. The nation's second-largest automaker said Thursday it earned $ 1.623 billion, or $ 3.31 a share, on sales of $ 20.74 billion in the first three months of 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter earnings were up 8.8 percent from $ 1.49 billion, or $ 2.87 a share earned in the first quarter of 1987 on sales of $ 18.14 billion. The previous quarterly earnings record was set by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest automaker, with $ 1.614 billion in profits in first-quarter 1984. In the first quarter of this year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 1.09 billion, or $ 3.11 a share, on sales of $ 26.44 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 3 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker, earned $ 183.7 million, or 83 cents a share, on sales of $ 7.8 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said a 10.2 percent drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> earnings from a year ago, caused by costs of buyer incentive campaigns and new-product launches, was offset by a nearly 76 percent jump in overseas earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 1.04 billion in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the first quarter, down from $ 1.16 billion a year ago. Outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 580 million, up from $ 330 million in first-quarter 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Our first-quarter earnings reflect the good balance of the overall <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> team effort,'' the company said in a statement attributed to Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON>. `` With increasingly competitive worldwide automotive markets, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> must continue to improve quality and operating efficiency, as well as offer customers good value in products,'' they said. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> set a world industry earnings record for a single year with a profit of $ 4.63 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also was the top-earning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker in 1986, earning $ 3.29 billion and outperforming <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> for the first time since the 1920s. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also continues to sit on a $ 10 billion cash reserve. The company is seeking a major acquisition that, while outside the auto industry itself, might complement <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s main business. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> treasurer and vice president for finance, said the company is searching patiently and carefully for either one main acquisition or a coordinated series of smaller purchases, but gave no further details. <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> declined to project <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> earnings for the rest of 1988 but said he believes industrywide <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of imported and domestic vehicles may top current predictions of about 15 million. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said the incentives and new-product launches, while costly, helped boost sales and increase <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car market 1.8 percentage points to 21.8 percent in the first quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> truck market grew slightly from first-quarter 1987 to 29.7 percent. Strong sales left <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> with lower-than-average inventories of unsold vehicles, the company said. Industry analysts predicted <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> would continue to lead the industry in earnings throughout 1988, partly because it has boosted production schedules for the second half of the year. `` <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s gross profit per unit and manufacturing profit per unit are far and away better than <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s sales include a healthy percentage of high-profit vehicles while it has the best control over costs in the industry. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said its Financial Services Group earnings were below those of a year ago because of lower profits at First Nationwide. However, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> earned a record $ 200 million in the quarter, up 2 percent from a year ago. Its foreign performance was boosted in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by strong sales throughout the industry, improved profit margins and favorable exchange rates contributed $ 60 million toward offsetting the $ 100 million cost of a two-week strike at a British plant, <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Autolatina </ORGANIZATION> joint venture <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> formed in July 1987 helped earnings by reducing operating costs and cutting interest expenses and benefited from improvements in the Brazilian economy.

 <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday reported a 64 percent first quarter revenue increase to $ 363.7 million, including the operations of <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from the merger of the two companies in February. The company reported net income of $ 14.5 million for the quarter ending April 4, a 22 percent increase over $ 11.9 million for the same period last year. Revenues increased from $ 221.7 million in the first quarter of 1987. Per share earnings for the period were 30 cents, compared with 24 cents for the same period last year.

Prime also said its first quarter net income figure excludes an operating loss incurred by <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> from Jan. 1 to Feb. 5. Prime's $ 435 million purchase of outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> shares made the new company second only to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in computer-aided design and manufacturing. In a statement, Prime president <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> attributed the earnings increase to strong demand for the company's new 4000 Series mid-range systems and <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION>'s CADDS product line.

 The stock market declined slightly today, faced with rising interest rates. Prices of long-term government bonds showed losses of about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value today, putting their yields in the neighborhood of 9.05 to 9.10 percent. Analysts said the latest data on unemployment claims prompted expectations that employment statistics for April will show continued strength in the economy. That, in turn, would be viewed by some Wall Streeters as an added bit of impetus for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to consider tightening credit against the possibility of increasing inflationary pressures. Brokers noted that the volume of stock trading remained light, suggesting that the market was still suffering more from caution than from any widespread selling.

 <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported strong first quarter earnings Thursday, attributing the performance to its sale of <ORGANIZATION> Westin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Resorts and increased traffic aboard the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of nearly $ 576.9 million, or $ 12.02 a share, for the first three months of 1988, compared with a net loss of more than $ 30.5 million, or 60 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced 60th-birthday fare cuts Thursday that executives hope will restore a ridership that has lagged since federal inspectors launched a safety check of the troubled carrier's planes. `` We have been dented in terms of bookings'' since the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month started inspecting <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 267 planes, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for the Miami-based carrier. `` You know we're not going to talk about specifics. We took some bumps,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. `` And this -LRB- fare cuts -RRB- in part is due to this. `` There will be some who wo n't come back,'' he said, estimating that Eastern flies 100,000 passengers daily and hopes to increase that. The carrier has been deeply hurt by large losses and persistent labor hostility, compounded by recurring questions about its safety practices. Before uncorking champagne and cutting a cake topped with a huge `` 60'' candle in honor of the carrier's May 1 birthday, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s MaxSaver fares between May 1 and June 15 will be rolled back to prices set when the fare was created in February 1987. Under the reductions, a <LOCATION> Miami-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> flight with a current lowest price of $ 104 would cost $ 79 one way. A $ 119 one-way Miami-Boston fare will cost $ 89. Other pricing gimmicks are first-class seats for $ 60 roundtrip over the cost of domestic MaxSaver fares; letting people born on May 1 fly free if accompanied by a passenger paying a MaxSaver fare; allowing MaxSaver fare flyers to bring a companion for $ 60 more each way, on most flights; and offering a `` very frequent flyer'' program. Under that program, people who take 60 Eastern flights -LRB- excluding its shuttle -RRB- between May 1 and June 30 will receive unlimited travel for a year, or can treat 30 friends to a free domestic Eastern flight. `` It's a relatively slow travel period. We're awaiting the summer rush. We're trying to get people out of their cars, out of their homes,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` The direction we're taking is contrary'' to the airline industry, he added. `` How other carriers are going to react I do n't know. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which like <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, will generally not match the fares, said spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` We are only going to match in certain selective markets where we are competitive with Eastern. For the most part we will not be matching their fare action,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` We currently have a good pricing structure and do n't see a need to change it.'' Eastern was born in 1928 as <ORGANIZATION> Pitcairn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>, ferrying mail at night under a contract with the federal government. On hand at the news conference-birthday celebration Thursday was <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who flew <ORGANIZATION> Pitcairn </ORGANIZATION>'s inaugural flight on May 1, 1928.

 The dollar fell against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar Thursday in light, end-of-the-month activity. Gold prices were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 450 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, compared with $ 450.80 late Wednesday. Traders said the dollar continued to move in a very narrow range. `` There's really nothing going on,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, chief foreign exchange dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the day's activity centered on the British pound, which traders sold ahead of the British government's release of its monthly trade report on Friday. `` Fear that the numbers would be bad prompted some selling of sterling,'' said <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that sterling was the only currency to move out of its trading range. Dealers said there was little positioning going on ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s release on Friday of its index of leading economic indicators for March. The dollar finished mostly lower in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where trading also was quiet. Dealers there were reconciling their positions at the end of the month. `` It's more position-squaring than anything else,'' said a trader at a major German bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` People do n't feel like keeping a high profile around the end of the month.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.17 yen to a closing 124.82 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was slightly lower at 124.65 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar closed at 124.515 yen, down from 124.865 yen on Wednesday.

 Stock prices sagged Thursday in the slowest session of the year on Wall Street. Analysts said a rise in interest rates put an added damper on an already wary and listless market. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 6.63 to 2,041.28, ending a run of five consecutive gains that added up to 62.50 points. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in the daily tally of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed trading, with 621 up, 850 down and 483 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 128.68 million shares, down from 133.81 million Wednesday and the lightest total since 111.58 million were traded last Dec. 29. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index lost .61 to 148.33. Prices of long-term government bonds showed losses of about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the neighborhood of 9.05 to 9.10 percent. Analysts said the latest data on unemployment claims prompted expectations that employment statistics for April will show continued strength in the economy. That, in turn, would be viewed by some Wall Streeters as an added bit of impetus for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to consider tightening credit against the possibility of increasing inflationary pressures. Brokers noted that the slow pace of activity suggested that the market was still suffering more from caution than from any wholesale selling. But that was small consolation to traders who have watched stocks make little progress over the past several weeks, except for pockets of takeover activity and brief, sharp swings attributed to computer program-driven trading. The best gainer on Thursday's active list was <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, up 5 -RRB- at 61 -LCB- on volume of more than 3.3 million shares. The company, which has been resisting the takeover advances of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, said it agreed to a $ 61-a-share buyout by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>, which reported higher first-quarter earnings, eked out a -LRB- - point gain to 47 Losers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, off ~ at 113 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, down 1 \ at 75 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, down 1 -LRB- at 51 \, and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION>, down -RRB- at Banc One rose 1 \ to 23 The stock was added to <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index, prompting buying by index funds set up to duplicate as closely as possible the performance of the 500. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 9.19 billion, or 0.35 percent, in value. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 151.93 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell 1.45 to 306.09, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.19 at 262.61. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged up .10 to 378.77. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 301.50, up .34.

<HEAD>Posts Wider Loss Due to Higher Interest Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the publishing, insurance and theme park concern, said Thursday its loss widened in the first quarter when its interest costs soared sixfold. But the company's operating loss narrowed from a year ago, and officials noted that the first quarter often is weak because of the seasonality of the educational publishing and amusement park businesses. The higher interest expenses resulted from heavy borrowing last year as the company financed a recapitalization to thwart a hostile takeover effort. <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said it lost $ 35.5 million in the three months ended March 31 in contrast to a loss of $ 9.4 million in the same quarter last year. Its revenue for the quarter rose 7.4 percent to $ 306.7 million from $ 285.7 million a year earlier. The company said its operating loss before the recapitalization charges narrowed to $ 13.5 million from $ 47.3 million a year earlier. `` We are pleased with the results because have been able to reduce our first quarter operating loss by about 70 percent from last year,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berardi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON>'s vice president and treasurer. <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON>'s interest expense climbed six-fold to $ 67.2 million from $ 11.2 million a year earlier. It said revenue from its publishing operations rose 2 percent to $ 128.5 million for the quarter, but its loss from publishing operations narrowed to $ 26.6 million from $ 39.2 million. The company is a leading publisher of school textbooks, and the first quarter is normally weak because of ordering patterns in that business. Revenue from theme parks, including the Sea World parks in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, rose 26.8 percent to $ 61.0 million, while income from park operations fell 7.2 percent to $ 4.0 million. Insurance revenue rose 4.5 percent to $ 117.1 million and the company reported income of $ 10.9 million from insurance operations in contrast to a loss of $ 6.6 million a year earlier that included a pretax charge of $ 15.2 million for the relocation of the company's insurance operations to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The latest results also included a $ 3.2 million gain on the sale of land.

 After declining sharply in 1986 mostly due to falling world oil prices, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s troubled economy grew modestly last year but its chronic inflation also rose, the nation's central bank reported Thursday. In its annual report, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product grew by 1.4 percent in 1987, after contracting by 4 percent the previous year. Industrial production during 1987 rose by 2.9 percent. Among the best performing components, mining rose 6.9 percent, electrical production 6.1 percent, manufacture 2.1 percent and contruction 2.2 percent. Services during the year rose 1.2 percent, but agriculture dropped by 0.3 percent. According to the report, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s balance of payments similarly improved from a deficit of $ 1.7 billion in 1986 to a surplus of $ 3.9 billion last year as a result of a substantial improvement in the terms of the country's trade structure. Income from non-petroleum exports during that period rose by an unprecedented 24 percent as a result of a new overall drive to sell more abroad, and income from petroleum exports rose 37 percent, while imports dropped by 7 percent and foreign debt service payments by 2 percent. At $ 105 billion, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s is the biggest foreign debt among developing nations after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Direct foreign investments in 1987 totaled $ 3.2 billion, and the country showed a net foreign currency income of $ 1.199 billion, while foreign currency reserves rose by $ 6.9 billion to $ 13.7 billion by the end of 1987. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Petricioli </PERSON> said last week <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign currency reserves currently stand at an all-time high of more than $ 16 billion But the annual rate of inflation _ as measured by the consumer price index _ soared from 105.7 percent in 1986 to 159.2 percent last year, the report said, sharply reducing the purchasing power of salaries, which have not kept pace. The government put into effect an Economic Solidarity Pact in December, intended to reduce monthly inflation to 1 to 2 percent by the end of 1988. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> said recently that the target of 2 percent monthly inflation should be reached by midyear.

<TEXT>
 All three of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s measures of the nation's money supply rose in mid-April, the central bank said Thursday The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said its narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose $ 300 million in the week ended April 18 to a seasonally adjusted $ 766.6 billion from $ 766.3 billion the previous week. It said the measure known as M2 rose $ 600 million to a seasonally adjusted $ 2,991.5 billion from $ 2,990.9 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased $ 1.3 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,760.1 billion from $ 3,758.8 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. Some economists say changes in the money supply provide clues about trends in inflation. But the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has appeared to place less emphasis on money supply growth in recent years than it did earlier this decade. In setting its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> says it monitors the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates as well as changes in M2 and M3 In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks rose $ 234 million in the week ended April 20, compared with a decline of $ 1.36 billion a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> averaged $ 300 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 515 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 276.3 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from $ 274.1 billion two weeks earlier

 <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, spurning a takeover by rival <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that would have created the nation's largest supermarket chain, agreed Thursday to a $ 2.2 billion merger with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm The announcement sent Lucky's stock climbing $ 5.375 to close at $ 61.50 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> _ nearly twice its value a month ago when <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> made its offer. More than 3.3 million Lucky shares were bought and sold, making it one of the most actively traded issues. The $ 61-per-share deal is worth about $ 600 million more than the initial $ 45-per-share offer by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> suitor sweetened the offer to $ 60 earlier Thursday but was again rebuffed. An analyst said Lucky's consent to be acquired by the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Gibbons </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON> is unlikely to end the bidding war for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s second-largest grocery chain. Under the agreement, a company formed by <ORGANIZATION> Gibbons </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON> will launch a cash tender offer next Wednesday to acquire 35.7 million shares of Lucky shares _ 92 percent of the shares outstanding _ for $ 61 per share. Following completion of the tender offer, the two companies will merge and the remaining stockholders will receive preferred stock with a stated value of up to $ 7 for each of their shares, according to a joint announcement by both companies. Lucky stock climbed $ 5 a share to $ 61.125 in heavy trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> midway through the session. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON> said it would retain current Lucky management and employees and maintain its corporate headquarters in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, 25 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We believe it -LRB- Lucky -RRB- is the pre-eminent supermarket company in the areas of its operations,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a partner in <LOCATION> Gibbons </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON>. The investment firm said it had received a `` highly confident'' letter from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on the probability of financing. Based upon proposals from commercial banks, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said it expects bank financing to be committed shortly. Lucky's board of directors said it decided to accept the offer over <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>' bid based on the opinion of <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, financial advisers to the company. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said, `` We believe that the the transaction ... is very beneficial to our stockholders and allows Lucky to continue with its plans for growth.'' The offer is subject to financing, a majority of Lucky shares being tendered and other conditions.

But he said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> could remain in the bidding. He said Lucky's retail base and strong management make it a worthwhile target. Another <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area grocery giant, Oakland-based <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, took a similar action and went private in an acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. The offer from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> in late March came just 17 months after Lucky derailed a hostile takeover attempt by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Coffee futures prices tumbled Thursday on indications that an expected cut in export quotas would not cause a tightening of available supplies of unroasted beans, analysts said. On other markets, prices for future delivery of oil, precious metals, livestock, meat, grains, soybeans and stock-index futures all retreated. Coffee traders on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> had been worried that falling prices would trigger an automatic reduction in export quotas under the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s price-support system. But the <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday that shipments from October through March were at their lowest level in six years, indicating some producer countries had held back coffee and undershipped their export quotas for the six-month period, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Under ICO rules, those countries will be required to make up the 2-million-bag difference during the second half of the <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> marketing year, `` so supplies are going to be even larger than people had been anticipating,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON> said. `` Now people are no longer afraid that a quota cut would make supplies too tight,'' she said. `` Even with a quota cut, supplies are going to be pretty plentiful this quarter.'' With the new supply outlook, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> roasters curtailed their buying of coffee futures and prices fell rapidly, she said. The active contract, for delivery in July, tumbled 1.48 cents, settling at $ 1.328 a pound. Crude oil futures drifted lower throughout the day on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, then dropped below $ 18 a barrel near the close as the market registered doubt that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members would agree to reduce their crude oil exports. Representatives of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries began meeting Thursday afternoon in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, on a proposal to cut their exports by 5 percent in an attempt to boost prices. Six independent oil-producing nations have agreed to reduce their exports by 5 percent if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will do likewise. `` The market has decided it's going to be disappointed regardless of what happens at the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meetings,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 29 cents lower with June at $ 17.98 a barrel; heating oil was .69 cent to .80 cent lower with May at 50.97 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .53 cent to .85 cent lower with May at 51.83 cents a gallon Gold and silver futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in reaction to the slide in oil futures, analysts said. Gold settled $ 1.70 lower across the board with June at $ 452.60 a troy ounce; silver was 2.5 cents to 3.4 cents lower with May at $ 6.466 a troy ounce. Cattle futures prices sank on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a delayed reaction to last week's government reports showing larger-than-expected numbers of cattle being fattened for slaughter. Cattle futures had risen the previous two days on strong cash markets but `` I think the reality of the report is taking hold,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` It shows a lot more cattle to be marketed in May and June.'' Heavy movement of hogs to market pressured hog and pork-belly futures, he said. Live cattle settled .67 cent lower to .45 cent higher with June at 70.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .30 cent lower with April at 80.65 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent to .50 cent lower with June at 48.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .32 cent to 1.20 cents lower with May at 51.47 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as the outlook for crop planting and winter wheat harvesting improved. Six-to-10 day forecasts by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and private forecasters called for dry weather for planting of corn and soybeans in the Corn Belt early next week followed by rain, which will benefit crops already planted, especially oats and spring wheat, analysts said. The weather forecasts also were favorable for the winter wheat harvest, which is under way in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Wheat settled 3 -LCB- cents to 4 cents lower with May at $ 3.06 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 2.00 \ a bushel; oats were 3 \ cents to 6 cents lower with May at $ 1.61 a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents lower to \ cent higher with May at $ 6.75 -RCB- a Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .60 point lower at 263.40.

 <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter earnings rose 19 percent compared with the year-ago period partly because of increased revenues in the transport aircraft operation, the company said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 51.2 million, or $ 1.33 per share, on revenues of $ 3.24 billion in the first quarter. Earnings in the same quarter last year were $ 43 million, or $ 1.06 per share, on revenues of $ 3.03 billion, the company said. Transport aircraft revenues increased sharply because the company delivered 24 MD-80 aircraft in the first quarter of this year, compared with earlier rates of 12 planes a year. Combat aircraft earnings also increased, but the increase was more than offset by the impact of an early retirement program instituted in 1987, the company said. The voluntary early retirement program resulted in a one-time, pre-tax charge of $ 66 million, or 93 cents a share. The company said it has invested heavily to deveop the MD-11 tri-jet and to compete for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s advanced tactical fighter program. Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON>, who reported the earnings at the company's annual shareholders meeting, said <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> is considering a cooperative agreement with the European aircraft manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to develop a family of aircraft that could compete successfully with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the current leader in the commercial aircraft industry. He described negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> as very preliminary, complicated and delicate, adding that there was `` absolutely no assurance that we will come to an agreement any time soon.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is misleading the public by exaggerating the health benefits of eating oat cereal, a consumer group said Thursday in a complaint to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman for the Chicago-based company said the complaint is without merit and that the claims have scientific backing. The Center for Science in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit advocacy group, accused <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> of running magazine advertisements that overstate the contribution of Quaker Oats and Oat Bran in reducing the risk of heart disease. The ads, featuring actor <PERSON> Wilford </PERSON> <PERSON> Brimley </PERSON>, recommend lowering fat intake and adding complex carbohydrates and fiber to the diet. But the center objected to part of the ads saying clinical studies showed serum-cholesterol levels dropped an average of nearly 10 percent among people who ate <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> daily as part of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. `` The Brimley ads make the reader believe that <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> are some type of magic wand,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverglade </PERSON>, the center's legal director `` In fact, most of the improvement in the health of individuals who eat <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> was due to also eating a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet.'' He said oat cereal, by itself, accounted for only a 3 percent chloresterol reduction and a corresponding decline of 6 percent in the risk of heart disease, `` a modest to minimal improvement ... of borderline significance.'' `` Any health-related claim made in food advertising needs to be supported by reliable scientific evidence,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottrell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of corporate communications. `` In this case, we feel that we have it.'' A heart-disease specialist at the National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said he had not seen the ads and did not want to take sides. `` Nobody would get too excited if you reduced the risk by that amount,'' Dr. Basil <PERSON> Rifkind </PERSON> said. `` On the other hand, if you look at it in population terms, we usually say that even small reductions in chloresterol could be meaningful.'' The center asked the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to order Quaker to discontinue the ads and replace them with ones that would `` correct any misimpressions that consumers have derived from the original advertising campaign.'' `` We do n't think we misled the reader in any way,'' <PERSON> Bottrell </PERSON> said, adding the study Quaker cited was the most conservative among several supporting its claims. `` The claim we're making in the ad clearly talks about eating oats as part of a reduced-fat, reduced-chloresterol diet,'' he said. `` We're not ascribing the overall benefit to oats alone.'' <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said the commission had no immediate comment on the complaint and would not speculate on if or when it would take action. `` We take letters of this type quite seriously,'' she said. `` So there is no particular time limit for reaching a resolution.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest natural gas transmission company, said Thursday it was considering the sale of its oil and gas subsidiary, one of the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> independent oil and gas concerns. `` Based upon prices paid in recent transactions for oil and gas reserves, the sale of all or part of EOG -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- would strengthen substantially <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION>'s financial position and provide the flexibility to pursue very attractive opportunities we see in the energy business,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> chairman. <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas had reserves of 1.42 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 42.3 million barrels of oil as of the end of 1987. For the entire year, it sold an average of 343 million cubic feet of natural gas and 12,000 barrels of oil per day. For the first three months of 1988, that rate has risen to 399 million cubic feet of gas and 13,000 barrels of oil, the company said. `` Assuming completion of a sale, we will be realizing for our shareholders the tremendous value inherent in these assets under current favorable market conditions,'' Lay said. He said proceeds from a sale would be used to reduce <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION>'s indebtedness and interest expense and enhance near-term earnings and future cash flow Lay, speaking at <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting Thursday, said debt reduction was a major goal for 1988. Debt as a percentage of capitalization stood at 75.6 at the end of 1987 and was reduced to 67 percent by the end of the first quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> earlier Thursday reported first-quarter earnings of $ 69.4 million, or $ 1.20 per share, compared with $ 62.7 million, or $ 1.06 per share, for the year-earlier period. `` Among the primary causes was a return to more normal winter temperature patterns than the relatively warm heating seasons of the last three years,'' Lay said. `` The colder weather, resulting in increased natural gas use, was coupled with higher average prices for gas, which also proved beneficial to earnings.'' In releasing the financial figures, the company restated earnings for 1987 to reflect adoption of changed accounting rules, reducing 1987's reported first quarter earnings by $ 3.9 million, reflecting a lower federal income tax benefit due to a tax rate change relative to depreciation and amortization expenses.

 <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> asked a federal bankruptcy judge Thursday for an eight-month extension to file its reorganization plan, although the judge has indicated he was n't inclined to grant one. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also outlined four reorganization options it was considering, including formation of a federally-regulated holding company so it could start charging ratepayers for its 36 percent share of the stalled, $ 5.3 billion <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant. Bankruptcy law gives a debtor the exclusive right to propose a reorganization plan for 120 days after it files for protection from creditors. After that period, creditors may file alternative proposals. Public Service's exclusivity period ends May 27. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> for an extension to next Jan. 27, and for a hearing on its request on May 20. During a procedural hearing in February, <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> had indicated he was not inclined to grant an extension. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s largest power company, on Jan. 28 became the first big investor-owned electric utility to seek bankruptcy protection since the Depression. The utility sought protection on the grounds it was financially unable to continue operating without being able to recoup its Seabrook investment. State law prohibited <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> from charging customers for its share of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> until the plant was operating commercially. Operation of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> has been delayed by evacuation planning snags. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the its unusual case mandated the extension of the usual exclusivity period. `` The size, complexity and novelty of this case have prevented the development of meaningful information, let alone meaningful negotiations, within the 120-day plan exclusivity period ... which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> designed for a case of average size and complexity,'' the company said. `` Admittedly, an eight-month extension is more than is normally requested or granted, but this is not a normal case.'' <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also said there likely would be at least 10 major parties in the negotiations, but not all appeared ready to start the talks. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also outlined reorganization options it is considering: selling the company as a whole; internal reorganization into a federally-regulated holding company; reorganizing to remain under state regulation; and liquidation. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> noted that two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> utilities had expressed interest in buying its non-Seabrook assets. The company estimated it would take four to six months to complete preparations for such a sale and reach a point where it could compare an acquisition offer to other reorganization options. Regarding the holding company option, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> noted that a principal cause of its financial problems was the state law barring it from charging ratepayers for its Seabrook investment until the plant operates commercially. But the company noted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates wholesale electricity, allows charges for construction work in progress, or CWIP, for abandoned or canceled power plants. `` A restructuring of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s operations to provide for the sale of electricity at wholesale under <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION> regulation could thus significantly increase <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s revenues and value,'' the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> sought bankruptcy protection two days after the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> denied an emergency rate increase by upholding the `` anti-CWIP'' law. The company last month appealed the ruling to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.
