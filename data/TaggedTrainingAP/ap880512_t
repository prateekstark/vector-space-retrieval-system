 The actors <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Montand </PERSON> likes are the kind of actor he is himself. `` I admire <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> very much,'' he said. `` I like <LOCATION> Columbo </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>. I like this kind of actors who become older but they do n't lose their youth, really. They go on with some charm and are human beings. They do n't destroy themselves with face lifts, which are terrible.'' <PERSON> Montand </PERSON> was recently in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to receive this year's tribute from the <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the 17th person to be honored and the first Frenchman. His two most recent films are `` Jean de Florette,'' which won the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>'s prize for best picture, and `` Manon of the Spring.'' In both, he portrays a farming village patriarch, <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Soubeyran </PERSON>. `` The reason I did n't want to make the movies was not because I look 20 years older,'' said the 66-year-old <PERSON> Montand </PERSON>. `` I said, ` Let the years do their job.' It was because I wanted to go on tour.'' <PERSON> Montand </PERSON> started as a singer, was discovered by the legendary <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Piaf </PERSON>, made his first movie with her in 1945 and sang on stage and made movies until 1968 when he decided to concentrate on film acting. In 1982, he made a world singing tour which was a smash success, and planned to repeat in 1984 but made the two movies instead. `` I think it is a very good story, based on a wonderful book -LRB- <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagnol </PERSON>'s ` L'Eau des Colines' -RRB-. But it was courageous to make this kind of part, contrary to what people wait for from you. He is a nasty man. He could be very cruel in some ways,'' he said. <PERSON> Montand </PERSON> and actress <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> Signoret </PERSON>, who were married from 1950 until her death in 1985, used to read each other's movie scripts. `` Sometimes she would say, ` You're going to shoot this thing? It is awful.' I would say, ` You're right but I promised this young director.' Of course the movie is a flop,'' he recalled. `` Sometimes you fall in love with a story you're reading. If a director has good taste, he puts you in his pocket.'' <PERSON> Montand </PERSON> has advice about getting older: `` Humor, tenderness and lucidity can not change and are important in life as you become older. You need to laugh, have a sense of humor, first of all against yourself. Everybody needs tenderness. Tenderness can not become old. Never. And if you are clear _ this is right, this is not right _ you stay a young man or woman. `` I'm going to look a little pompous now but I say, never, never stop working with your memory. You remember a girl. What is her name? You say it is n't important, forget it. No, no. Make the effort to discover again the name of this girl, even if it is not important. This is exercise, like for the muscles.'' For physical exercise, <PERSON> Montand </PERSON> walks four or five miles every day when he can. `` Sometimes I make a seven or 10-minute dance in the morning. Then I take a shower and that's it.'' At the tribute, French filmmaker <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Malle </PERSON> called <PERSON> Montand </PERSON> `` one of the most romantic figures the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> cinema has ever known.'' <PERSON> Montand </PERSON>, however, still has n't figured out romance. `` I remembered this morning, lying in bed, the first time a girl kissed me or I kissed her. I did n't like it. Two months later, someone else comes, you collapse. Both are very nice looking. It's very peculiar. `` When you are an adult, it is a mystery. You love me. I love you. It's the only thing you can say. You are mad. It's unbelievable It's a volcano inside. What does it mean? We can understand nothing. Death, love, we do n't know anything about. Maybe it's better, I do n't know. It's a wonderful mystery anyway, thank God.'' During the interview in <PERSON> Montand </PERSON>'s suite in Hotel Maxim's, the telephone rang several times and a <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> representative spoke to women who wished to stop by. `` I'm sure it is only for autographs,'' the actor said with a charming smile. Since `` <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Florette </PERSON>'' and `` Manon of the Spring,'' <PERSON> Montand </PERSON> has done a few TV appearances. He plans a TV version about <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfus </PERSON>, the French army officer who was convicted for treason but later found to be the victim of anti-Semitism. He also plans to do a movie about terrorists. <PERSON> Montand </PERSON>'s next movie, though, will be a musical, `` Three Seats for the 26th,'' directed by <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Demy </PERSON> with music by <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Legrand </PERSON>, who collaborated on `` The Umbrellas of <LOCATION> Cherbourg </LOCATION>.'' `` I do n't want to tell you the story; I want it to be a surprise,'' he said. `` It will not be a beautiful masterpiece as made by <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> or <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON>.''

 A year after a military coup ended democratic government in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> nation is still reeling in the aftermath of a conflict that arose over Fijian fears of domination by the Indian population. The economy is shaky, and skilled professionals and civil servants, mostly Indians, are leaving for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> at a rate of 500 a month, double the precoup figure. Sugar production, the country's major cash crop is down 20.3 percent; tourism has dropped 26.9 percent, the currency has been devalued 33 percent, inflation has tripled to 6 percent, unemployment has reached 7.5 percent and the gross domestic product is down 11 percent. The coup of May 14, 1987, was led by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Sitiveni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> who claimed that a newly elected coalition government dominated by the decendants of immigrants from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> threatened the future of ethnic Fijians. The Indians outnumbered Fijians 348,704 to 329,305 at the time and controlled trade and commerce. The election of an Indian-controlled government led to the army coup. Prime Minister <PERSON> Timoci </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON>, a Fijian, and his Cabinet were arrested. The Constitution was suspended and rule by decree was put in force. Since then ethnic Fijian fears of Indian political supremacy have eased. But the coup virtually ended organized political activities, but the country is now seeing factional and clan rivalries among Fijian chiefs in a feud over a Fijian king. It was to solve just such rivalries that King <PERSON> Seru </PERSON> <PERSON> Cakobau </PERSON> handed over the islands, then known as the <ORGANIZATION> Cannibal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isles </ORGANIZATION>, to <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1874, after first having tried to interest the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Ratu Sir <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Cakobau </PERSON>, grndson of the king and a former prime minister, now claims the royal title, which had been vacant since the British took control. But other chiefs and clans are disputing <PERSON> Cakobau </PERSON>'s claim to the title. <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON>, the ousted prime minister, said he feared squabbling among the chiefs could provoke a violent reaction from Fijians feeling the effects of the economic downturn since the coup. Watching the tribal feuds with interest is the 39-year-old <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>, who is a commoner. He has become a cult figure to many ethnic Fijians who regard him as the savior of their culture. He is the minister for home affairs in the interim government he appointed to run the country until a new constitution is drafted and elections held. A new book, `` Rabuka _ No Other Way,'' giving <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>'s account of the coup, became an instant best seller. Also in demand is an autographed color poster of <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> in an army T-shirt and bearing the slogan, `` <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>. In God's Hands.'' A documentary film titled `` Operation Surprise,'' the code name for the coup, has been showing to packed houses. <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> has has no television. One of the first acts by <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>, a Methodist lay preacher, former rugby star and veteran of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace force was to make the religious observance of Sundays compulsory. No shops are allowed to open, no sports can be played, public transport halts and the populace is expected, but not yet compelled, to go to church. But the Sunday observance law has become so unpopular that even the <ORGANIZATION> Fiji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> has called for its repeal. In the best-selling book, written by a Fijian and an Australian, <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> says the majority of <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>'s Indians are heathens and should be converted to Christianity. Most of the Indians are Hindus. `` I do n't think they will resent it,'' <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> is quoted as saying, `` because all we are trying to do is the same thing that missionaries did here in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> when we were cannibals and heathens.'' In the year since the coup, Indian leaders have fled or taken a low profile. But one Indian who remains prominent is <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON>, 56, <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>'s minister for Indian affairs. She said in an interview the Indian community is now without a political leader, but added she saw little likelihood of communal violence between Fijians and Indians,. She expressed the view that while some Indians have left, the majority will remain and probably accept their loss of political rights. `` If Fijians want dominance and they are happy with it, perhaps that's not high a price for Indians to pay,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>'s relations with traditonal friends and neighbors are taking time to mend. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> condemned <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>'s coup. They called their ambassadors home and suspended aid, but the envoys of all three have since returned. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> have resumed non-military aid, but relations remain chilly.

 A scientist is planning to use Nazi studies of concentration camp prisoners deliberately frozen to death to further his research about hypothermia. But some scientists and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> leaders have sharply criticized his intention to use data obtained during the Holocaust. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozos </PERSON>, director of the hypothermia research laboratory at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, says he plans to analyze and republish `` The Treatment of Shock from Prolonged Exposure to Cold,'' a study by doctors at <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION>. It includes observation and physiological measurements of people placed in vats of freezing liquid, often to the point of death, according to those familiar with the study. `` We should under no circumstances use the information. It was gained in an immoral way,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hastings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a medical ethics think tank in <LOCATION> Briarcliff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` I think it goes to legitimizing the evil done. I think the findings are tainted by the horror and misery,'' said <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON>, national director of the <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Defamation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Because mammals differ widely in their physiological response to cold, hypothermia research is uniquely dependent on human test subjects, says <PERSON> Pozos </PERSON>, a specialist in the field for 12 years. `` It could advance my work in that it takes human subjects farther than we're willing,'' he said. Several medical ethicists contend study of the Nazi research could save lives and, if published with a condemnation of the methods, call attention to the plight of the Jews, Poles and Gypsies killed in the experiments. Because the Egyptians used slave labor, `` does that mean we should never gaze at the pyramids?'' asked Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biomedical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> at </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` It sends a chill down every normal human being's spine to think of the horrible things the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> did there, but I'm separating the results and the circumstances,'' said <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuroff </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> representative to the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> `` Actually, if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> doctor dedicated his study to the memory of those victims of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, it would serve as a nice way of reminding people about the horrible experiments.'' Use of Nazi science by post-World War II researchers is rare but not unprecedented. After facing a similar quandary this year, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> deleted references to Nazi research in its own draft report on a toxic gas. <PERSON> Pozos </PERSON>, 45, says he decided to use the Nazi hypothermia data after seeing a resurgence of public and scientific curiosity about it. He says copies of a 1945 English translation of the <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION> study have been available in about a dozen libraries around the country. Motivated in part by the loss of pilots in the frigid <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, the Germans used 100 to 300 prisoners to test the body's response to extreme cold, <PERSON> Pozos </PERSON> said; how many died is unclear. Besides testing the phenomenon of freezing, the doctors experimented with warming techniques ranging from body-to-body contact to alcohol ingestion, <PERSON> Pozos </PERSON> said. Word of Pozos' plans for the old Nazi experiments spread after he contacted <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> medical ethicist <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> for advice. <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> wrote a newspaper column about the issue. <PERSON> Pozos </PERSON> said he has had a generally positive response, including calls from about a half-dozen Holocaust survivors. `` They said I should get something out of this so these people would not have died in vain,'' said <PERSON> Pozos </PERSON>. Within two months, <PERSON> Pozos </PERSON> said, he hopes to republish the German study in a scientific journal with his own analysis of its quality and application to modern hypothermia research. While calling the study `` a record of unimaginable horror and cruelty,'' <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said he believes <PERSON> Pozos </PERSON> should be allowed to republish it under strict guidelines. Among other stipulations, <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> urges omission of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> doctors' names to ensure no credit is conferred. `` If the data can prevent a single death, then it is worth tolerating the stench of past deaths that will cling to each page,'' <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> has organized an international symposium on <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> science, tentatively scheduled for May 1989 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday ratified a contract giving 66,000 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees in 15 states greater job protection, the union said. The two-year contract was approved by about 54 percent of those voting, according to union officials who spoke on condition they not be identified. Two former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> locals in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> also voted Wednesday, approving separate pacts reached during the national contract talks at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s Highland Park headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> bought AMC in August. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and the No. 3 automaker reached the agreement May 4 after 2 -LCB- weeks of early negotiations aimed at mending a series of conflicts. Talks normally would have begun in July or August. The contract, which replaces a three-year agreement that would have have expired Sept. 14, mirrors that signed last fall at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The Big Three contract prevents layoffs except when production is cut because of slow sales, forbids plant closings not announced before talks began and makes it harder for companies to transfer work to outside companies or foreign countries. The Chrysler contract also provides 3 percent lump-sum bonuses in 1989 and 1990, a $ 1,000 signing bonus and, for the first time, profit-sharing according to the formula that has generated thousands of dollars for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> workers. But the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> pact also prevents the company from paying cash or stock bonuses to executives in years when a profit-sharing formula included in the contract generates no payout for workers. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> was angered in the past two years when <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> workers received no profit-sharing while executives were awarded generous bonuses. Union leaders, including Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>, have said they expected the pact, approved last week by local union leaders on the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s 140-member <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> bargaining council, to be ratified by a comfortable margin. However, the contract was rejected at several large locals, including <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s Jefferson Avenue assembly plant and Mound Road engine plant and a stamping plant in <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, union officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s 3,500-worker Warren Truck plant approved the contract with 65 percent in favor, said Local 140 President <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojcik </PERSON>. `` I'm surprised. I'm flabbergasted. I thought it would pass by a wider margin,'' said <PERSON> Wojcik </PERSON>, chairman of the elected 10-member bargaining committee. Unlike the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> pacts, the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract also protects 2,200 workers at four closing <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts plants from layoff. When any of the plants are closed, workers will be paid their regular wages and placed in a job bank. If any of the four plants _ one in <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and three in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area _ are sold instead, workers can choose whether to go into the job bank and wait for a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> opening or go with the new employer.

 From <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> to <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, show business put on the <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and raised a classy, schmaltzy salute to the songwriter Wednesday on his 100th birthday. The creator of thousands of tunes was not in Carnegie Hall for the three-hour concert, but family members filled a row. The event started big and ended bigger, with the Army Chorus and soldiers from Ft.. Dix, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, filling the stage in front of a 30-piece orchestra, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts standing in the aisles and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>'s mezzo-soprano voice soaring above them in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s `` God Bless America. Then the evening's performers filed in the audience stood, and everybody sang a lusty `` There's No Business Like Show Business,'' still another <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> classic. The artists included <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> on piano. It was <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> singing debut with <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s `` Russian Lullaby. Director-choreographer <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tune </PERSON> tapdanced to `` Puttin' on the Ritz,'' and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, in formal black with a black cowboy hat, brought his band for `` Blue Skies.'' `` We would n't think of doing a show without including it,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> sang `` Always'' and `` When I Lost You,'' <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> did `` <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s Ragtime Band,'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Orbach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> `` Easter Parade,'' and <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Clooney </PERSON> `` Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep'' and `` White Christmas.'' <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> narrated a film of highlights of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s life. The evening, a benefit for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, was taped by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> for broadcast May 27. `` <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> took common American talk and made it into poetry. He gave it back to us as beautiful treasures of how we feel, not fancy, not too highbrow, simple and graceful,'' said <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>, formerly of the musical radio program `` A Prairie Home Companion.'' At midday, 14 cast members of the Broadway show, `` A Chorus Line,'' warmed up the festivities with an enthusiastic songfest at the Central Park Arsenal, a 140-year-old landmark. `` There's no business like show business!'' proclaimed the youthful Broadway talents. Their sprightly medley ranged from love songs such as `` They Say That Falling in Love is Wonderful,'' to the torch song `` What'll I Do,'' to the humorous `` You Ca n't Get a Man With a Gun.'' In the latter, from the 1946 musical `` Annie Get Your Gun,'' the hungry-for-love sharpshooter laments, `` You ca n't shoot a man in the tail like a quail.'' After rallying around a grand piano played by `` Chorus Line'' conductor <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, the cast members moved outside to offer an a cappella chorus of `` God Bless America'' and `` Happy Birthday,'' then cut loose green helium balloons. People from all walks of life got into the act around the city _ and the nation. On <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 15 handicapped Boy Scouts sang `` Happy Birthday'' and `` God Bless America'' during the dedication of a new log cabin named for <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. He had donated the residuals from the patriotic tune to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. Patients in 100 Veterans Administration hospitals and nursing homes around the nation geared up to sing `` God Bless America'' simultaneously, at 5 p.m. Eastern time. The composer, meanwhile, was spending the day `` quietly at home'' and did not plan to be at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s secretary, <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> `` He's never made a big thing about his birthdays,'' she said. `` Let's face it, he's not 22 years old.'' That did n't discourage the 75 New Yorkers who gathered outside <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> home to usher in his special day with a midnight serenade. `` Even if he did n't write a thing, to reach 100 is to be part of American history,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiessman </PERSON>, 21, a junior at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` But this guy wrote a lot. I love ` God Bless America.' Every American has got to love it.'' The reclusive <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, who lives on exclusive Beekman Place with his second wife, <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON>, did not appear at his window when <PERSON> Wiessman </PERSON> and the others crooned `` We'll be loving you, always.'' But he knew they were there. `` When they were there singing, of course he heard them. He was very thrilled by that,'' said his secretary.

 A top <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> official conceded Wednesday that two whistleblowers from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state may have been harassed by their superiors after testifying last year before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee about safety problems at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation. Under Secretary of Energy <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON>, who has responsibility for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s safety programs at facilities such as the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> reservation, said that both he and the department had `` failed'' to protect <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Simkin </PERSON> from any retaliation by their employer. `` It was negligent on my part,'' <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> told the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said the handling of <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simpkin </PERSON> `` called into question'' the department's efforts to improve its safety programs and that the two should have been praised rather than harassed. `` We failed to acknowledge what they had done,'' said <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON>. `` It was the wrong thing to do.'' <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> had `` sent the wrong message'' to employees who are concerned about safety at federal nuclear facilities. During an October hearing before the same subcommittee, <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simkin </PERSON> had outlined a series of safety problems at the central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> nuclear facility and <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> had pledged they they would not suffer because of their testimony. <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simpkin </PERSON> said Wednesday they had been `` harassed and intimidated'' since their last appearance before the subcommittee and that other workers at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> reservation are afraid to report safety problems for fear of reprisals. <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON>, laid off in February by the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he was told by his superiors there was an `` unwritten understanding'' that he would never be promoted. In addition, <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> said one supervisor, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who now heads one of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>'s employee concerns committee, told him if his testimony before the subcommittee prevented him from getting anotherjob `` that's just too bad.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanford </ORGANIZATION>, admitted that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> heads the employee concerns committee, but said he was not aware of <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON>'s allegation prior to Wednesday and promised to investigate <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON>'s claims. There are `` many other people -LRB- at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> -RRB- who are afraid to come forward with serious problems because they fear reprisals,'' <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Simpkin </PERSON> still works at the Hanford reservation, but said he has been transferred to a department where he can not `` contribute ... to correcting the safety problems at Hanford.'' Less than a month after last fall's hearing, <PERSON> Simpkin </PERSON> said he received a letter of reprimand from his supervisor. The letter was withdrawn after an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation found it was `` unfair and unjustified.'' Some Republican members of the committee suggested that perhaps <PERSON> Simpkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> were not qualified for the transfers they had sought. Others suggested the two had n't been singled out but had been caught up in the massive layoffs and employee reshuffling resulting from the closing of the reactor and the decision not to locate the nation's first high-level nuclear waste dump at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>. `` No congressional committee can function if witnesses have apprehensions about what will happen if they tell the truth,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingel </PERSON>, D-Mich., subcomittee chairman `` The matter will not end with this meeting today.'' But `` the function of this hearing was not to demean you or your department,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> told <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> technician accused of having sex with his fiancee without telling her he was infected with the AIDS virus was acquitted of assault Wednesday by a military jury. Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Magnolia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, stood at attention in the packed courtroom as the seven-member jury delivered the verdict after 4 -LCB- hours of deliberation. The sailor was convicted of a minor charge of having a visitor in his room after hours and was given 15 days in the brig and reduced in rank one grade. He could have received up to two years in the brig for the offense. `` It was what I felt was right,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, accompanied by his present fiancee, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Skavdahl </PERSON>, said of the verdict. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> could have been stripped of his rank, dishonorably discharged and sentenced to a decade behind bars had he been convicted of assault. The jury also acquitted him of adultery and of exposing his former fiancee, <PERSON> Jeannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>, to the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> is a civilian. The case was unprecedented in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, although there have been similar cases in other branches of the military. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> was accused of having unprotected sex with <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> in 1987 without warning her he had tested positive for the AIDS virus. He was charged with adultery because <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> was separated, but not divorced, from her third husband. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, an avionics technician, testified he told <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> about his test results and wore a condom when the couple made love in his barracks room. But <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> said that she did n't learn <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> had been exposed to the virus until the next day, when her housemate _ who also had been <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s lover _ told her about the sailor's test. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> has tested negative for the AIDS virus. Five of the seven members of the jury had to agree to reach verdicts. `` The government is attempting to explore how far the Uniform Code of Military Justice can be applied against an individual ... with the AIDS virus,'' defense attorney Lt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> charged as the case went to the jury. `` The government seeks to hold out Petty Officer <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> as a guinea pig to see how far it can go on the AIDS issue.'' Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliland </PERSON>, prosecutor in the case, said in her closing statement that <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, depicted as caring and concerned by the defense, simply did n't care enough about <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> to tell her about the tests. `` She had no idea that the act of sex which she engaged in with Petty Officer <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> was potentially fatal to her,'' <PERSON> Gilliland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> was bitter that he had broken off their brief engagement and filed charges for revenge. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, the AIDS-related court-martial of <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> resumed for the hearing of motions after a nine-month delay. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a 28-year-old Army private from <LOCATION> Caseyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, is accused of having threatened the health of three soldiers by not using condoms during sex and failing to warn them he had tested positive for the AIDS virus. Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> set a July trial date after denying motions for dismissal of charges. Cole will hear the case without a jury at <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' request. He is charged with aggravated assault, conduct prejudicial to the good order and discipline of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and sodomy. The proceedings were adjourned Aug. 5 by Cole to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to appeal his ruling barring the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from introducing <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' AIDS blood test as evidence. Cole's ruling was later reversed. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 20 percent to 30 percent of those who show antibodies to the AIDS virus will develop the fatal disease within five years.

 More than 100 descendants of colonial planter <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON> are expected at his plantation this weekend to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the family homestead. <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a two-story brick Georgian structure northwest of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, has passed through seven generations of the <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON> family. Now it is one of 13 sites maintained by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> that is open to the public. It attracts more than 52,000 visitors a year. The <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON> family settled in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in 1679 _ nine years after the founding of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. The youngest son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, began construction of <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> in 1738. It was completed four years later. His father lived at nearby <LOCATION> Magnolia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plantation </LOCATION>, which also is a popular tourist attraction. There are an estimated 4,000 descendants of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON> scattered around the world, and at least 100 are expected for the celebration, which will include dancing under the stars and workshops on archaeology, said <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON>, curator at <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> is the only <LOCATION> Ashley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plantation to survive the Civil War intact. Two small flanking buildings _ one used as a kitchen and one as a utility building _ were destroyed in the 1886 <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> earthquake and a hurricane seven years later. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>, assistant director of <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, said that according to family legend, the house emerged from the Civil War unscathed because of the quick thinking of its occupant, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON>. As Union troops marched through toward the end of the war, <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON> had the house posted with flags signifying it was being used to treat smallpox patients. However, it's not known whether it actually was used as a hospital. `` The story comes down both through the owners and slave descendants. Whether it was a ruse or not is unclear,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON>. The builder of the house was a successful planter who owned up to 125 slaves and acquired 30 other properties including townhouses in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. The cost of building the manor, located on a 125-acre tract, is not known, said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>. However, in the later part of the 18th Century the house was referred to as `` Mr. <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON>'s Palace.''

 They do n't look much like <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, but hefty <PERSON> Sharlyne </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> are making a splash in the exercise video market with a tape for large women. The former housewives, who founded the Yakima-based Women At Large exercise studios, star in a slick new video designed for people whose bodies have more curves than angles. `` It's been on the market almost a month and we've sold 11,000 copies,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said Tuesday. The $ 160,000 production was financed by the women and television host <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> <PERSON> Weller </PERSON>, of `` Entertainment Tonight'' and the `` Home'' show. They are splitting the profits 50-50. <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION> Weller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, met Mrs. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> when they appeared on the pilot for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Home'' show several months ago. `` They were terrific people and they wanted to do some other projects with us,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. The video, which sells for $ 29.95, is just the latest success for Women At Large, a chain of exercise studios founded by two, self-described bored housewives in 1983. The clubs cater to the 30 million women in the nation who wear clothes size 16 or above. Instructors average 175 pounds, and the goal is to build fitness and self-esteem, not lose pounds. In their determination that pounds do not matter, both women refuse to disclose their ample weight. Women At Large has sold 24 franchises around the country since 1986 and is negotiating with franchises in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` I'm ready to really bust out with it now,'' she said. `` I have all the systems in place.'' The two have become media darlings in the last year. They filmed a segment of the `` Today'' show on Wednesday morning, then were scheduled to depart for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Monday for national and local television and newspaper interviews. Shortly after, they depart for a cross-country tour to promote the exercise tape. `` I'm flying around so much I have little time to exercise any more,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` I've got to make a concerted effort to get back on the regimen.'' The tape features the women's program of low-impact aerobics that does not include the running, jumping and jogging they feel can damage a heavier body.

 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> took time off from discussing his book on the inner workings of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that financial markets and the government must act quickly to reassure the nation's investors. The former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary said Wednesday that `` there should have been more prompt action'' after last October's stock market crash. `` This thing happened over seven months ago,'' he said. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that a form of computerized trading called index arbitrage should be prohibited, and that all transactions involving stock index futures should be temporarily halted. Both practices, he said, make the markets excessively volatile and have scared worried individual investors off. `` A stock market whose main participants are speculators and their programs can not be a healthy market, and an unhealthy Wall Street will sooner or later drag down the real economy,'' said <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, the former chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The banking panel has been holding hearings on the dramatic price swings that have dominated the markets since Oct. 19, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a record 508 points. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who was White House chief of staff for two years after being treasury secretary, has spent most of his time recently talking about his new book, `` For the Record: From Wall Street to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' In it, he says first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> often consults astrologers when planning the president's schedule and making other decisions. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> declined to discuss his book Wednesday with reporters. But he did blame computer-driven trading, especially index arbitrage, for the market's problems. Traders conducting index arbitrage use computers to profit from price discrepancies between the stock and futures markets by simultaneously buying in one market and selling in the other. `` In my mind, we should start by banning index option arbitrage, and then proceed with other reforms which will restore public confidence in the financial markets,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. He said problems also have been caused by stock futures, which are traded in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In a stock index futures transaction, an amount of cash equal to the value of a collection of stocks changes hands, with an agreement that the portfolio will be bought back at whatever those stocks' values are at a specific future date. Opponents of the practice say the massive amounts of money involved add unpredictability to the stock market when traders buy or sell equities to protect their futures transactions. `` I think there should be a pause'' in index futures trading, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> told reporters after his testimony. `` It wo n't hurt very much for a three-month or six-month pause here while we take a look at the instrument itself and how it's used to see whether or not it should be permitted to continue.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> told the senators the nation's financial markets, or the federal agencies that regulate them, should initiate the steps he recommended. If not, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should act, he said. At the same hearing, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the abolition of stock index futures should be considered. `` Most knowledgeable professionals agree that if it were not for index futures, stock market moves would be far less wild, sudden or irrationally large,'' he said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON>, who owns the discount brokerage firm that bears his name, also told the lawmakers that program trading should be abolished if other steps to restore market confidence do n't work. `` In surveys we have conducted, we hear over and over again the theme that individual investors fear they can not compete in markets that are so dominated by the volatility introduced by program trading and index arbitrage,'' he said. Earlier, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the executive committee of the board of governors of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that index arbitrage helps stabilize the markets by ensuring that stock and futures prices closely track each other. `` I'm not going to defend perception,'' he said. `` The reality is it is not a factor'' in the volatility.

Plant-Closing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 There's a creaky plank in the platform President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stands on when he sounds off against legislation aimed at protecting workers against sudden plant closings. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, speaking against the provision recently, said that `` as an old labor union president, I suggest that's a matter that belongs in the management-labor contracts between the unions and the people.'' But that suggests organized labor plays a larger-than-life role in today's economy. Many government statisticians, unionists and even business executives know better. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> headed the Screen Actors Guild in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in the late 1940s, when unions were far more powerful than they are today, representing roughly a third of all workers. Because unions now represent only about 15 percent of all workers, and about 20 percent in manufacturing, it does n't necessarily follow that plant notification protections can be left for employers and unions to settle Doing that would leave open the question of who takes care of the interests of the other 80 percent of blue-collar workers. What's happened is that the administration has essentially accepted the boardroom argument that executives must be free to make their own decisions, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s shopworn argument notwithstanding. And Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> conceded to a manfacturer's audience Tuesday that this may prove politically costly, especially if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s expected veto of the bill is sustained `` The polls have indicated that, from the people I've talked to, 62 percent of the people think that plant notification is the right way to go,'' she said. `` This issue is going to drive us kicking and screaming for the next five months.'' The plant-closing provision in the 1,000-page trade bill was the product of heavy lobbying by the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, and many Democrats were unwilling to see it pulled from the bill. `` The workers who do not have the benefit of a union are treated like dogs,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, assistant to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fact is that, although a lot of companies talk a good game and a lot of them do a good game, the overwhelming fact is that many workers do not get sufficient notice,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. He cited a <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study which found that workers hit by plant closings but not represented by unions had an average of only two days warning. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON>, special counsel for domestic policy at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is correct in opposing any move by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to legislate worker notification protections. `` Eighty-eight percent of the employers do give some notice and more and more employers are giving more, whether they have unions or not,'' he said. `` But it's not always possible for businesses in financial turmoil.'' Plant closing legislation, he said, `` would handcuff employers at a time which is particularly troubled and turbulent.'' <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, a labor economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a business research organization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, challenged arguments used by government, business and labor on this issue. Referring to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement about leaving plant-closing protection to companies and unions, she said, `` I think that's a cynical response that you're getting from the White House.'' `` The strength of unions tends to be more and more in government and government-affected employment,'' rather than in manufacturing, she said. `` The whole plant-closing thing is kind of artificial,'' she said. `` I have the impression that they're -LRB- the opponents and proponents -RRB- just acting in front of a painted scenery.'' Ms. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said she thinks business overstates its concern about governmental interference and that organized labor merely is trying to get back a greater say in the decision-making process.

 Lawmakers who like to boast about how they brought their district a new dam, deeper harbor or irrigation system will find no cause to brag in a spending bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The committee on Wednesday approved its first fiscal 1989 spending bill _ a $ 17.8 billion proposal for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION>. And for the first time in the memory of panel members and veteran staffers, there's no money for the corps or the bureau to begin construction of any new water projects in fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. `` You ca n't have just one new construction start,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, D-Ala., chairman of the Appropriations energy and water development subcommittee `` If we do one, we have to do all the requests.'' <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON> said the unusual austerity was necessitated by last year's budget summit at which the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and congressional leaders agreed on a two-year blueprint designed to cut mounting federal deficits. `` This has been the most difficult appropriations bill we've ever put together,'' <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON> said as the full committee approved the spending bill, the first of 13 it will handle this year Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the no-new-starts decree could spell an end to an old <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> juggling act: satisfy as many member project requests as possible by putting up enough money to get the shovel in the ground, with the big bucks coming in later years `` Those days are over,'' <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> said. `` Maybe the `` T'' word _ taxes _ needs to be mentioned.

He said that because these total about $ 8.1 billion, there was little discretionary money for new projects after financing other activities like continued work on some 400 water projects already under construction and paying for operation and maintenance of hundreds more. `` There just is n't a dollar left,'' added Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>'s subcommittee. `` This is by far the toughest year we've had.''

<HEAD>Federal Study Shows Viet Vets Have More Depression, Alcohol Abuse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 American soldiers who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> suffer from more depression, anxiety and alcohol abuse than do other GIs, but medical examinations reveal no physical indications of exposure to Agent Orange, a herbicide used widely during the Vietnam War. Those are among the findings of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Experience Study, a federal report prepared for release today at a hearing before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. The study, conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> and released for publication in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also showed that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans have a greater hearing loss and a measurably lower sperm count. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> based its findings on telephone interviews with 7,924 GIs who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and 7,364 veterans who served elsewhere. Those interviewed were selected randomly from enlisted men who entered the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from 1965 to 1971. A subsample of 2,490 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and 1,972 other soldiers also underwent extensive physical examinations as part of the study. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans were almost twice as likely -LRB- 19.6 percent to 11.1 percent -RRB- to report that they had health problems. Yet, when physicians who did not know the military history of the two groups examined the former soldiers, they could detect few medical differences between the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and the others. The study said the difference between what the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans reported and what was found in examination may be the result of increased stress. `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans may have reported more symptoms and past medical conditions because they experienced more stress than did non-Vietnam veterans,'' said the study. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans also showed more anxiety and depression in a battery of psychological tests. `` Stress can produce anxiety, depression and a variety of somatic -LRB- physical -RRB- symptoms,'' the study said. The <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans are more likely to experience psychological problems, the study said. About 14 percent of the Viet vets are abusing alcohol, compared to 9 percent of the other group. For anxiety, the difference is 5 percent to 3 percent, and for depression, the difference is 5 percent to 2 percent. Drug use was about the same between the groups, but the study said data suggest that more <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans suffered drug-related deaths. Fifteen percent of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans also suffered some symptoms of combat-related post traumatic stress disorder, and 2 percent reported such symptoms the month of the interviews. The study also said that the `` perceived exposure to herbicides -LRB- a perception that in itself may lead to additional stress -RRB- is associated both with psychological problems and with self-reported adverse health conditions, but is not associated with objective measures of exposure.'' Many in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Veterans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> organization have blamed health problems on exposure during the war in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to Agent Orange, a herbicide used to thin vegetation in dense jungle combat areas. Use of Agent Orange was discontinued after it was determined that it contained dioxin, a potent cancer-causing chemical. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> study, however, said it found no difference in the rate of cancers between the two groups of soldiers. Soldiers who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, particularly those in combat, suffered more hearing loss than those who served elsewhere, the study said. `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans were 40 percent more likely to have high-frequency hearing loss'' than GIs not in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the study said. It added that this `` is consistent with results of several studies of army troops that show that exposure to military noise results in irreversible hearing impairment.'' A study of semen samples taken from 571 members of the two groups showed that the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran is twice as likely to have a low sperm concentration and 1.5 times as likely to have low levels of normal sperm cells. And, yet, the study said, the two groups fathered about the same number of children _ 1.4 each for the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets, and 1.5 for the non-Vietnam soldiers _ and reported about the same rate of birth defects in their children. `` We were not able to determine the reasons for the differences in sperm characteristics between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and non-Vietnam veterans,'' the report said. The Vietnam Experience Study was ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as part of a veterans benefit bills passed in 1979 and 1981.

<TEXT>
 They're all old men now, but the soldiers of the multinational `` Jedburgh'' unit today are remembering the days in World War II when they parachuted behind enemy lines with a radio and a small fortune. `` We're getting a bit thinner every year,'' said <PERSON> Ivor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Haverhill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, after some of the old soldiers chanted a raunchy put-down of superior officers in the <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> waiting area on Wednesday. The American and British veterans welcomed their French comrades, along with widows and family members of some who have died. In what is billed as probably their last full reunion, the 51 American, 26 French and 18 British `` Jeds'' _ some have not seen each other for 44 years _ were beginning activities today that would include wreath-laying ceremonies at <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>, honors at the British and French embassies and a visit with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday. Some are bragging a little. Others speak softly of lost comrades in one of the most heroic and secretive exploits of the war. The `` top secret'' classification for hundreds of boxes of government documents on the unit was only lifted in 1985. In teams of three, 279 Jeds were dropped across <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, to help lead the resistance against German occupation. Their name comes from a town in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> where `` Jedburgh justice'' for sheep rustlers meant `` hang them first and question them afterwards.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazata </PERSON>, who said he is still involved in government work and accepts the description `` red-headed soldier of fortune'' even though his hair is now pure white, asked another <PERSON> Jed </PERSON> at the airport if he'd ever lost any of the money they were given to aid the resistance around the time of the June 6, 1944, <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> landings. <PERSON> Bazata </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said he parachuted in with $ 300,000 in cash. `` I loved it. You were totally your own boss, responsible for everything. When you sent messages back to headquarters, they listened. And you had unlimited money,'' said <PERSON> Bazata </PERSON>. The Jeds sabotaged German troops, blew up bridges and helped organize and arm resistance forces. Most spoke French and blended into cities and villages taken over by the Germans. Some of the Americans went on to similar missions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, organizing popular resistance against Japanese forces. Because they could pick their targets, few were killed during the mission, said retired Col. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who is writing a book about Allied efforts behind enemy lines. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> worked in the Jedburgh operation and supervised some of the forces in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but was not a <PERSON> Jed </PERSON> himself. `` They were guerrillas. They had to design operations that would keep them alive,'' he said. <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON> <PERSON> Friele </PERSON>, who has helped organize the reunion, was so taken by the American <PERSON> Jeds </PERSON> when she was an 18-year-old secretary to their <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> commander that she later married two of them. Her first husband, Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mundinger </PERSON>, died in the Korean War. Two years ago, she married <PERSON> Berent </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friele </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, after they met again at a Jed reunion in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` It took some of them this long to find each other, and they wo n't let go,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Friele </PERSON>, 62, who is still trying to find out what happened to the only two Americans in the unit she has n't accounted for: <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> American members include former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>; retired Army Maj.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says serious health problems among workers required to do repetitive physical labor on assembly lines prompted the agency's second-largest fine ever against a single company. <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> is trying to impose `` Alice in Wonderland theories'' on industry, but the union representing workers at <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, meatpacking plant hailed Wednesday's decision to get tough with the company <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said it was imposing a $ 3.1 million fine against <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> for willfully ignoring the hazards of repetitive motion. The agency maintains that <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> could have taken numerous steps to reduce the risk of injury, but did not. The affected employees work on production lines, doing such work as cutting, trimming, hide removal and lifting meat with hooks, said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON>. All the work is done while the meat moves at high speed through work stations in a cold, damp environment. <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> said safety inspectors from the agency first `` noticed a pattern of repetitive motion injuries'' during a preliminary review of safety records in November 1987. Such injuries can be crippling and are caused by repeated hand, wrist and arm motion. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> Deputy Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said repetitive motion injuries are `` a major health hazard in one of the most dangerous occupations in the country, and we want the meatpacking industry, in general, and <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION>, in particular, to eliminate the problem.'' <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> refused to slow its production lines, change equipment designs or educate workers about the need to change positions periodically. `` IBP has known about the high toll that these disorders have had on its work force but has chosen not to deal with it,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` We're most pleased about the recommendations the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> made in their lengthy complaint against <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> _ recommendations for some very simple ways of preventing injuries,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has 15 working days to contest the fine. The company already is contesting a $ 2.6 million fine levied by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> last July for safety and record violations at the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> plant. In a statement issued late Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> officials indicated they will fight the case in court. The citation, the company statement said, `` represents a misguided attempt by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> to force the meatpacking industry to blindly accept untested theories about the prevention of repetitive motion disorders.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s goal,'' the statement continued, `` is to intimidate companies by threatening enormous penalties unless they accept <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> in Wonderland theories.'' The company said it has urged <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> to develop a special program for the meatpacking industry, but that <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has not done that. <PERSON> Zack </PERSON> said the union is disappointed that <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> continues to `` deny there is a problem. It would be far preferable if <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> would start working on solutions.'' After the preliminary study revelaed a pattern of injuries, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> hired an expert in ergonomics, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, to do more extensive studies, <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> said. The studies found that 620 workers at 45 work stations at the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> plant were `` at grave risk'' of developing repetitive motion illnesses, he said. Of those, 377 workers actually had developed injuries, <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> said. Some required surgery, some are on restricted work schedules and some are on permanent disability leave, he said. The $ 3.1 million fine represents a $ 5,000 penalty for each of the 620 workers. <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> estimated that a total of 3,000 people work at the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> plant, one of 15 IBP plants. Workers at the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> plant went on strike in the winter of 1987, following a bitter lockout by <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION>. The strike ended last July. The fine is the second largest <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has ever imposed against an individual company. The largest was $ 4.2 million against Bath Iron Works in Bath, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, in November 1987 for health and safety violations. The largest fine against multiple companies came in March of this year _ $ 5.11 million against five contractors that worked on a <LOCATION> Brideport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, apartment building that collapsed in April 1987.

 The governors of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> will join forces aboard a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> barge Friday for a fight against the Delta region's depressed economy.

The governors will sign two agreements. One will seek support for a congressional bill requesting federal assistance for the region. `` We are going to try to present a united front to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. He said the states could share administration of some programs to help the area and he cited as an example the possibility of schools in which children and their parents could be taught. `` I can see a mother bringing her child to a first-grade class to read and write and go down to a hallway where she would learn to read and write,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. The other agreement involves coordination of international trade efforts and attempts to attract foreign investment, with the first target country being <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said the region has been devastated by national farm problems that had dried up markets for Delta-grown soybeans, rice, milo and cotton. Industries that once offered jobs to displaced farmhands have moved overseas in quest of cheaper labor. Statistics show the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> counties and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> parishes in the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> region _ the flatlands on both sides of the river from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION> _ are among the nation's poorest, many with poverty levels of above 50 percent Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., a sponsor of legislation to authorize federal aid, said the Delta should be the target of an anti-poverty crusade similar to President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s effort to improve conditions in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, D-Ark., said he hoped a federal study would produce a report `` that will almost shame <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> into taking action.

 Teams of elected officials from a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> group plan to campaign in coming months for a voluntary program that would link federal education, housing and job training aid to participation in civilian or military service. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., said the plan proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> would say essentially `` that if you're going to get assistance from society for your education, then you're going to serve society. The group released its 66-page proposal on Wednesday. It calls for creation of a `` Citizens Corps'' made up of young volunteers who would work one or two years at subsistence wages in civilian or military service. For each year of service in the corps a volunteers would earn a $ 10,000 voucher that could be used for college, vocational training or a home down payment. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said the vouchers would eventually replace existing federal grant and loan programs as the primary source of federal aid to students. The proposal also calls for enlistment of volunteers over the age of 65, who would earn modest wages instead of vouchers and would perform primarily administrative and supervisory tasks within the corps. Former <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, past chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> DLC </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposal is `` an attempt to move away from the politics of pure entitlement to some sort of system that involves mutual civic obligation.''

 Doctors often fail to recognize serious side effects of psychiatric drugs, leaving patients with unnecessary anxiety and lethargy and at risk of giving up the medication, according to a study. `` The side effects are being missed in epidemic proportions,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiden </PERSON>, assistant professor of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. While the study dealt with hospitalized patients, the side effects are so unpleasant that they could make patients stop taking the medications once they are discharged, he said. Doctors must be better trained to spot and treat side effects, while patients and their families must be taught to recognize the problems and point them out to doctors, <PERSON> Weiden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weiden </PERSON> presented his study Wednesday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Similar findings have emerged from studies at several psychiatric hospitals, he said. `` It's cause for concern. It's a good reason for education'' of doctors, patients, families and health systems, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbott </PERSON>, chairman of the psychiatry department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and a former president of the association. The study dealt with side effects of drugs called neuroleptics, which are used to treat hospitalized patients for schizophrenia, manic-depression and severe depression. The same drugs are used in lower doses for outpatients with schizophrenia and related conditions, and some other illnesses. Serious side effects are fairly common. One recent study found them in about 62 percent of patients on the drugs. If recognized, the side effects can be treated with other medications or by reducing dosages of the neuroleptic. <PERSON> Weiden </PERSON> and colleagues looked for side effects in 48 patients admitted to a private psychiatric hospital. They then compared their assessments with those of the doctors treating the patients. They found that the doctors overlooked side effects in: _ 20 of 27 patients with akathisia, a physical or mental restlessness that can include pacing, leg motion, agitation and the urge to move or flee. _ 12 of 29 patients with parkinsonism, which includes tremor, rigidity and slowing of movements. _ two of three patients with acute dystonia, an often frightening attack of muscle contraction that can last several seconds. _ nine of 23 patients with akinesia, a decrease in spontaneous movements and gestures or a zombie-like feeling. Some unrecognized cases of akinesia were so severe that `` the patients could hardly move,'' <PERSON> Weiden </PERSON> said. In rare cases, side effects can be fatal, he said in an interview. Doctors overlook side effects for several reasons, <PERSON> Weiden </PERSON> said. They are not extensively trained in spotting side effects, some of which mimic symptoms of a patient's illness. Working in a psychiatric hospital ward, they also tend to get used to seeing the side effects, he said, and `` you kind of forget how distressing it is.'' In addition, the acutely psychotic patients often can not communicate about the problem effectively, he said. To improve diagnosis of the side effects, doctors in psychiatric wards should ask specifically about the symptoms, carefully record the patient's physical and pharmacological history, and do physical exminations apart from therapy sessions, <PERSON> Weiden </PERSON> said. Nurses and doctors should get early training in spotting the problem, he said. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said part of the discrepancy <PERSON> Weiden </PERSON>'s study found might result from different opinions on when symptoms are serious enough for a diagnosis. But he agreed that many physicians are not adequately trained on spotting side effects.

 A congresswoman is accusing a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official of harassing one of his senior attorneys who is seeking to extend her maternity leave to seven months instead of the usual three to four months. `` Has war on maternity leave replaced the war on drugs?'' Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., wrote Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> The letter was directed against Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, head of the department's criminal division. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> has ordered <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernott </PERSON> to return to work May 31 or submit additional medical information from her doctor giving a reason why her leave should be extended to mid-August. On May 4, <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> rejected Ms. <PERSON> Bernott </PERSON>'s request, which is supported by a note from her medical doctor, to extend her leave without pay to Aug. 15. Asked whether she would report to work May 31, Ms. <PERSON> Bernott </PERSON>, who went on maternity leave Jan. 25, said that she would defer to the advice of her doctor. In an interview Wednesday, <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> responded that `` there was no intent whatsoever to harass'' Ms. <PERSON> Bernott </PERSON> and that `` the idea that there is discrimination here is absolutely untrue.'' He referred to an April 21 comment in which he told Ms. <PERSON> Bernott </PERSON>'s lawyer that `` nobody is going to ask Ms. <PERSON> Bernott </PERSON> to do anything which would in any way jeopardize her health'' and said he simply wanted more information from her doctor regarding the medical basis for the additional leave time. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said the civil division faces an enormous workload and that it was vital that its 25 senior attorney positions _ one of which is held by Ms. <PERSON> Bernott </PERSON> _ be staffed fully. Ms. <PERSON> Bernott </PERSON> obtained a letter from her physician, Dr. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, on March 28 saying that an additional four months of recuperation from a difficult pregnancy was required. `` Return to work now, in my opinion, represents health risk to this patient,'' the doctor said in a follow-up April 26 letter submitted as a result of <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>'s request for more information. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Bernott </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, director of the office of administration, on March 25 that she did n't want to return to work before mid-August because she wanted to attend a wedding of her husband's brother in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the week before Aug. 15. Ms. <PERSON> Bernott </PERSON> said she did not want to come back earlier in August and then simply have to ask for another week off to go to the wedding, he said. Ms. <PERSON> Bernott </PERSON> hired a lawyer to represent her after <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> told her in a letter April 13 that there was `` evidence that you may have willfully submitted a fraudulently based claim for excessive leave.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bernott </PERSON>, 42, who has three children, was the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s lead attorney in successfully defending the government against litigation surrounding the use of the defoliant Agent Orange during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war.

 Troops foiled a rebellion against President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>'s civilian government and arrested two army officers who were halted leading soldiers toward the capital, the defense minister said. The minister, Gen. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, gave no details of Wednesday's rebellion and would not confirm an earlier <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement that a coup attempt had taken place. He did not say how many soldiers were involved, what kind of arms they used or if there was any violence. <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said the two officers arrested, whom he refused to identify by name or rank, had staged short-lived `` acts of indiscipline.'' Reading a prepared statement, he told a news conference the two ringleaders met with officers and soldiers at bases in <LOCATION> Jutiapa </LOCATION>, 75 miles south of the capital, and <LOCATION> Retalhuleu </LOCATION>, 115 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Guatememala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and led them toward the capital Wednesday morning. `` They were immediately neutralized and the officers involved immediately changed their attitude,'' <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said, adding that the rest of the army's 74 bases and installations were not involved. The defense minister said one of the ringleaders temporarily blocked the road leading from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, prompting the army to deploy extra troops around the capital. <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> remained calm throughout the day. Local radio and television broadcasts said troops involved in the uprising had returned to their barracks. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said preliminary reports indicated some military units were involved in a coup attempt, but she had no details. She reaffirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for civilian government. <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>, who with his Cabinet were briefed on the uprising by <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, did not issue any public statement. A lawyer and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> was elected in November 1985 in the first election in 16 years in which the military did not field a candidate.

He is more than 600 delegates ahead of his only remaining Democratic rival, but is still several hundred shy of the 2,081 delegates needed to nominate.

The vice president, who has a mathematical lock on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, received President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s formal endorsement on Wednesday night. That drew a gibe from the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp. `` We figured it's because <PERSON> Aquarii </PERSON> get along better with Geminis than Scorpios,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Akey </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s consultations with an astrologer, as reported by former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> in his new book. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rode high-speed trains being tested for use between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of failing to promote such service and `` spending the last eight years without a national transportation policy.''

On Wednesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made his trademark anti-drug appeal at a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> high school. `` You get those guns out of your pockets and the drugs out of your life and you can make a difference,'' he told about 1,300 students at predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` Dope pushers are killers of the dream,'' he said. `` They're terrorists. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was greeted with thunderous applause on his arrival in the school's gymnasium and received several standing ovations from the students.

 A feisty, 3-year-old girl who made medical history with a five-organ transplant died after a six-month struggle that doctors say will help advance research into the experimental surgery. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, who spent most of her life in hospitals, died Wednesday afternoon, a month shy of her fourth birthday, in the intensive care unit at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The 36-pound, pigtailed child was the world's longest survivor of a five-organ transplant. She received a new liver, small intestines, pancreas and parts of a stomach and colon during a 15-hour experimental operation that ended Nov. 1. Similar procedures had been performed only twice before in the world, and both patients died within a few days. An infection in <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s bloodstream caused her heart, kidneys and liver to fail, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>. `` It was system failure, everything. It was like a chain reaction,'' she said. Among those expressing sympathy was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who had mentioned <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s plight in a national radio address in January and contributed $ 1,000 toward her medical expenses. `` Many Americans were drawn to her because of her courageous battle against birth defects. We extend our deepest sympathies to her family,'' the president said in a statement. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, were at her side and had told doctors not to try to revive her if her heart stopped, Ms. <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said. `` I was a little surprised that it ended as suddenly as this,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, director of transplant surgery at Children's Hospital. `` Even though she was a child of enormous physical and enormous emotional strength, it was just slowly ebbing away.'' As <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> described the devotion of <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s parents at a news conference, he stopped speaking in the middle of a sentence and sat down, fighting back tears. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> won the hearts of hospital staff with good-natured teasing, playing peek-a-boo, giggling each day at `` Sesame Street'' and singing `` The Itsy-Bitsy Spider.'' `` Bless her little heart,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, a family friend in <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>. `` A lot of times you see a child who has been sick and they're kind of moody. But <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> was an outgoing girl. She was n't afraid of anything.'' Well-wishers from around the country, including <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, donated more than $ 350,000 to help cover her medical expenses. Much of the money came from black churches. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>, who was black, also received boxloads of toys, cards and notes from schoolchildren. <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said a study of <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s case in coming weeks will help determine the feasibility of future multiple-organ transplants. `` This is not the loss meaninglessly of a life,'' the surgeon said. `` Along with death came the accrual of something really worthwhile.'' <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s parents decided they did not want an autopsy performed, but <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said he hoped they would allow doctors to study some tissues from the transplanted organs. Because of an intestinal deformity, doctors had been forced to remove 95 percent of <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s small bowel three days after she was born. She was placed on a highly concentrated liquid diet, which damaged her liver. Doctors had said <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> would soon die without undergoing the transplant. They determined it would be easier to replace the entire five-organ group rather than just her liver and small intestine. Another multiple transplant has since been done at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Center in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> The 10-month-old patient was reported in good condition Wednesday after receiving a new liver, small intestine, pancreas and part of a stomach Feb. 9. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s condition began deteriorating Monday when she developed trouble breathing. Her blood pressure fell after surgeons changed drainage tubes inserted last month to relieve a buildup of bile in her transplanted liver, Ms. <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said. Doctors had ruled out the possibility of another transplant for <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> because she was too weak to withstand the operation, Ms. <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said.

 A <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> legislator had a suggestion to end discussion on bills designating `` official'' state animals, vegetables and minerals: Designate an official everything. `` We ought ... to have everyone fill out the darn list with everything they can think of and we would never have this come before us again,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Aydlette </PERSON>. `` We could have a state cat, a state snake, even a state disease.

 Supporters of a constitutional amendment to make English the country's official language fear that Hispanics are `` taking over,'' says a congressman who opposes the idea. `` If it is a symbolic measure with no impact whatsoever on our rights, then it is a frivolous exercise,'' Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on civil and criminal rights Wednesday. `` If it restricts civil rights on the basis of one's proficiency in English, then it is divisive and a dangerous amendment,'' said <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, a former migrant worker who is the son and grandson of Mexican-American migrant workers. Supporters testified Wednesday that the amendment was not intended to stifle freedom, but rather to clarify public policy and give legal protection to English, the glue that holds the country together. Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumway </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., said he does not want to see the nation drift unwittingly into a bilingual country `` We can not afford to wait a decade, or a generation, until our government is conducting its affairs in languages other than English,'' said <PERSON> Shumway </PERSON>, who has proposed one of the English amendments. And Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Mich </LOCATION>., said: `` English is our nation's language only by tradition, and if action is not taken soon, we could face a future of uncertainty in our basic communication, as well as ethnic and racial polarization. Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleczka </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., an opponent, said: `` It is in fact a direct attack on Hispanics No doubt about it.'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., a member of the panel conducting the hearing, said he questioned the motives behind the movement `` What are we trying to get at here?'' he asked. After the hearing, <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said advocates of official English `` have this fear they -LRB- Hispanics -RRB- are taking over. They're saying ... there's too many of them.'' <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> testified the amendment could alienate non-English speakers from vital services such as health care and deprive them of public translators for courts, hospitals, emergency services and police departments. According to testimony, 14 states have enacted official-English laws. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, president of a group called <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English and former staff director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> appointed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said the amendment would shift educational emphasis for bilingual children. The children would work more on acquiring English-language proficiency than on learning in their native language, she said.

 By naming a little-known <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> loyalist as armed forces chief of staff, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leaders appear to be trying to end friction between the regular army and <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION>, Western anaylsts say. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahbazi </PERSON> was sworn in Monday, three weeks after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> recaptured the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> in a lightning assault April 16-18 that caught the Iranians by surprise. In addition, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships sank or crippled two Iranian frigates and four other armed vessels April 18 after knocking out two Iranian oil platforms. <PERSON> Shahbazi </PERSON>'s appointment by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> `` is a direct consequence'' of those defeats, said <PERSON> Hans-Heino </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> specialist with the London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. Western analysts have speculated that more heads will roll among military and naval commanders. <PERSON> Shahbazi </PERSON>, 42, replaced Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ismael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohrabi </PERSON>, who had been the armed forces' chief of staff since 1984. Promoted from colonel, <PERSON> Shahbazi </PERSON> had been <PERSON> Sohrabi </PERSON>'s deputy for four years. `` It's like this fellow came out of nowhere,'' <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shahbazi </PERSON> has `` an outstanding record in the guerrilla warfare headquarters'' at <LOCATION> Ahvaz </LOCATION> in the oil-rich southwestern <LOCATION> Khuzistan </LOCATION> province, and it stressed his `` revolutionary and religious commitment.'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordesman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that <PERSON> Shahbazi </PERSON> is `` a <LOCATION> Khomeini </LOCATION> loyalist, a <LOCATION> Khomeini </LOCATION> professional, who has close links with the Revolutionary Guards.'' That indicated that the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> leadership is making a new effort to end friction _ and often outright hostility _ between the regular army and the increasingly powerful <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. The 350,000-strong Revolutionary Guards, made up of Islamic zealots who outnumber the army, have their own air and naval wings and get the pick of new hardware. When he swore in <PERSON> Shahbazi </PERSON> on Monday, President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> declared, `` The Revolutionary Guards and the army must work more closely together and coordinate their operations in every area.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had held <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION>, a dusty strip of land in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gulf </LOCATION>, since capturing it in February 1986, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> apparently had reduced its force in the enclave to about 20,000 men, half the size of a year ago. <PERSON> Faw </PERSON> was the only significant chunk of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had seized in the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war While <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s loss of <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> does not significantly change the military equation, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s victory was a major psychological blow to the Iranians.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> says he will end his run for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination but will form a political action committee to fund and train conservative Christian political candidates. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> announced Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he had offered his endorsement to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has mathematically clinched the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, and indicated he would withdraw from the race on Monday. However, after <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s announcement, an aide, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinsky </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> would suspend his campaign rather than withdraw outright, and would release his delegates, but at a later date. After his meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was asked by reporters at the White House whether he was withdrawing. `` I will be making that official on Monday,'' he replied. And asked whether he would be releasing his delegates, he answered, `` Of course, I will be releasing them.'' The <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> campaign later put out a press release saying <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had spoken with reporters about the meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and told them `` he is not withdrawing from the race nor is he releasing his delegates.'' The campaign did say <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> would make a statement about his campaign status on Monday. Calls to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> headquarters requesting a clarification were not returned Wednesday night. The new political action committee _ Americans for the Republic _ will actively support Christian candidates, according to <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Gattullo </PERSON>, a spokesman for Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign organization She said the staff of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> would switch to the new organization, keeping the same office in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, after the papers are filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginian-Pilot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; The Ledger-Star of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he likely would return to his job as the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, a job his son has held since <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> announced his candidacy. That came as a surprise to <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` I do n't have a comment to make,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` None of the staff or I ... have been provided any information by him at this point concerning what his future plans are.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had appeared since 1967 on the `` 700 Club'' program that is the flagship of the network. He left the program in 1986 to organize his presidential campaign and in September 1987 resigned both as the network's chief executive officer and as a pastor in the Southern Baptist church to run for office. The network immediately reported a dramatic drop in revenues and began laying off personnel. At the time, spokesmen refused to blame <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s political ambitions for the shortfall. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has spent more than $ 22 million on his campaign, has 46 delegates to the national convention. Of the March 8 Super Tuesday primaries, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> failed to win any.

 A former plumber from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> was charged in a federal indictment with money laundering and fraud after a company he ran in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> bounced a $ 500,000 check and failed to deliver a promised $ 4 million loan, authorities say. Prosecutors contend <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> defrauded unsuspecting business executives by claiming to control a $ 3 trillion gold bullion hoard from World War II. The company, <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arabian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was shut down by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> banking authorities in 1986. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the firm's president, and four other people including its former managing director, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koral </PERSON>, were named in a federal indictment made public Wednesday. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a former plumber from <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Koral </PERSON> have said in newspaper interviews that they were entrusted in 1981 with an <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> admiral's $ 3 trillion fortune in gold bullion. But they have not produced evidence that they actually have the gold. According to the five-count indictment made public in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Koral </PERSON> and their co-defendants were charged with conspiring to launder `` vast amounts of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency derived from illicit activities.'' The indictment described a complicated transaction in which $ 100,000 provided by an undercover <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent was transmitted to a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> bank through a brokerage account in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> without complying with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency transaction reporting rules. The transaction was completed with the unwitting help of an unidentified stockbroker at the <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, office of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> who was told that one of the defendants, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent, according to the indictment. The transaction was made through a <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> account purportedly set up to receive money from an Asian trust set up by the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> admiral, <PERSON> Seita </PERSON> <PERSON> Darma </PERSON>, the indictment charged. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Koral </PERSON> and two other defendants were also charged with defrauding <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> out of $ 100,000 in fees they charged to help the <LOCATION> Malvern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, company obtain a subcontract for a fictitious <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> project to create a multinational currency to stabilize the world economy. The company, also known as <ORGANIZATION> SCT </ORGANIZATION>, paid the monthly retainer to <ORGANIZATION> Kelgre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Gaithersburg </LOCATION>, Md. company headed by <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the indictment said. SCT officials were led to believe that <PERSON> European </PERSON> <PERSON> Arabian </PERSON> had been selected as a prime contractor for the fictitious top-secret project that was aimed at disrupting the underground economy and recapturing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency in foreign hands, according to the indictment. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is charged with telling the company it would be hired to conduct a $ 1.1 million feasibility study. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> allegedly told SCT that the subcontract award was being delayed while <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials tried to find a way to hide financing for the secret project in the federal budget. The company was also told the project included an effort to help Third World nations refinance their debt by bartering natural resources for loans, the indictment says. Company officials were told this phase of the contract was backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Seita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, according to the indictment. To lend credibility to the scheme, <ORGANIZATION> SCT </ORGANIZATION> officials were shown a Jan. 14, 1986 letter to European Arabian about the project from <PERSON> Carrye </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, identified as a special consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was charged separately with bilking two investors out of a total of $ 55,000 for applications for multi-million loans she falsely represented were guaranteed by the fictitious `` Project Recycle.'' She was also charged with impersonating a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official in other transactions. Also charged were <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gaithersburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicely </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON> is charged with participating in both the SCT fraud and money laundering schemes Nicely, identified in court papers as an associate of Kelgre Investment, is charged with participating in the money-laundering conspiracy. The indictment follows a nearly two-year investigation.

 Here is a transcript of pertinent communications between <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 243 last April 28 as the plane made an emergency landing at the <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> after suffering an in-flight breakup. The exchanges are between the co-pilot, <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> `` Mimi'' <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>, and the controller at the <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> airport tower: 23:48:33 _ Flight 243: <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> tower, <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> two forty three, we're inbound for landing ... We're just ah to the east of <LOCATION> Makena </LOCATION>, 10 -LRB- miles -RRB- east of <LOCATION> Makena </LOCATION> descending out of 13 -LRB- thousand feet -RRB- and we have rapid decompression. Ah we are unpressurized declaring an emergency. -LRB- A series of exchanges follow over confusion about the planes flight number. -RRB- 23:49:03 _ Tower: <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON> <PERSON> two-forty-three </PERSON>, say your position. 23:49:05 _ Flight 243: We're just ah to the east of <LOCATION> Makena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> descending out of 11 thousand -LRB- feet -RRB-. Request clearance into <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> for landing. Request the equipment. 23:49:16 _ Tower: Okay. The equipment is ... on the way. -LRB- The controller gives Flight 243 a transponder signal code so that the plane may be fully identified on his radar screen. Further confusion develops over the flight number because of poor radio transmission quality. -RRB- 23:49:58 _ Tower: two-forty-three, the equipment is on the roll. Plan straight in runway two and I'll keep you advised on any wind change. -LRB- The controller turns to other traffic and redirects one plane to another runway so as not to interfere with Flight 243's landing. -RRB- 23:52:11 _ Aloha two-forty-three, you still up -LRB- on the radio frequency -RRB- ... Aloha two-forty-three, <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>. ...

<HEAD>Big Writeoff By Texas S&amp;L Could be Sign of Coming Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings association wrote off a loss of nearly $ 1.2 billion in March, a portent of what could become the largest bailout ever for the federal regulator of thrift institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, in a report on the March balance sheets of the 3,120 S & amp; Ls it oversees, said Wednesday that one institution in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accounted for roughly half of the industry's decline in capital of $ 2.4 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulwider </PERSON> said the agency had decided not to identify the institution by name, explaining, `` It's not a public institution and it has not filed its report yet for the period. Nearly all of the remaining capital declines were also in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, where the economy is hard hit by depressed oil and real estate prices, the bank board said. The biggest S & amp; L bailout ever was the $ 1.3 billion rescue in September of <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. If the unidentified <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institution has posted losses in months before March, its bailout likely would top the Vernon rescue. The impending rescue of <ORGANIZATION> California-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which owns the largest S & amp; L in the nation, also is likely to surpass the Vernon figure. The bank board said the industry's capital declined by $ 3.3 billion in the first quarter, compared with an increase of $ 548 million in the first quarter of 1987. The figures indicate that the industry, which suffered its worst loss since the Great Depression last year at $ 6.8 billion, is in for another bad year. `` Those are terrible numbers,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, financial institutions analyst. `` What's really concerning is ... that annualizes out to a $ 12 billion to $ 13 billion loss for the year, which is roughly double what the industry showed in 1987.'' An institution's capital represents the amount of money left over after its assets are sold and its deposits and debts are paid off. As the number of insolvent S & amp; Ls has soared during the 1980s, the industry's capital-to-assets ratio _ a key measure of health _ has dwindled from 4.51 percent at the end of 1986 to 4.12 percent at the end of last year. It plummeted again in the first three months of this year to 3.44 percent. `` You're seeing a rate of decline ... that would exhaust the industry's capital in about 3 -LCB- years,'' <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> said. `` The losers in the industry, the insolvent thrifts, are just sinking much faster than the healthy thrifts can pull them out of it.'' The report lends new credence to arguments that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> does not have enough money to resolve the problems of the more than 500 insolvent institutions and that taxpayers' money may be needed. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in passing legislation last August, pledged to stand behind the insurance fund. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said it is too soon to tell whether the $ 20 billion available over the next three years will be enough. However, bank board officials said last month that an audit of the insurance fund, which backs deposits up to $ 100,000, showed that its liabilities exceeded its assets by $ 11.6 billion at the end of 1987, up from $ 6.3 billion at the end of 1986. An audit report due this month from the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> is expected to show an even larger deficit at the end of 1987 and some analysts say the insurance fund may eventually be $ 30 billion to $ 60 billion in the hole. The March decline at the single <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrift alone accounts for a fifth of the money _ $ 6 billion _ that the bank board is allotting to clean up Southwest institutions. The industry's earnings prospects, at least in the next few months, look dim, <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> said, because interest rates on what institutions pay for funds are rising faster than the rate they earn on their loan portfolios. One bright spot in the bank board report is the sixth consecutive monthly increase in deposits in March. Deposits flowed into savings institutions during the first three months of 1988 at the fastest rate since the fourth quarter of 1984. The bank board said net deposits increased by $ 4.5 billion in March, bringing net deposits for the first quarter of this year to $ 15.2 billion. That compares with net withdrawals of $ 5 billion in March 1987 and $ 8.2 billion for the first three months of 1987. The industry, until the October stock market crash, had been suffering a drain of deposits in what analysts labeled a slow-motion run. However, that trend reversed as investors pulled their money from the volatile stock market and sought the relative safety of government-insured S & amp; L accounts. Since then, an increase in Americans' savings rate has helped keep the deposits coming.

<HEAD>Researchers Says Science On Brink Of Correcting Flawed Immunity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A hormone that causes the body to produce immune cells is in the final stages of clinical testing and may provide a breakthrough in protecting the elderly against death from influenza and pneumonia, two researchers say. `` This may well be a research breakthrough for the treatment of disease among elderly people,'' Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging. The committee is conducting a hearing on research into the health problems of the elderly. Thymosin Alpha One, a form of the hormone thymosin, has now been given to elderly patients in two early clinical trials, and in both cases the level of immune action was increased, <PERSON> Ershler </PERSON> said Wednesday. Flu vaccine generally is effective in only about 25 percent of the elderly who receive it, he said. But in studies using Thymosin Alpha One, the effectiveness was increased to 70 percent. Researchers have long known that the immune system becomes increasingly weaker as people age, he said. As a result, `` infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly people,'' he said. <PERSON> Ershler </PERSON> said a deficiency of one of the immune cells, called T-cell lymphocyte, is caused by a decline in the function of the thymus gland. This, in turn, has been traced to a shortage of thymosin. An expanded study, using 400 patients at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Soldiers and Airmen's Home here, was conducted last fall and winter. Results have not been analyzed, said <PERSON> Ershler </PERSON>, but `` it may be a research breakthrough.'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a co-discoverer of thymosin, said the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> study has `` great promise.'' `` It is hoped that within two years we'll be able to apply this new approach to lower the incidence of flu and pneumonia among the elderly,'' <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> told the committee. He said influenza affects millions of elderly Americans annually, costs hundreds of millions of dollars in medical care and causes about 25,000 deaths among people over age 65.

<TEXT>
 The government said Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has made no deal with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about stepping down and there will be none `` if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aggression and violation of Panamanian sovereignty continue.'' The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Panapress </ORGANIZATION> reported on Wednesday night that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had `` entered in direct contact with <PERSON> Gen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' The report came shortly after an administration source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would drop drug charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if he agrees to step down as Defense Forces chief and leave the country, at least temporarily. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, director of the government's National Information System, or <ORGANIZATION> SNI </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he did not know if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had telephoned <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in an effort to find a way out of the crisis between the two nations. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> also said he did not know if the offer to drop the charges had been formally presented to the general. `` There has been no agreement about anything,'' said a statement he read to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> over the telephone. `` Upon being informed of the existence of such reports, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> SNI </ORGANIZATION> categorically, ` The sovereignty of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is not negotiable.' `` Such reports only come from sources interested in sidetracking the conversations and in aggravating the existing situation. These reports form part of the confusion and confrontation provoked by certain elements of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> establishment.'' <PERSON> Panapress </PERSON> said on Wednesday night: `` Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has said there can be no deal if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aggression and the violation of Panamanian sovereignty continue.'' The source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that under the proposed deal <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would step down, probably in August, and would stay out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> until after its next presidential elections. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration began imposing economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> 2 -LCB- months ago. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hoped the measures would force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> into exile, but he has resisted and appears entrenched. The general, as chief of the 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, is the country's de facto ruler. Last summer, he was accused by his former second-in-command of involvement in political assassination and electoral fraud. On Feb. 5, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on federal drug-smuggling and money-laundering charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He denies the charges, contending they are part of an attempt to replace him with a leader amenable to a strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> into the next century. The 1977 <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> obliges <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to cede control of the waterway and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases along it by the year 2000. <PERSON> Panapress </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` sent a special mission to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to dialogue with the leader of the Panamanian Defense Forces.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> responded, `` no comment,'' when asked if <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, who the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in recent weeks to talk with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, met in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Wednesday with the general or his representatives.

 Meeting with their leaders, more than 4,000 Nicaraguan rebels sought to resolve a simmering dispute over whether to continue peace talks with the leftist Sandinista government. Also Wednesday, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s vice president said at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that the rift among the rebels threatened the peace negotiations. Rebel sources said the U.S.-backed fighters, also known as Contras, met with their civilian and military leaders at the jungle town of <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION>, 185 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> and six miles from the Nicaraguan border. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the dissident rebels accuse <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> military commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> of corruption and inefficiency and want him replaced. Unlike the civilian Contra leaders, <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> reportedly opposes forging a lasting peace with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said in a telephone interview there was only `` minimal'' opposition to his command from `` a group of parasites'' within rebel ranks, whom he did not identify. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, 46, was <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s representative to the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, under President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, the rightist dictator overthrown by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in 1979. He is said to command a total of 8,000 rebels. Three civilian leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance _ <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Bosco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> _ were at the jungle meeting, the sources said. Also present were eight dissident Contra military leaders who on Sunday publicly accused <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> of opposing negotiations for a more permanent truce with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, the sources said. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s vice president, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>, said on Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that his government was not sure if rebel fighters would honor any agreement reached by their political leaders. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said the `` open rebellion'' against <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> `` represents a serious limitation'' to the talks. `` We do n't know now if what the political leadership of the Contras is going to discuss with us in the next round of negotiations is going to be accepted by this military leadership under the command of Col. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. He spoke at a news conference before the opening of a special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session on economic aid to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> hinted he might use force to bring the dissidents back into line but expressed hope that he and <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, the top Contra civilian leader, will find a solution to the problem. `` I am sure that once the fighters understand the reality of the situation, they will change their attitude,'' he said in the telephone interview. On March 23, Sandinista and Contra leaders signed a preliminary accord aimed at ending the 6 -LCB- - year-old civil war A 60-day truce went into effect April 1, during which the two sides were supposed to negotiate conditions for a lasting peace. Two rounds of high-level negotiations in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> since have failed to produce substantial progress. Foremost among issues dividing the two sides is a Sandinista demand that the Contras lay down their weapons. The date for the next round of talks has not been set.

<TEXT>
 For <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, years of congressional wrangling over whether to compensate natives of the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> who were forced into camps during World War II have taken their toll. `` It's just too little, too late,'' she said. `` The old ones who deserve it the most are gone.'' Hope and her family were among 110 Aleuts from <LOCATION> Unalaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> villages ordered from their homes in July 1942 after the Japanese bombed and strafed the island's Dutch Harbor. They were herded aboard a steamship that took them to a camp in southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, purportedly to protect them from harm. They were not alone. An estimated 880 Aleuts were evacuated from the Aleutians. Many houses later were ransacked or destroyed by soldiers and sailors. Photographs, diaries, icons and other possessions left behind were damaged or stolen, residents say. About 10 percent of the Aleuts died in the camps. Some never went home. It has been estimated that half the camps' survivors have since died. The Japanese seized three of the western Aleutians _ <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Agattu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION> _ and occupied them between 1942 and 1943. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, conference committee staff members were scheduled to meet today to work out differences in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of a measure authorizing reparations to Japanese-Americans and Aleuts forced from their homes in the opening months of the war. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, considered likely to be adopted, would pay the Aleut camp survivors $ 12,000 each, set up a $ 5 million trust fund for the six villages where people were forced from their homes, authorize $ 1.4 million to restore and rehabilitate churches damaged or destroyed in the war and pay the Aleuts between $ 12 million and $ 15 million for the loss of <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which has remained under military control. Japanese-Americans forced into camps would receive $ 20,000 each, and virtually nothing else. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirtland </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer hired in 1978 to represent the Aleuts before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, thinks the legislation, re-introduced each year since 1983, will make it to the president this year. Hope was 5 years old when the Japanese planes arrived. Her father was English, her mother, Aleut. Her father, the village postmaster, was allowed to remain behind because of his nationality. `` We had 48 hours to get ready. We were told to take nothing but a very, very few belongings,'' she recalled. Hope, her mother, two brothers and a sister joined other Aleuts from the island's three villages for the voyage. Eventually they were deposited at a burned-out cannery at <LOCATION> Burnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. `` It was nothing but a ghost gown. There was no plumbing, no heat, just an abandoned old cannery. There was no running water. You could see through the ceiling.'' Medical facilities were virtually non-existent. Tuberculosis was a threat. Village hunters and fishermen used to the treeless mountains of <LOCATION> Unalaska </LOCATION> were thrown into a strange environment. `` It was like trying to live a subsistence lifestyle in a foreign country,'' <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> said. For the three years the family was held at the camp, <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>'s father was allowed only one 10-day visit, <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> said Her mother worked at canneries to earn money, and provided medical care to camp residents. Her brother left to work on a fishing boat. `` I just do n't understand why they did what they did,'' <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Aleut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a regional native corporation, and the <ORGANIZATION> Aleutian-Pribilof </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> led the drive for Aleut reparations. <LOCATION> Kirtland </LOCATION>'s firm searched archives and put together reams of evidence about camp conditions and the wrongs committed during and after the evacuation. At about the same time, a nine-member federal Commission On Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians was appointed by the president and congressional leaders. `` Nine volumes of documentary evidence were given to commission,'' <LOCATION> Kirtland </LOCATION> said. The panel held hearings around <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and recommended compensation for the Aleuts in June 1983. Just as the compensation is pending, the scars of war remain on <LOCATION> Unalaska </LOCATION>. Trench lines cut the mountains. Bunkers, pillboxes and machine-gun nests dot the landscape. The past is never far away. Hope works as a receptionist at <LOCATION> Unalaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, near the house where she was born. `` I do n't feel like I deserve anything; it's my mother and father _ they went through the anguish. They're the ones who really deserve it.'' Her father died in 1956; her mother, 10 years later.

<HEAD>Study Says Beef Fat Not As Bad As Experts Once Believed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Beef, which for years has been cast as the villain in the fight against heart disease, may not be so bad after all, say researchers who found that a major form of saturated fat lowers cholesterol. While too much fatty beef such as hamburger and prime rib will clearly raise cholesterol levels, most people can eat moderate helpings of lean meat without fear, the researchers said. The researchers cautioned that only men were enrolled in the study, so the findings might not apply to women. But other experts said the study of 11 men is too small and preliminary to reach a conclusion. All 11 were healthy volunteers, ranging from their late 50s to early 70s. Beef got a bad name because it is high in saturated fat. Until now, it was assumed that all saturated fats endangered the heart by increasing cholesterol, which clogs arteries. The study, published in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, suggests that the situation may be more complicated. Beef contains two major forms of saturated fat, and the researchers found that one raises cholesterol while the other lowers it. This means that meat is probably not as bad as health experts have long believed, said Dr. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON>, the study's senior author and a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON>, who also is a past chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said people should still follow the widely adopted dietary guidelines for avoiding all kinds of fat, including saturated fat. But he believes beef can be a regular part of a sensible diet, as long people eat small portions of about 3 ounces and stick to lean cuts, especially select-grade meat. `` You do n't really have to cut meat out of the diet in order to keep a low cholesterol -LRB- level -RRB-,'' he said in an interview Wednesday. `` That's an important message, because beef is rich in protein and iron.'' Fats from plants and animals differ in their proportions of various fatty acids. Safflower oil, for instance, is high in oleic acid, which lowers the body's cholesterol levels, while palm oil contains high levels of palmitic acid, which raises cholesterol. Beef fat is high in both palmitic acid and stearic acid. Both are saturated fatty acids. Unlike polyunsaturated fats such as corn oil, they are solid when cool. In the study, the volunteers drank three liquid formula diets for three weeks each. They were high in palmitic acid, stearic acid or oleic acid. The researchers found that the volunteers' blood cholesterol levels dropped 14 percent while they consumed stearic acid and 10 percent while on oleic acid, compared to when they used the high-palmitic acid diet. Today's report was accompanied by an editorial by Drs. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Aging at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. They wrote that the study `` demonstrates convincingly'' that stearic acid lowers cholesterol. However, they added, people should still try to hold down fat consumption, and `` this study should not change our chief dietary message to the American public.'' Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRosa </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` It's a nice little piece of work,'' <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> said, `` but it's not the basis for dietary recommendations.'' Guidelines adopted by the association and other groups urge people to limit total fat intake to about 30 percent of total calories. Saturated fat should be less than 10 percent of the day's calories

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has told several steel-state senators the American steel industry will be a clear winner under the proposed U.S.-Canada free trade agreement. `` There is no doubt in my mind that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry will be a net beneficiary of this agreement _ no doubt,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Wednesday during a joint meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> antitrust subcommittee. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said American steelmakers will benefit from the gradual elimination of the two nations' tariffs because Canadian tariffs on imported steel are about double the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> average.

 <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> returned with a vengeance to his late-night show, poking fun at revelations of White House astrology in a monologue he wrote himself to end reruns forced by a 2-month-old writers' strike. `` I just could not stay away any longer from all things that are going on in the country. I was compelled to come back,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said Wednesday in his first new show since the strike began March 7. `` You know, we finally have a clue now as to what the hell -LRB- are -RRB- the <LOCATION> Looney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunes </LOCATION> things that have been coming out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' he told viewers of `` The Tonight Show.'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> referred to revelations by former White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regularly consulted an astrologer to determine President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s schedule. `` We apparently have a new cabinet officer in the government I was not aware of _ the <ORGANIZATION> Secretary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, Education and Soothsaying. `` I am not an expert on astrology, I know a little bit about it, but I understand the horoscope with the chart as they call it, is divided into the so-called 12 houses, and I just did n't know the White House was one of them,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> quipped. `` Apparently the astrologist says that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s sign is the rising house of <LOCATION> Aquarius </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s house is, I think, in the house of <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON>. I could be wrong, it could be <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Blass </PERSON>, but I think that's close,'' he joked, referring to the fashion designers. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> also quoted an astrologist as saying that `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> performs at his best during a full moon.'' `` Big deal,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said. `` So does the Wolfman.'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> pointed out that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he never made a policy decision based on astrology, then _ dropping into an imitation of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s voice _ <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said, `` Well, because that little pointer on my Ouija board moved to ` No.''' The host of the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> show also found time to poke fun at his marriage and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake predictions involving 16th century seer Nostradamus. `` Things were getting a little testy around the homestead,'' he said. `` I really believe that one more week off and my marriage would be resolved by small arms fire.'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> mentioned the stir in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> because of persistent rumors that Nostradamus forecast an earthquake for a city widely believed to be <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` He was a flim-flam man of the 16th century,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said. `` If Nostradamus were alive today he would be <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> entertained millions of television viewers with stunts such as the opening of <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>'s vault. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> announced last week he would return to the air, writing his own monologues. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, who is not a member of the striking <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said at that time there had been good-faith negotiations and that all possibilities of reaching an agreement with the movie and TV industry were exhausted. `` We're glad to be back. As far as the writers' strike, we're not going to discuss it,'' he said `` I have a lot of friends who are writers. It is not fun to come to work when you see your friends who you've known for many years standing out on a picket line. `` And it's a weird picket line. The writers are out there holding up these signs and there's nothing on them,'' he quipped.

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> blessed <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> on his 100th birthday, as such diverse celebrities as <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> sang the legacies of the composer who `` set the world tapping.'' The prolific songwriter, a longtime recluse, did n't attend the three-hour celebration Wednesday night before a packed house at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, although he was believed to be listening via a hookup from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mansion. The pageantry started big and ended bigger, with the Army Chorus and soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, filling the stage in front of a 30-piece orchestra, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts standing in the aisles and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>'s mezzo-soprano voice soaring above them in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s `` God Bless America.'' Then, most of the evening's performers stood in front of the audience of 4,000, joined hands and arms, and everybody sang a lusty `` There's No Business Like Show Business,'' another <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> classic. `` When <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> began writing 83 years ago, American popular music had no voice of its own,'' said the violinist <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. `` We were a hodge-podge of nationalities and noises. But he heard nothing but melodies. `` American music was born at his piano. By 30, he was a legend. Out of the fabric of our lives, <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has given us a place we call home. It was this love -LRB- of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> -RRB- that gave him the strength to write the music that now lasts forever,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. Composer <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Authors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, recounted the origin of the birthday tribute, which is to be televised May 27 on CBS. `` A year ago, I received a call from <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. During the conversation, I said, ` Next year is your 100th birthday. May ASCAP present a tribute?' Without skipping a beat, he said, ` What's the hurry?' So we waited.'' Six months later, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> approved the celebration and suggested ticket sales benefit the <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has written 1,500 songs, 19 Broadway musicals and 18 Hollywood musicals, beginning with the first talking picture, `` The Jazz Singer.'' The event was a finale to a full day of tributes that began with a midnight serenade outside <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> house. At midday, 14 cast members of the Broadway show `` A Chorus Line,'' offered an enthusiastic songfest at the Central Park Arsenal. Their spirited medley ranged from love songs such as `` They Say That Falling in Love is Wonderful,'' to the torch song `` What'll I Do,'' to the humorous `` You Ca n't Get a Man With a Gun.'' On <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 15 handicapped Boy Scouts sang `` Happy Birthday'' and `` God Bless America'' during the dedication of a new log cabin named for <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. He had donated the residuals from the patriotic tune to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. Meanwhile, patients in 100 <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> hospitals and nursing homes around the nation geared up to sing `` God Bless America'' simultaneously. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was part of a pantheon of great musical comedy composers that included <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>. Of his theater contemporaries, only director <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, who turns 101 in June, survives. `` No one could take your mind off your troubles like <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>. His music set the world tapping. You just had to let yourself go,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who then sang `` Let Yourself Go.'' Among the other celebrities who joined in the speeches and songs were <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>, <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Clooney </PERSON>. Born <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baline </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at age 2. His family settled on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> where, as a young boy, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> got jobs singing on the Bowery. He worked as song plugger and a singing waiter at a <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> cafe. It was there he learned to play the piano, laboriously picking out tunes with one finger. The self-taught musician writes the same way. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> spent the day `` quietly at home'' and did not plan to be at <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, said his secretary, <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. `` He's never made a big thing about his birthdays,'' she said. `` Let's face it, he's not 22 years old.''

 A private study says discriminatory voter registration procedures are disenfranchising the poor, minority and disabled citizens throughout the country. Among the practices are arbitrary registration hours, inconvenient registration locations, `` mysterious purging of voters without notice, denial of registration before an election,'' said a statement from Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., who is the author of legislation to correct such practices The <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in hearings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> in 1984 and 1985 `` documented numerous examples of discriminatory practices,'' the group said on Wednesday.

The commission recommended legislation to permit registration by mail, election-day registration, and a congressional investigation into denial of the right to vote for homeless people.

Ong, also secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, called the gathering at congress headquarters a union rally, not a political demonstration.

Sometimes one arm of the bureaucracy does not know what the other arm is doing. They think they are always right. They do not admit mistakes. They seldom apologize. They prefer denials and sometimes resort to lies.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gong </PERSON> said he had not read Ong's speech and declined comment <PERSON> Gong </PERSON> denied the Singaporean government's allegations against <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, saying: `` Mr. <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> was doing what American diplomats are expected to do in any country, namely to keep in touch with a broad spectrum of individuals in order to report accurately developments in the country in question.'' A Home Affairs Ministry statement on May 7 said <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Seong </PERSON> `` and other lawyers to contest the elections against the government, and had involved himself in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s domestic politics. The governing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is heavily favored to retain control of this island republic of 2.6 million people in elections that must be held by December 1989. The party holds all but one of 79 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and there is no viable opposition capable of dislodging it. <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> `` was trying to manipulate and instigate Singaporeans, in order to bring about a particular political outcome,'' the government alleged. His ouster was a surprising jolt to normally warm U.S.-Singapore relations. The diplomatic row is the latest in a complex chain of events that began with the May-June 1987 arrests of 22 Singaporeans accused of belonging to a `` clandestine communist network.'' They were seized under the Internal Security Act which allows indefinate detention without trial. All but one were freed by last Dec. 26, most of them with restrictions on their movements. <PERSON> Seong </PERSON> was arrested April 19 with eight of the 22 former detainees. That was less than 24 hours after the eight proclaimed their innocence and said they had been abused and coerced into making incriminating statements. On April 28, the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the eight had sworn new declarations withdrawing their allegations and reconfirming their original guilt.

<HEAD>Police: Gunmen Tried to Kidnap Cartoonist's Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two masked gunmen who invaded the home of cartoonist <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> tried to kidnap his wife, officials said. `` It was obviously an attempted kidnap _ ransom,'' <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` This was a targeted criminal act. They knew exactly who the victims were.'' The incident took place on Sunday but did not become public until Tuesday when neighbors of the cartoonist spoke to reporters from the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> and recounted that two armed men had invaded the home. However, it was not until the sheriff's department issued a statement Wednesday that it became clear that a kidnap attempt had been made. `` There is a delicate balance between the rights of victims and the need to know,'' the sheriff said in explaining why he did not release the information earlier. `` Victims should always come first.'' <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, creator of the `` Peanuts'' comic strip, declined to comment. The men were armed with revolvers when they entered the home but were scared off when the cartoonist's daughter, <PERSON> Jill </PERSON>, pulled her car into the driveway minutes later. Neither <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, 65, nor his wife, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, was hurt. The men told the Schulzes at gunpoint that they were going to take the wife, according to the news release. `` They got in there and got started with the episode and were interrupted I think before they could do everything they set up to do,'' Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON> said the decision to keep the incident quiet was made to protect the <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> family. Press Democrat Editor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Parman </PERSON> said the sheriff's department `` apparently has a policy of releasing information at their discretion.'' `` The public has a right to know that there are two armed, dangerous men at large in this community,'' he said.

<HEAD>Van Gogh Painting Sells For $13.75 Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> painting sold for $ 13.75 million, the fourth highest price paid at an auction, but the sale disappointed a standing-room-only crowd after a string of record prices for the artist's paintings. `` Portrait of <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravoux </PERSON>,'' which <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> finished shortly before his suicide, sold at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction house Wednesday night to an anonymous buyer who bid by telephone. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s had estimated <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s 1890 portrait of his innkeeper's 13-year-old daughter would bring $ 15 million, and the reaction of the audience was subdued in contrast to the applause that usually greets a record price. However, auctioneer <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Burge </PERSON> insisted afterward that <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s was not disappointed. `` It's a wonderful price for a beautiful picture,'' he said. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Varenne </PERSON>, an art dealer from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, said he was `` a little surprised'' that the painting fetched only $ 13.75 million. But he added the portrait was `` not an easy one to live with'' and that may have affected the price. `` It's of a girl who's attractive but not that attractive. And there's the possibility that the blue background is not that appealing to a lot of people,'' he said. In the painting, <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON>, dressed in blue, sits in profile on a chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue ribbon, her gaze is serene, her posture correct and her hands are folded demurely in front of her. The background is a deep, midnight blue. The painting is the latest in a string of paintings by <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>, who had trouble selling his art during his lifetime, to fetch a record price. `` Irises'' last year brought $ 53.9 million, the highest price ever paid at auction for a painting. The second and third highest prices bid at an auction were also for van <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> paintings. The portrait was one of 70 lots offered for sale at an auction of impressionist and modern art that fetched $ 63,173,000. Eleven works of art did not find buyers despite a packed house. The second highest bid Wednesday was $ 6.6 million paid by an anonymous private collector for <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON>'s `` L'Ombrelle,'' a painting of a woman in a garden holding a parasol and bouquet of violets. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassatt </PERSON>'s, `` The Conversation,'' a pastel on paper of two women talking to each other, sold for $ 4.51 million, a record for the artist. <PERSON> Burge </PERSON> called it `` a beautiful picture'' and `` an extreme leap forward by the artist.'' It was bought by an anonymous private collector. The fourth highest bid was $ 4.4 million paid by an anonymous private collector for <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlaminck </PERSON>'s `` Le Pont de Chatou,'' an oil on canvas in brilliant colors of a bridge across the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Giacometti </PERSON>'s 1940s sculpture of three skinny, walking men, `` Trois Hommes Qui Marchent,'' sold for $ 3.85 million to an anonymous buyer, the most ever paid at auction for a 20th century sculpture. `` Portrait of <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravoux </PERSON>'' was one of three <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> did of his innkeeper's daughter. The most lifelike and detailed of the trio is in a private collection in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The other, which shows only the girl's face, is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>. The picture was made a month before <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> committed suicide at age 37 in 1890 in the village of <LOCATION> Auvers </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. In a 1956 essay, <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravoux </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> wrote that she did n't immediately appreciate her portrait. `` It was somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was true to life,'' wrote Mrs. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON>, who died in 1965 at the age of 88. However, she was quoted in a 1953 interview as saying, `` <PERSON> Monsieur </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> divined not the young girl I was, but the woman I was to become.''

<HEAD>Milk Antibodies Effective Against Traveler's Diarrhea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers say they are encouraged by experimental use of a derivative of cow's milk to prevent traveler's diarrhea and hope to test their discovery on people going to developing countries. In a report today, they said that powdered concentrations of milk antibodies appeared to protect people from the effects of E. coli bacteria, a common cause of diarrhea. `` These preliminary results are highly encouraging,'' they wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers, led by Dr. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tacket </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, found that the treatment may provide an alternative to prescription antibiotics and over-the-counter bismuth subsalicylate, which can keep people from getting diarrhea. The researchers said that about half of all travelers to developing countries get diarrhea. `` We want to do a field study to see if it works among travelers,'' said <PERSON> Tacket </PERSON>. `` Our study was a very artificial situation.'' To make the concentrate, cows were first vaccinated with varieties of E. coli that cause diarrhea. The cows then produced antibodies in their milk that protected them from these microbes. The researchers removed these antibodies and prepared them in powder form. Ten volunteers drank the powdered E. coli antibodies dissolved in water three times a day for three days. Ten others got other forms of antibodies. Then all were given diarrhea-causing E. coli. None of the 10 who got the E. coli antibodies developed diarrhea. However, nine of the 10 in the comparison group got the illness.

<HEAD>Skylab Astronaut Says Russians Have Passed America In Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOYT HARWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A scientist in the Skylab program of the early 1970s says the `` plodding'' Soviets have since surpassed the Americans in manned space missions. `` All our accomplishments of 15 years ago should be buried in the dust by now. Unfortunately, there is some dust on them, but it is not American dust,'' ex-astronaut <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said Wednesday at a reunion with eight other former Skylab crew members. `` The Russians are the people who have continuously manned space stations up there. They are the turtles of the space race. They kept plodding along.'' The three Skylab flights, from May 1973 to February 1974, took almost 183,000 pictures of the sun and more than 40,000 of the earth. `` We learned a lot about solar physics, how the sun works,'' said <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, now a space consultant at <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` It is the largest contribution ever made in that area. `` In earth observations, it led into what we currently are doing _ better monitoring and understanding of our environment and how to control part of it to some degree. `` Also, we learned a lot of the physiological aspects of man going into space _ important information for future flights and also for spinoffs for medicine on earth.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could regain the lead in space technology, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said, if the government and nation understand what is needed, establish long-range goals and make financial commitments to match them. `` We need to find the best way to draw in all the good talent that exists in our country and a way to retain them in the work force for many years,'' he said. `` We need to streamline the organization _ the whole military and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> infrastructure _ in the way in which we manage the combined effort, as well as in the individual agencies themselves and the programs. `` There is enthusiasm, capability and knowledge ready to put us out ahead again, not only for competitive reasons but for practical benefits and human reasons.'' At one of the reunion sessions, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for its proposed space station, noted that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has been without a permanent manned orbiting facility for almost 10 years. Important research could have been accomplished during that time, <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said. `` Unlike Skylab, the space station will lend itself to ongoing modifications,'' he said. `` We will be able to tailor it to meet the changing requirements of experimenters over its projected 30-year lifespan.'' <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said that some parts of the Apollo program `` were scrapped in the wake of the Apollo 1 fire,'' in which three astronauts died on the launch pad. He added, `` It would be tragic if this should happen again as a result of the Challenger accident,'' which killed seven astronauts in 1986.

<HEAD>Report: Suspects May Have Been Involved In Past ANC Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four whites charged with possession of an impressive arms cache may have been involved in previous attacks carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper reported today. Police announced on Wednesday they had made their biggest arms seizure ever in connection with the arrests of three men and one woman who allegedly were acting on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s military wing. The four suspects also had a `` hit-list'' of top police officials, according to police. Arms seized included a Soviet-made SAM-7 ground-to-air missile, limpet mines, hand grenades, assault rifles, pistols, machine guns, mortars and explosives, police said. They said the four had planned to use the missile to shoot down a police helicopter at a recent fair. Police have not released the suspects' names, but have said the three men are South African citizens and the woman is a foreigner. The four are college educated and in their 20s and 30s, police said, adding that two are military draft dodgers and one is a former journalist. The Citizen, a pro-government daily, said without citing sources that at least one of the four was believed involved in <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> attacks carried out in the early 1980s. The mostly black <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> was outlawed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1960 and began a sabotage-and-bombing campaign the following year aimed at toppling white-minority rule. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, a leading authority on the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and a lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION>, said the arrests illustrate `` the continuing trend of young, well-educated liberal and left-wing whites -LRB- to -RRB- identify themselves with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>.'' Lodge said white participation in the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s military wing `` obviously has a greater impact on the attitudes of white <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> than the involvement of blacks.'' Few whites have been involved in the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s military operations, although there have been several highly publicized cases in recent years. Following a March 17 car bombing that killed three people, police said the leading suspect was <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosskopf </PERSON>, a white South African and an alleged <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> member who remains at large. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> described the four suspects as `` a highly specialized terror unit.'' He alleged that the suspects had been trained in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and had radio transmitters which they used to communicate with <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. He said they were captured Sunday at a farmhouse near <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, where they had been staying since early this year. The South African Press Association, citing unidentified police sources, said a disenchanted <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> member apparently gave authorities the tip that led them to the four suspects. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said police still were investigating how the weapons were brought into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but he said the arms came overland through <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>. Police have announced numerous arrests of alleged <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> members in recent months and say they have substantially weakened the group's ability to operate inside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> There have been more than 70 bombings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since a nationwide state of emergency was imposed in June 1986, but the frequency has fallen sharply in recent months.

 Death row inmate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, bitter over a reprieve from his scheduled execution, acknowledged killing a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> insurance office manager and said those trying to save him were `` bleeding-heart jerks.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, whose lethal injection was halted about six hours before it would have been carried out, blamed death penalty opponents for persuading his mother in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> to pursue a request to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a reprieve. `` This woman does n't know me,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said of his mother, <PERSON> Alexzene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` She may understand some child who was under her care, but she does n't understand this mature adult male.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he did not want the stay because he does not want to waste away on death row. `` This was a decision I had made. It was the last act of freedom I could make,'' he said. `` It's frightening, to tell you the truth.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 37, was sentenced to die for the 1983 robbery-slaying of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohus </PERSON>, manager of a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> insurance office. He previously insisted he was innocent, but in an interview Wednesday detailed that murder and what he said were at least six other slayings, including the mutilation deaths of three people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and one of a baby in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But authorities in both areas said there was no evidence such killings had occurred. He also told of a murder in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in 1978 and a second besides the baby in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1979. He said the baby was purchased in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> for $ 300, used in voodoo rituals and left on a highway leading to the <LOCATION> Verrazano-Narrows </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> where it likely would be run over. `` Look what you're trying to save!'' he said, describing death penalty opponents who want to keep him alive as `` just a bunch of bleeding-heart jerks.'' `` I'm still going to be executed,'' he insisted. `` It may take a little longer.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rohus </PERSON> was shot to death because of snide remarks the insurance office manager made while <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was robbing the place. `` I killed him the same as I would a fly in my soup bowl,'' he said. `` I shot him through the heart _ almost at point-blank range _ to get money. And then I ran out.'' <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, has described the former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> tarot-card reader as the most evil and dangerous man he's ever prosecuted. `` That guy's got a little bit of insight,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> responded, when told of <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>'s comment. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said his involvement in voodoo began in high school. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> ritual slayings occurred in <LOCATION> Orangeburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> the spring of 1981, he said. Records there show five murders in 1981, four shooting victims and one in a fire. County Sheriff C.R. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Wednesday he could recall no such incidents like those described by <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in 1981, in the few years before that or since. If <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> committed such crimes in <LOCATION> Orangeburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the bodies were never found there, the sheriff said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, police spokeman Sgt. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said he was unaware of any homicide involving a mutilated infant whose body was left on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Mrs. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s appeal questioned her son's mental competence. He said the competency issue was linked to a 1978 <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> armed robbery charge, to which he pleaded innocent due to temporary insanity. `` The insanity issue is brought forth by lawyers to get people off,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` That's what my lawyer recognized.''

 The military charged today that foreign sponsors have stepped up weapons shipments to Afghan guerrillas and sent in more military advisors, endangering Soviet troops who are about to march out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> reported in a front-page dispatch from its military correspondents at <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that there is great anxiety about the withdrawal that begins Sunday. `` They are facing 1,500 kilometers -LRB- 940 miles -RRB- of mountainous, war-torn roads,'' the newspaper said of Soviet soldiers who will be among the first to pull out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s southern neighbor. `` And we know very well that roads in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are on the forward edge of the undeclared war. It is necessary to be prepared for the possibility of armed provocations.'' The newspaper said rebel activity had been stepped up in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION> and other provinces. `` Taking advantage of the pullback of Soviet and Afghan troops from border areas of those regions in the depth of the country, the opposition and its foreign patrons have sharply increased the number of caravans with weapons, delivering them _ not only at night now but also in the daytime,'' the paper claimed. `` In the military formations there has been a noticeable growth in the number of foreign military advisers, who organize joint actions by groups from different Moslem parties,'' the newspaper said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been the insurgents' chief arms supplier. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said the preparations for withdrawal were nearly complete at the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> headquarters of the `` limited military contingent,'' as the 115,000 Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are referred to in the state-run press. The dispatch did not make clear, however, how many would leave in the first march north or when headquarters would be evacuated. It said the first troops to leave would be motorized rifle regiments, paratroopers, scouts and pilots, but gave no other details. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has been in the throes of civil war since April 1978, when a Soviet-inspired revolution brought a Marxist government to power. Soviet soldiers intervened in December 1979 to install <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON> as the Afghan leader and to help troops loyal to him put down a widespread insurrection. <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON> was replaced by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in May 1986 and has since taken refuge in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 A survey of former major leaguers concludes that baseball is a healthy way of life, and the infield is the best place to be. Doctors from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> poured over baseball encyclopedias and death certificates to learn when and how players died. `` The main thing we found was the overall protective effect of being an athlete,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterbor </PERSON>. `` The death rate we found was 94 percent of that expected.'' The researchers said the findings support the idea that getting plenty of exercise and being in good physical shape early in life help keep folks healthy as they age. The report found that infielders had the lowest death rate, while catchers had the highest. Pitchers and outfielders were in between. <PERSON> Waterbor </PERSON> said the men's body builds may help explain these differences. `` The infielders tend to be average-looking to thin people who can move quickly, compared to catchers, who are built more like bricks,'' <PERSON> Waterbor </PERSON> said in an interview. The study also found that those who had lengthy playing careers or good records lived the longest, although these differences were small. The study, published in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, was based on 985 men who played major-league ball between 1911 and 1915. Their longevity and causes of death were compared to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> white male population of the same age. Among other findings: _ By far the most common cause of death was heart disease The researchers were surprised to find that the death rate from the disease was 10 percent higher for ball players than for average American men. _ Baseball players were also somewhat more likely than other people to die from cancer But they were substantially less apt to die from infections, lung disease, diabetes and accidents, among other things. _ Catchers were more likely than usual to die from pancreatic cancer, pitchers from <PERSON> Hodgkin </PERSON>'s disease and outfielders from digestive ulcers _ The researchers successfully followed up on 958 players, of whom 16 were still alive in 1984 The average age of death was just under 71.

<HEAD>Dollar Climbs Slightly Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar climbed marginally today against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, while stock prices also posted a slight gain after falling sharply in early trading. The dollar ended at 124.39 yen, up 0.15 yen from its finish on Wednesday. After opening the day at 124.35, the dollar moved little, remaining between the 124.35 and 124.46 yen. `` The market was motionless throughout the day,'' said an exchange dealer at a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trading was quiet lacking incentives to direct the market, he said, adding the impact on Wednesday's half-percentage point increase in the prime lending rate of large American banks, which boosted the dollar in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading, tapered off quite early. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which lost a big 251.20 points Wednesday, gained back 51.53 points, or 0.18 percent, closing the day at 27,212.58. The Nikkei index, the main market barometer, lost as much as 194.95 points in the first 15 minutes of trading, dropping below the 27,000-level for the first time since April 22. The fall, prompted by the overnight plunge on Wall Street caused by prime rate hikes and concern over inflation, turned investors to hunt for bargains, traders said. `` There are several factors, such as the result of the upcoming 30-year bond sale in the quarterly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury refunding, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for March, which investors are keeping eyes on in making major moves,'' said <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. The overall buying mood was strong, however, and unless something really surprising happens, the market will maintain its bullish trend, he said. Popular issues included shipbuildings and machineries. Chemicals, non-ferrous metals, textiles and rubbers also gained ground. Lower issues were steels and electricals. Volume of the first-section trade stood at an esimated 900 million shares, against 1.1 billion shares changed hands on Wednesday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has informed <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that its correspondents have been barred from traveling to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to cover the scheduled withdrawal of Soviet troops. Foreign Ministry officials said on Wednesday the Afghan government had objected to a question posed by an AP correspondent during a recent news conference held by <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Isayenko </PERSON>, a ministry press official, said Afghan authorities would refuse a visa to any AP correspondent, several of whom had applied to cover the withdrawal scheduled to begin Sunday. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Putzel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> chief of bureau in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, had been given oral assurances Tuesday that an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter and photographer would be given seats on the official plane carrying correspondents to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The Afghan government generally permits news coverage by Western journalists only when they are invited as members of an officially sanctioned press tour. <PERSON> Isayenko </PERSON> said that, during a news conference in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> last month, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a veteran AP <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> correspondent, asked a question that `` was very insulting'' to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> will renew its commitment to a diversified faculty under an agreement reached between the dean and about 50 students, most of them black, who staged an overnight `` study-in'' at his office. `` We feel we were very successful over the last 24 hours,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, a second-year law student who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which staged the protest. `` This is a great step forward.'' But Dean <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorenberg </PERSON> said Wednesday the administration had only agreed `` to look into'' seven of the students' 12 demands. `` I do n't think there's any major commitments on either side,'' he said. `` It's more of a sharing of understanding how issues look.'' However, <PERSON> Vorenberg </PERSON> said, a policy statement on diversity first issued in 1982 would be `` updated and reissued'' and an effort to interest minority students in teaching would be made. The students camped out at <PERSON> Vorenberg </PERSON>'s office Tuesday night in their protest for more black professors and for <PERSON> Vorenberg </PERSON>, who is retiring, to be replaced by a tenured black professor. After a meeting Wednesday, the dean `` specifically agreed to going ahead with commitments on seven'' demands, <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> said. He said the demands included establishing a fellowship to entice black professors to teach at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>; issuing a policy statement expressing a commitment to diversity as part of the school's hiring policy; and allowing students a broader role in the hiring of minority faculty. The students also failed to bring about a commitment to `` diversify the curriculum to reflect the experience of people of color'' and a request that a black assistant professor receive tenure. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> has 61 tenured positions, two of them held by blacks.

 A court today ordered a young Lebanese held in custody for eight days after police said he was the owner of a dynamite-packed car that blew up near the Israeli Embassy and killed three people. The car exploded Wednesday about 200 yards from the embassy after police prevented it from parking outside the building and the car sped off. Police said they suspected the owner, <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawillo </PERSON>, 28, of being involved in the bungled attack, which killed the driver and two bystanders. Police said the car was rigged with 300 pounds of dynamite, and Interior Minister <PERSON> Christodoulos </PERSON> <PERSON> Veniamin </PERSON> said the embassy was the intended target. Witnesses reported seeing <PERSON> Hawillo </PERSON> running from the scene, police said, adding that there was also evidence linking him to a remote-control detonating device found nearby. There was speculation that the attempt to blow up the embassy was to avenge the assassination of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s military chief. But the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> issued a statement denying involvement. Five of the 15 people hurt in the fiery blast remained hospitalized today and were listed in serious but stable condition with burns and cuts. <PERSON> Hawillo </PERSON>, who arrived from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on March 21, was brought to court under heavy security. With the hand that was n't handcuffed, he covered his face so it could not be photographed. Detective <PERSON> Takis </PERSON> <PERSON> Komodikis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hawillo </PERSON> was arrested four hours after the explosion. Police earlier reported he was picked up shortly after the blast. The judge remanded the suspect to police custody for eight days, pending the investigation's completion. A detective who spoke on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Hawillo </PERSON> had admitted to owning the car but denied any involvement in the attempt to bomb the embassy, claiming he had lent the vehicle to a friend. <PERSON> Komodikis </PERSON> told the court that the driver, who was blown to pieces, had not been identified yet. A police statement said the driver had tried to park outside the Israeli Embassy building twice before the blast, but was told to move on by police. When asked for his identification, he sped away and rammed another car at an intersection. <PERSON> Adamos </PERSON> <PERSON> Markides </PERSON>, one of the injured Cypriots, said he saw the car coming out of a side street near the embassy. `` He was driving so fast he did n't even stop at the traffic lights and hit another car,'' <PERSON> Markides </PERSON> said. He said his was the second car behind the one that exploded. `` Suddenly there was this flash and boom with a black cloud of smoke enveloping everything and a terrible heat. I staggered out of my car with my face and arms on fire.'' An anonymous caller telephoned a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> bureau of the American television network <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> to claim responsibility for the explosion in the name of the Palestinian terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> Banna </PERSON>, has been blamed for a series of terrorist attacks around the world. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy commander, was killed April 16 in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. Israeli sources have said he was killed by an Israeli squad of agents. Palestinian groups have pledged to avenge the his death. Police said the two Cypriots killed in the blast were a woman who was trapped in her burning car and a pedestrian, <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Frangos </PERSON>, a retired diplomat. The woman was not identified.

 Army helicopters rescued hundreds of civilians today from the reach of poisonous fumes after a tractor-trailer carrying bromine overturned in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, killing the driver, police said. Nine people were treated at hospitals for burns and breathing difficulties after the accident on a main highway about 65 miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahari </PERSON>, a spokesman for southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> district police. The driver, who was not identified, was pulled out of the cabin dead after police and soldiers struggled for seven hours to reach him, he said. Police closed a 72-mile stretch of road as clouds of the orange smoke billowed above the spill, witnesses said. Bromine is a poisonous, reddish-brown chemical used in making dyes and photographic solutions. `` There was a huge orange cloud of chemicals in the sky,'' one of the injured, taxi driver <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Azulai </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio. <PERSON> Azulai </PERSON> said he tried to pull the driver from the truck for about 45 minutes before being overcome by the gas and flown by helicopter to <LOCATION> Soroka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Beersheba </LOCATION>. Rescue workers also evacuated hundreds of civilians from three settlements, a school, and bedouin <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> encampments, <PERSON> Dahari </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Iraq Says It Raided Ships Off Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said today its warplanes raided two ships off <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the night, bringing to eight the number of attacks on commercial shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> it claimed in two weeks. Only one of the reported attacks has been confirmed by the London-based <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors maritime traffic around the world. Gulf-based shipping executives had no local independent information for any of the attacks since April 29. Such attacks normally would precipitate an Iranian retaliatory blow in the so-called tanker war, an offshoot of the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> said the Iraqis fired two French-made Exocet missiles at an Iranian tanker on Tuesday, causing considerable fire damage to the vessel. The vessel, whose name was not known according to <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, was owned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and was sailing from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s key oil loading terminal at <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> en route to the <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> terminal in the southern gulf. The attack took place about 40 miles off the northern Iranian coast, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> report. The <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> high command on Wednesday reported the sixth attack and today, the seventh and eighth attacks in two weeks on `` large maritime targets'' off <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The term usually means a tanker sailing to or from <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> accounts for 90 percent of Iranian oil exports and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> has vowed to block the Iranian oil flow as long as the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> rulers refuse to accept a negotiated end to their war. Ship attacks claimed by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> often are not confirmed until some time later because they occur inside the maritime war zone. Some ships maintain radio silence to avoid being targeted again. Some of the raids are never confirmed. The <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> report would be the first confirmed ship attack in the gulf since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was empowered to defend any vessel attacked by either belligerent outside exclusion zones off enemy coastlines, if a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship happened to be in the area at the time of the attack. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> retaliates for the Iraqi raids by striking at neutral commercial shipping. The Iranians have not hit any vessel since April 24 and before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rules in the gulf were broadened.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> avionics technician acquitted of assault for having sex with his former fiancee despite knowing he carried the AIDS virus said he was not surprised by the verdict. `` It was what I felt was right,'' Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said after the verdict was announced Wednesday. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, 27, was accompanied by his present fiancee, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Skavdahl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s family and friends applauded after the seven-member jury announced their verdict before Military Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollison </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jeannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s former fiancee and accuser, said she was upset by the verdict and fears it will encourage others not to reveal to sex partners that they are infected with the deadly virus. `` That's why AIDS is probably going to be carried on and on and on, because people will not tell their partner,'' said <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>. `` And now this will prove they can probably get away with it.'' <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> has tested negative for the AIDS virus three times. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> stood at attention in a packed courtroom as the jury, which deliberated 4 -LCB- hours, also acquitted him of charges of adultery and of exposing his former girlfriend to the AIDS virus wrongfully and in wanton disregard for human life. He was convicted of the minor charge of having a visitor in his room after hours, for which the jury gave him 15 days in the brig and reduced his rank by one grade, from E5 to E4. If convicted of the primary charges, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> could have been stripped of his rank, dishonorably discharged and sentenced to a 10 years behind bars. The charges stemmed from a sexual encounter <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> had on April 15, 1987. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, a native of Magnolia, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, testified he told <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> about his test results and wore a condom when the couple made love in his barracks room. He said <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>, 28, was bitter that he had broken off their brief engagement and filed the charges for revenge. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliland </PERSON>, the prosecutor, countered in her closing statement that <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> simply did n't care enough about <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> to tell her about the tests. The case was unprecedented in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, although there have been similar cases in other military branches. In <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the AIDS-related court-martial of <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> resumed after a nine-month delay. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a 28-year-old Army private from <LOCATION> Caseyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, is accused of having threatened the health of three soldiers by not using condoms during sex and failing to warn them he had tested positive for the AIDS virus. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 20 percent to 30 percent of those who test positive for exposure to the virus will develop AIDS within five years. It is not known whether everyone with the virus will eventually develop the incurable disease.

 Two Port Authority police officers were the proud owners of a slightly damaged $ 150,000 <ORGANIZATION> Rolls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royce </ORGANIZATION> _ at least until their boss found out.

<TEXT>
 Scientists who were once smuggled into this town from all over the country as part of the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project's secret attempt to build an atomic bomb in the 1940s returned openly for a reunion this week. `` We were put on trains with the shades pulled down. ... We arrived in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> at 5 a.m.,'' recalled Jeptha A. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a mechanical engineer who was one of about 60 members of the Special Engineer Detachment at the reunion. `` It was raining, everything was muddy. We were told, ` This is going to be your new home.' It was a couple of days before we knew we were in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>,'' said a chuckling <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, who returned for the first time in 42 years Sunday from <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> met his future wife, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON>, shortly after arriving at what became known as the `` Atomic City'' in January 1944 `` We were all working with a dedication. ... There was no night or day,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a chemical engineer. The work went on around the clock. After a night shift, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said, some might go to a midnight dance, others to a 2 a.m. movie. `` I have a great affection for the town _ it was a pioneer effort,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. The effort was an arm of the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project, the code name for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s effort to build atomic weapons before <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> did during World War II. Its members came from all over, and most did not know where they were going or why. `` It was n't scary, it was secret. They put the fear of God in us about telling anyone what we were doing,'' said <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, who was assigned to work on the electromagnetic separation project enriching uranium. The project, based in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, eventually yielded the two atomic bombs dropped on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1945. Oak Ridge was chosen because the government could get land for a reasonable price, there was a good labor supply, the climate allowed year-round construction and the inland location made the project safe from foreign attack. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, his wife, were married in May 1944 and got to Oak Ridge that August. He said recreation consisted largely of playing pool, listening to the radio and telling stories at the PX. `` We had fun. ... We were all relieved we helped bring World War II to an end, and we were all ready to go home,'' he said. <PERSON> Lindner </PERSON>, a mechanical engineer, said he and his wife went back to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> after the war, only to return to Oak Ridge two years later to live. `` It's exciting to reminisce and see everyone again,'' he said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hite </PERSON>, who was a design engineer, said he did n't recognize anything when he returned to <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> for the first time in 1975. `` I thought it would all shut down when the war was over,'' he said. `` We do n't need to make war anymore.''

 <PERSON> Reece </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> had a lot in common, but they'd been dating for about five months before they discovered the most important thing _ their father. Last January, when <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, 31, was looking through an inch-thick book of single women published by The Date Connection of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, he stopped on the page featuring Ms. <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>, 38. `` I liked what I saw,'' <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> said. `` She had a lot of the same interests, like traveling, dancing and going to movies.'' <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> called Ms. <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>, and they discovered they were both adopted. They began dating regularly, and did so until last week, when a private investigator hired by Ms. <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> to find her parents called. `` About two weeks ago he -LRB- the detective -RRB- called me and said my biological father's name is <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Deardorf </PERSON>,'' Ms. <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>'s biological father was also named <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Deardorf </PERSON>.

I just cried and cried and thought this just ca n't be true I mean, I had fallen in love with this man. `` But then I knew I had to tell him.'' She said shifting from a romantic relationship to a Platonic one has not been easy. `` I still love him,'' she said. `` And, he loves me. But, we have to keep telling ourselves that we're brother and sister. And that takes a lot of, well, strength.'' <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> said he too has found the transition difficult. But, he says, they've managed. `` I'm slowly getting over the shock,'' he said. `` Everyday I'm working through it Anyway, I'd rather have a sister than a girlfriend.

<TEXT>
 Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> today said ex-President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> was involved in crushing the bloody 1980 revolt in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> demanded that <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> be investigated in connection with the nine-day <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising, but said he opposes bringing him to trial. `` Mr. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> was one of those deeply involved in the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> incident,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> told reporters. `` There should be no sanctuary in our efforts to disclose all truth.'' At least 191 people were killed and more than 800 injured in the uprising, by official count. Dissidents say the toll was much higher. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> emerged as the largest opposition force in the April 26 elections for a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, previously has called for an investigation of the revolt. But tis was the first time that he named <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> as a central figure. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has said it would object to any parliamentary investigation of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his family. At the time of the uprising, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> was a general leading other military officers who seized power after a coup. Most of them later retired to take on key political posts, and <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> became president. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, then an army general, helped <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> seize power with military backing in 1980. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> did not name <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> case. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, 62, said he was arrested one day before the uprising began on May 18, 1980. A military court found <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> guilty and sentenced him to death on what he called doctored sedition charges. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s sentence was later reduced to life and then to a 20-year term. Under pressure from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> was later allowed to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for medical treatment. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said a parliamentary investigative team should look into all aspects of the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising, including the exact number of casualties, who ordered troops to open fire and any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in it. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> took the political offensive as <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government was being reorganized after last month's elections, which left the nation's governing party without a parliamentary majority for the first time in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s 40-year history <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said he `` humbly'' accepted the election setback, promised to work with the opposition and reshuffled the top security-related government posts.

<HEAD>Phones Still Out in Chicago Suburbs Five Days After Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The telephone outage in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s western suburbs dragged into a fifth day today as <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> officials tried to find out why an hour went by before firefighters arrived to fight a blaze at a switching station. Sunday's fire at the unmanned <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> station left 35,000 customers without telephone service in <LOCATION> Du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Page </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and there was no indication when they would get normal service back. Adjusting to life without telephones has been difficult, say those affected. `` You do n't miss it until you do n't have it,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>, one of more than 100 people waiting in line Wednesday for 17 phones provided free of charge outside the fire-damaged switching station. Bell learned of the fire at 3:59 p.m., when alarms at a monitoring station reported a fire and power failure, said <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>. The alarm is not designed to sound at the <ORGANIZATION> Hinsdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which arrived at the fire at 4:58 p.m.. She said an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> worker arrived at the station at 4:20 p.m., and flagged down a car and asked the driver to alert firefighters `` We're still trying to find out why there was the big difference in the time -LRB- the Bell worker -RRB- came and when the fire department came,'' Ms. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. She had little encouragement for customers. `` We do n't know when we will be able to bring back local service,'' she said Wednesday. `` And when we do, it will be a slow process of a few thousand customers a day. We ca n't estimate when. We just do n't know.'' Between 150 and 200 <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> employees have been working to restore operations, and some local calls between suburbs and some long-distance calls that normally run through the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> station were finally ringing phones, Ms. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. Cable and high-tech equipment were badly damaged by flames and the water sprayed by firefighters. The cause of the fire has not been determined, Ms. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Downers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, was standing in line for the second time to make the same business call to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The operator had cut off <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>'s first call, but under rules set up at the center, that still forced to go him back at the end of the line before another try. `` It has definitely been a headache,'' said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Telander </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Print </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, whose business publishes campground guides for travelers around the country. She said her customers calling from outside <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> get a recorded message: `` Due to mechanical difficulties, we can not complete your call. Please try again.'' `` Well, they've been trying now for three days and they're hysterical ... Why does n't the phone company just say what's going on?''

 Four of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>'s five top priests and about 30 followers were arrested today when police blocked their attempted march on the Sikh shrine which was ringed by government security forces. Among those arrested was head Sikh priest <PERSON> Jasbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rode </PERSON>. His talks Wednesday with government officials to try to end the four-day confrontation at the 400-year-old temple were inconclusive. Two Sikh militants were killed this afternoon in a heavy exchange of fire with security forces on the temple's perimeter, police said. A third was seriously injured. The deaths raised to at least 14 the number of people killed since shooting broke out Monday at the temple, <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine. Eleven others have been injured. Rode has called for the estimated 100 Sikh extremists inside the temple complex to dismantle their bunkers and for the 2,500 police and paramilitary forces ringing the shrine to withdraw. The priest and his followers were arrested at another Sikh shrine about a third of a mile north of the <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Temple </LOCATION> as they were about to start marching in defiance of a police ban. Deputy Police Commissioner <PERSON> Sarbjeet </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> asked the group to call off the march because two bursts of gunfire inside the temple were reported this morning after an overnight lull. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> Police Chief K.P.S. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> told a news conference that there were no plans to end the siege. Asked where it was leading, <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said: `` We are waiting to see how the situation develops.'' `` We want the militants to stop firing so that normalcy can be restored,'' he added. `` We take responsibility for any firing from inside the temple,'' Rode responded. `` You take responsibility for firing from outside.'' Sikh militants placed a medium-sized machine gun atop a tower inside the complex and were in a position to fire down on anyone in the area. The Sikhs have also built fortifications on the northern edge of the complex, from which police Tuesday evacuated 800 pilgrims to keep them out of the crossfire. All shops and businesses in the old, walled sector of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> which surrounds the temple remained shuttered today and people stayed off the streets as a police-imposed curfew entered its fourth day. State-run <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the government was trying to ensure that milk and other supplies reach civilians in curfew-bound areas. Police had hoped to lift the curfew Wednesday, but the effort failed. The temple complex covers an area equivalent to more than five city blocks, and includes offices, hostels and dining halls. The Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus. Sikh militants have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1983 for more autonomy for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. Sikhs make up less than two percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people and <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> is the only state where they are a majority. More than 940 people have been killed this year in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> in attacks blamed on the extremists. Most have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs opposed to the separatist campaign. The Indian army was sent into the Golden Temple complex in June 1984 to drive Sikh extremists from the shrine. More than 1,200 people were killed in the attack, including <PERSON> Jarnail </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhindranwale </PERSON>, a militant Sikh preacher. Later that year, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards in revenge.

 A search was continuing today for three Marines missing and feared dead after their helicopter crashed into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> during a flight to check maintenance work on its rotor blades, officials said. The CH-46 Sea Knight from <ORGANIZATION> Kaneohe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> crashed Wednesday into water about 30 feet deep a mile off the island of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>, said Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Three helicopters searched unsuccessfully for the crew until sunset, with the search continuing at night with a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter. An air search was scheduled to resume again at dawn, he said. Marine divers located wreckage on the sea bed, but were unable to find the helicopter's crew, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said repair crews had removed the helicopter's rotor blades and reinstalled them during routine maintenance. He said the crew had taken the chopper out for a test flight to make sure the blades were in balance. `` It started falling and I saw something fall off of it _ maybe it was the tail part that fell,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kam </PERSON>, who saw the crash through a window. <PERSON> Kam </PERSON>, a newscaster at radio station <ORGANIZATION> KRTR </ORGANIZATION>, said the craft was smoking as it fell to the water. The helicopter was attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 262 </ORGANIZATION>, one of five squadrons based at <LOCATION> Kaneohe </LOCATION>. The CH-46 has been out of production since 1971, after orders declined with the end of the Vietnam War, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torgerson </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. It has been used by the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> since the early 1960s as a troop transport aircraft, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has also used it to airlift supplies, <PERSON> Torgerson </PERSON> said. Since discontinuing production, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has made kits to maintain the reliability of the helicopter and extend its life into the 1990s, he said. <PERSON> Torgerson </PERSON> said there has been no history of mechanical problems with the CH-46, although `` all aircraft that operate for that long have had some incidents.''

 Not once in the 13 harrowing minutes it took the crew of <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight 243 to land the severly damaged plane did co-pilot <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> `` Mimi'' <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> doubt she and pilot <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON> would keep control of the craft, she said today. `` I did n't feel nervous,'' even though the crew saw sky through the cockpit doorway, had one engine out and communicated with hand signals because of the noise, Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON> said he struggled to fly the plane by `` feel,'' unaware that a 20-foot chunk of cabin ceiling had been shorn off the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, sweeping a stewardess to her death. `` Our whole emphasis was focused on feeling it, that it was flyable, and being able to land it safely,'' he said in the interview. The dramatic tape of the conversation between the crew and the air traffic control tower at <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>, released Wednesday, shows Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>' voice was strained but under control as the troubles began on April 28. `` We have rapid decompression. We are unpressurized _ declaring an emergency,'' she told the tower. Schornstheimer described the moment the roof was ripped away: `` All of a sudden there was this loud thump sound and debris was flying everywhere in the cockpit. I turned around and looked out the door and everything above shoulder level was blue sky. `` The cockpit door was blown off,'' he said. `` I did n't really know how far the damage went, all I could see was blue sky.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> said `` training and experience'' took over as the plane shook in the air and debris flew through the cockpit. `` We just immediately started into the things we're trained for, getting on our oxygen masks and started down and making a decision about where we wanted to land,'' said <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> and I are both experienced even though we have n't flown that much together. We just pointed and we both knew where we were going and what we were doing and continued on with our normal procedures,'' he said. The plane shook violently when the pilot dipped below a certain speed, and the problems multiplied as the plane descended. `` Somewhere along that line we lost an engine, and we started our auxiliary power unit and used the generator on it for part of the electrical power on the airplane,'' said <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON>. Adding to his concerns, <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON> said in an interview published in today's editions of <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today, was the fact that, when he looked through the open doorway into the main cabin, enough pieces of flooring had been ripped up that the craft's control cables were exposed. Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>, meanwhile, spoke coolly with the controllers as the plane dipped below 11,000 feet and was cleared for a head-on approach to the runway. `` We're going to need assistance. We can not communicate with the flight attendants. Ah, will -LRB- there -RRB- be assistance for the passengers when we land?'' Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> asked the air traffic control tower. <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON> said after their initial shock on seeing the plane after landing, he and Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> went on helping passengers in the rescue operation. `` It did -LRB- fly -RRB-. We were glad it hung together,'' he said. `` It was just amazing to walk around the airplane after we landed and look at it.'' Hours before a tape of the radio transmissions was made public Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the two pilots received an award from the Air Line Pilots Association for landing the crippled plane with all passengers and all but the one stewardess safe. Earlier in the week, Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON> had met with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and made the rounds at offices in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. They declined to discuss the incident with reporters. `` What seemed like a short time to <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> and me because of our busy cockpit duties must have seemed like an eternity to our passengers and flight attendants,'' Schornstheimer told fellow pilots Wednesday while accepting the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> award. His co-pilot, Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>, praised the captain: `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> analyzed the situation confronting us and he reacted. All of his decisions were the right ones.'' The two pilots said their ability to work as a team under adverse conditions was key to bringing the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 to a safe landing. As bad as Flight 243's situation was, the tape showed that the two pilots thought _ erroneously, it turned out _ that it was even worse. According to the tape, the pilots were certain that for some reason the nose landing gear was not deploying. This would have made landing the already severely damaged aircraft especially dangerous, according to aviation experts. `` Be advised we have no nose gear we are landing without a nose gear,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> airport tower in a strained but controlled voice as the plane headed toward the airport. `` We'll need all the -LRB- emergency -RRB- equipment you got. It is believed that a malfunctioning indicator light misled the pilots into thinking the nose gear had not deployed. Only seconds before the plane set down on the runway did the controller see that the nose gear actually had deployed and advised the flight crew. Then the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 landed, ambulances and fire trucks waiting. Despite the experience, Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> gathering Wednesday that she is ready to get back to the cockpit. `` I ` m looking forward to going back to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and flying again,'' she said.

 A painting of the late mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> wearing women's lingerie was impounded by police after the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> condemned the work and aldermen stormed the prestigious art school where it was displayed. Students yelled `` Fascists!'' and `` <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is a communist state!'' after nine alderman removed the caricature of the city's first black mayor, who died of a heart attack in November, from the School of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> `` Half the city is still mourning,'' said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>. `` You're going to tell me it's art?'' The City Council contingent charged the work was racist and an insult to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> family. `` The painting has been arrested,'' <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. The portrait, wrapped in brown paper, was carried off in a squad car that left the school with sirens wailing. Students at the school, a four-year college affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, argued that the work was artistic self-expression and protected by the First Amendment. `` This has nothing to do with race, it has to do with art,'' said student <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Landers </PERSON>. `` Do n't tell us what to draw.'' The painting depicted <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> clad in a frilly white bra, panties and stockings, holding a pencil and frowning at viewers. It was displayed in a school hallway with dozens of others in a student competition closed to the public. The students repeatedly restored the painting to the wall after aldermen took it down. The aldermen eventually took the work to school president <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who agreed to allow police to impound the work. `` We got complaints about the painting. We came down here and ... found it insulting, inciting and causing unrest,'' <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who signed a statement at the aldermen's request indicating the work would not be displayed again at the school, later said police were concerned the painting `` would lead to riots.'' `` ` Incitement to riot' was the phrase they actually used,'' he said. Artist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> left the school hours before the confrontation, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, adding he had tried unsuccessfully to reach the student to seek voluntary removal of the painting before the City Hall delegation arrived. A school statement said the artist `` chose this work himself'' and noted, `` Students bear the sole responsibility for selection of their work in this exhibition.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> could not be reached to explain what the painting was intended to represent. School spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frech </PERSON> would not provide his telephone number, and calls placed to listed telephone numbers for that name went unanswered or were answered by people who denied any knowledge of the painting. The exhibit also included a self-portrait of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, showing a young white man embracing people of various races and titled, `` I'm sensitive and I love all humanity. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution Wednesday calling for withdrawal of city subsidies to the school unless the painting was removed, and demanding a public apology.

<HEAD>Opposition Parties To Call Non-Confidence Vote Against Minister</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Opposition parties today agreed to call a no-confidence vote in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> against a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister who claimed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was not an aggressor in World War II. A resolution condemning <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Seisuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON> was expected to be submitted to the Lower House of the Diet on Friday, said an official of the opposition Komeito -LRB- Clean Government Party -RRB-. But the measure was almost certain to fail because the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has a 302-seat majority in the 512-seat Lower House. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>'s comments and previous lapses by other officials have `` severely damaged'' relations with Asian nations. <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON> came under fire from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for an April 22 statement that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was not an aggressor in World War II and `` fought to protect itself at a time when the white race had turned <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> into a colony.'' He made the remark after visiting <LOCATION> Yasukuni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shrine </LOCATION>, where war heroes and convicted war criminals are enshrined. Other countries, including <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, have protested official visits to the monument in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON> said the objections were `` unfortunate.'' In separate policy committee meetings, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Komeito </ORGANIZATION> agreed to call a no-confidence vote against the 75-year-old minister, said the <ORGANIZATION> Komeito </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s two largest opposition groupings were supported by the Democratic Socialists and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. News reports said the opposition was privately pressing Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to dismiss <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>, widely regarded as the third-highest ranking official after <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>'s comments and his refusal to apologize have embarrassed the government. Spokesmen have stressed that his views do not reflect official policy. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, fielding questions from opposition Diet members Wednesday, said: `` Our country feels deep responsibility for the grave damage <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> inflicted on the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people during the past war. We believe the government should fully recognize that our country's actions during the war have been criticized severely as aggression.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who tried to soothe <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s anger on a trip to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last week, said today he had telephoned <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON> and urged him to withdraw his comments. Today, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> termed the comments `` an expression of a sinister intention to open a chapter of a new history of militarist aggression.'' Beginning in 1937, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> fought an eight-year war that killed 571,000 Japanese and 1.3 million Chinese soldiers and an untold number of civilians. The dead included an estimated 42,000 Chinese civilians and captured soldiers killed by the Japanese in the <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> massacre in the winter of 1937-38. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> signed a treaty in 1972 that says in part, `` The Japanese side is keenly aware of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s responsibility for causing enormous damages in the past to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people through war and deeply reproaches itself.''

 Seven members of a leftist terrorist group linked to two bloody Brink's armored truck robberies in 1981 face new charges of setting off bombs at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol and three military facilities. The charges were made public here Wednesday just hours after one of the defendants, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, was convicted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> of murder and armed robbery in two 1981 Brink's truck holdups that left four dead. Ms. <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehorn </PERSON> were charged with conspiring to wage a campaign of `` armed propaganda'' against `` imperialist rule'' by setting off bombs in the Capitol and seven other locations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunk </PERSON>, Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> were named as participants but not charged with conspiracy. All seven were charged with malicious damage of government property by placing bombs in the Capitol and at three military buildings here.

After the Capitol bombing, the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> sent a communique to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> saying it set off the bomb to protest the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and the deployment of Marines in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We purposely aimed our attack at the institutions of imperialist rule rather than at individual members of the ruling class and government,'' the communique said. `` We did not choose to kill any of them at this time. But their lives are not sacred.'' The various groups also claimed responsibility for bombs set off at four buildings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at: _ The Federal Building in <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Jan. 18, 1983 _ The <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> on April 5, 1984 _ The South African Consulate on Sept. 26, 1984 _ The <ORGANIZATION> Patrolmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 23, 1985 Documents seized by federal agents indicated that the group also targeted the Old Executive Office Building next to the White House, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

 After six days of fighting, guns fell silent in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s slums today as rival Shiite Moslem militias observed a cease-fire arranged by the presidents of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Police said the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, controlled 70 percent of the 16-square-mile slums before the cease-fire went into effect at 11 p.m. -LRB- 5 p.m. EDT -RRB- Wednesday. Tension remained high in the slums as both sides, armed in their positions, exchanged occasional sniper and machine-gun fire. One woman was killed by a sniper's bullet in the <LOCATION> Ghobeiri </LOCATION> district today. Police said 33 people were killed and 160 wounded Wednesday before the truce began. The overall toll from nearly a week of violence was 188 killed and 532 wounded. A police spokesman said the Syrian-backed Amal, Arabic for hope, had lost most of its positions in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s narrow alleys and redeployed its militiamen along the disputed terrain's southern, western and northern edges. `` Amal controls all the gateways to south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> controls most of the area from inside,'' said the spokesman, who by regulation can not be identified. Reporters who toured the embattled slums saw Amal militiamen at those positions in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters, in light green fatigues and green headbands, controlled most of the area from inside. Bullet scars appeared on nearly every building in the area. Smoke billowed from several shell-pocked apartment blocks and shops that were hit during Wednesday's battles. Several Amal jeeps were seen destroyed along the side roads of districts under <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s control. Dozens of cars were damaged. Several others were burned beyond recognition. Glass shards and rubble littered the dusty streets and alleys of the embattled slums. Iranian flags rose from at least 15 Amal positions overrun by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. The `` final cease-fire'' was ordered by President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and his Iranian counterpart, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, after telephone consultations late Wednesday evening. The two presidents also set up a four-man committee to supervise implementation of the accord. The committee groups <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheikholeslam </PERSON>; the head of Syrian military intelligence in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON>; <PERSON> Ayoub </PERSON> <PERSON> Homeyed </PERSON> of Amal; and <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Four observer teams formed by the committee entered south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> early today to supervise evacuation of the wounded from both rival factions, the police spokesman said. He said a convoy of about 10 ambulances from the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> also drove across Amal lines into the bomb-scarred slums to evacuate the wounded. However, the evacuation was delayed because `` at the last minute <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> demanded guarantees that its wounded will be safe in hospitals of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> outside its area of influence,'' the spokesman said. He said `` the Syrians agreed to guarantee safety of wounded Hezbollahis.'' At the height of the fighting, doctors said militiamen forced surgeons at a hospital to operate at gunpoint, and that there were gunbattles inside the hospital. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> deployed 7,500 troops in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> 14 months ago after a month of bloody clashes between Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s Amal and the militia of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Syrians, however, did not deploy in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a traditional stronghold for Iranian-backed underground factions holding most of the 18 foreign hostages. The truce was reached after <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> lost most of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the pro-Iranian radicals. The truce calls for withdrawal of all militiamen from the streets of the southern suburbs this afternoon. `` The withdrawal will be the big test,'' the police spokesman said. Four previous cease-fire accords have collapsed due to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to withdraw to positions it held before the confrontation broke out Friday. An Amal official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his militia `` insists on returning to the districts we controlled before the clashes started.'' He refused to say whether <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> would try to regain its lost positions by force if <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> refuses to withdraw.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call to white Democratic legislators who benefited from black votes to back him for the presidential nomination has failed to attract much support from those who count at the national convention. Since the days leading up to the Super Tuesday primaries on March 8, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ha said that white Democratic legislators, especially those in the South who were elected with a major share of the black vote, should be willing to support him based on that basis. He recently renewed that call and added a new twist _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> named names. `` It's reasonable to expect that Sen. -LRB- <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> will endorse my campaign. That's a reasonable expectation,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said during an appearance in <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sanford </LOCATION>, who was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, is one of the unpledged public officeholders who will attend the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> as a `` super delegate.'' Earlier in the campaign, <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> backed <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who captured <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Super Tuesday. In the wake of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s decision to suspend his campaign, <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> moved into the uncommitted ranks. `` He wants to enjoy his uncommitted status for a little bit,'' said <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> chose not to comment on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for his support, <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> said. Back in 1986, when <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> sought the Democratic nomination for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, he did not have the backing of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>, a black candidate seeking the Democratic nod, picked up <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s endorsement instead. <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> `` was not a serious candidate by any stretch of the imagination,'' said <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>. In the general election, <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> edged <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broyhill </PERSON>, 52 percent to 48 percent, with a major share of the black vote and nearly half of the white vote _ about 45 percent. `` By the early'70s, the late'60s, the percentage of white votes began dropping precipitously,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. `` Democrats do n't need a majority -LRB- to win the election -RRB- thanks to the black vote, but they need a healthy slice of the white vote.'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> says that in the South the white vote has become the swing vote. `` The Achilles heel for Republicans is they get little support from blacks so they have to get a landslide of whites. The Republicans need a landslide to make it close,'' he said. The ability to capture a large share of the white swing vote, combined with strong black support, made the difference for a number of Southern senators elected in 1986. Wyche <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> has been elected for nine years to represent the black majority fifth congressional district in his state. In the general election, <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> won his old district by nearly a 2-to-1 margin but he also won the support of 4-out-of-10 white voters. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, who also is a super delegate, remains uncommitted. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Senator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> did well in the Cajun parishes but also carried or finished even in the white Baptist parishes for his 1986 victory. <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> also remains uncommitted. Not only did these candidates target the white swing vote, but they had to battle the staunch white voters who refuse to support a candidate who has the backing of black voters, according to pollster <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` It's hard to document but about one-fifth of the typically Democratic voters will not back a candidate with black voters,'' Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` Democrats are caught perenially between a rock and a hard place.'' Some of these Southern senators who managed to capture both the black vote and a large enough share of the white vote have decided not to endorse a presidential candidate before the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, July 18-21. In fact, 11 of the 12 Southern senators who will be attending the convention as super delegates have chosen the uncommitted ranks. Only <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> remains steadfast in his support of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has also hinted that his supporters might stay away from the polls in November if they perceived that he was being treated unfairly. `` We define our friends by their willingness to be fair and to be just,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` One thing about politics, it does not go up and down. It goes round and round. Anything that goes around comes around.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s indication of possible party problems in the general election presents a real dilemma for Democrats, who are treading carefully on the issue. `` If <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is not treated well, there could be a low turnout for the ticket,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. `` If it's not as high, they need a larger share of the white vote.''

 Big Bird and scads of preschoolers are delighted and Oscar the grouch is predictably unimpressed. Perhaps the only ones nervous about Friday's `` wedding'' of <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> are the creators of `` Sesame Street.'' The marriage of two of the show's longtime characters represents the first attempt by the public television program, now in its 19th season, to show how romantic love works. <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovelace </PERSON>, the show's director of research, said the staff found `` no books for preschoolers on love and marriage, only death and divorce.'' When interviews with 90 <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> preschoolers showed that young children did not make the connection between love and marriage, the general outline of the theme was born. `` We wanted the wedding to make that connection for them,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lovelace </PERSON>. The message has been carefully cultivated since last December, when <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON>, longtime friends and partners in the show's Fix-It Shop, realized that their feelings were changing as they cared for a sick kitten together `` I saw them kiss,'' said <PERSON> Vicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasquez </PERSON>, a 4-year-old on a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> playground full of chatter about the impending match. `` So I know they're happy.'' `` We thought, ` What could we say to 3-year-olds about love?''' said <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzano </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and writes for the show. `` And since kids see love in terms of physical things like kissing, hugging, giving flowers, we showed <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> doing a lot of that.'' <PERSON> Dulcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, executive producer, said Ms. <PERSON> Manzano </PERSON>, who was married two years ago, inspired the wedding when she told her she was thinking about having a baby. The show was actually taped last January. Ms. <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> declined to say whether <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON>, who is played by <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON>, would have a child after the wedding.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Claim They Forced Vietnamese Into Interior</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Cambodian guerrillas say they have broken <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s control of thousands of villages in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, forcing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to send soldiers to defend the villages. The claim came in a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> radio broadcast in which guerrilla Commander-in-Chief Son Sen reported on fighting from October 1987 to April 1988, the region's dry season. A text of the broadcast was obtained today. The communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, with about 30,000 guerrillas, is the strongest of three groups opposing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 9-year-old occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> claims are widely regarded as exaggerated. In the broadcast, a text of which was obtained today, the guerrillas claimed they killed 11,200 Vietnamese soldiers and `` repeatedly attacked and dismantled or dispersed the Vietnamese administrative networks in 4,033 villages and 236 communes and attacked 23 townships and seven district towns.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> responded by transferring an important part of its troops from the western battlefields bordering <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> _ the traditional area of fighting _ to the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, the broadcast said. That allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who are based along the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border, to infiltrate more men into the interior, it said. `` Therefore, the Vietnamese enemy's strategy to seal off the western border of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and prevent the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- from attacking it inside <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> suffered a total setback,'' the broadcast said. A coalition of three <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> groups is fighting to drive out the Vietnamese, who invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1979 to drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed hundreds of thousands of people during their 1975-79 reign of terror. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had assisted the <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> side against the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> during the 1973-75 civil war.

 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> today detonated its first underground nuclear bomb this year in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> protested the explosion and said it could not have happened at a worse time. The 50-kiloton device, equivalent to 50,000 tons of dynamite, went off at 5 a.m. at a nuclear test site on the French-controlled <PERSON> Mururua </PERSON> <PERSON> Atoll </PERSON>, about one-third of the way between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and the Central American coast. The explosion was the 92nd underground test there since <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> abandoned atmospheric testing in 1975, said to <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zealand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> government will keep expressing its strong concern about <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> nuclear testing whenever it occurs,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> Foreign Mnister <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. `` The timing could not be worse.'' The testing has strained <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s relations with countries of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, which have declared the region a nuclear-free zone.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon has `` serious deficiencies'' in the way it manages the safety of its research programs into chemical and biological warfare, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee's staff report maintains. The review found `` inadequate regulations, lax safety enforcement and documented safety lapses,'' said the report by the majority staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Governmental Affairs oversight subcommittee. The study, released Wednesday, noted that it did not examine `` the current safety practices of particular facilities conducting ... research. Nor does it reach final conclusions as to whether ... research is being conducted in a safe manner.'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morger </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said today that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials had n't seen the report. `` We need to look at it carefully, but we're greatly concerned when there are questions from any corner about possible safety issues in programs overseen by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recently began building new chemical weapons, after halting the program in 1969. The nation produces no germ weapons and has unilaterally renounced the use of biological weapons, but does conduct research into chemical weapons that might be used against American troops. Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, said he plans to hold hearings later this year to discuss the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s safety practices in the two research The study noted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spending on the programs has increased sharply during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s two terms, from about $ 63 million in 1980 to $ 348 million in 1986. The number of laboratories involved in research has also increased, the study found. There are about 150 labs doing Pentagon-sponsored research in chemical and germ weapons. The subcommittee staff said it was `` unable to locate a comprehensive safety program ..., that is, a readily identifiable set of safety regulations and an office with overall safety responsibilities. In the biological weapons area, the review found that `` there is no comprehensive set of safety regulations for research'' with biological warfare agents and toxins, `` no emphasis on safety in the contractor program and no office that monitors contractor safety.'' For chemical weapons, the approach is better, although it also `` appears to have major shortcomings,'' the study said. The military has a wide number of safety steps, but many are violated, the study said.

Since then, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who was one of the creators of his nation's hydrogen bomb, has vocally supported Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform campaign, but has called for the liberation of all political prisoners and more improvements in the field of human rights. Past Soviet reports, published before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became Soviet leader, accused <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> of marrying <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> for his money and said the couple lived in `` oriental luxury'' amid `` scandals between spouses.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News depicted the couple as living peacefully and frugally, eating cabbage, beet soup, potatoes, and other simple fare, and marveled that <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, a member of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, always does the dishes himself. While <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was in exile in the closed city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>, the author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. `` <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> put a copy of his book in front of him and proposed that he write an apology for all the lies that were published,'' the paper said. It reported that when the unidentified author refused, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said, `` It's too bad that duels are abolished in our times,'' and slapped him. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has been quoted numerous times by Soviet media since his return from exile, but the article in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News was the longest devoted to him so far. But most of the newspaper's circulation is among foreign tourists and readers abroad, so relatively few Soviets would see the <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> article. As well as appearing in Russian, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News also prints editions in English, French and other languages.

Ms. <PERSON> Niles </PERSON> said she left the classroom April 22 where <PERSON> Felton </PERSON> was with two other students to go to the bathroom and returned five minutes later. She said she had a glass of iced tea near her desk that was about a quarter full. `` I just took a big gulp,'' she said. `` I realized it was bitter. It felt like my mouth was on fire.

<HEAD>Exhaustion May Have Figured in Fatal Train Crash, Expert Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Train crewmen involved in a fiery <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> crash suffered from lack of sleep and could have unwittingly dozed off while still performing basic duties, an expert on work schedules said today. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tepas </PERSON>, an industrial psychologist from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION>, reviewed the six men's hours for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigation into the Jan. 14 accident. Two <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> trains, one hauling coal and the other hauling trailer-vans, smashed head-on at <LOCATION> Thompsontown </LOCATION>, killing the engineer and the brakeman on both trains and derailing all five locomotives. Damage was estimated at $ 5 million. `` After examining the work schedules of the crew members involved in the Thompsontown accident, I'm quite comfortable in concluding that many or all of the crew members involved were suffering from chronic sleep deprivation,'' <PERSON> Tepas </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> hearing today. `` A normal manifestation of this state is brief or extended periods of sleep, some of which workers themselves may not be aware of.'' During such periods, he said, people can react to signals presented to them. The industrial psychologist blamed erratic work schedules; harsh, monotonous work environments, and a failure to instruct workers in dealing with fatigue. `` Given current approaches to rail operations and the use of human resources, there is little doubt in my mind that rail crews often fall asleep on the job,'' he said. During the opening day of testimony Wednesday, neither of the two survivors said they received any warning before the head-on collision or saw or heard the other train approaching. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, conductor on the train carrying the trailer-vans, testified the accident occurred when a dispatcher switched his train to another track before receiving a signal that the coal train had stopped. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, a 35-year <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> veteran, said there are no strict rules for the dispatcher to go by. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nearhoof </PERSON>, the dispatcher, testified that he had perceived no indication that one of the trains had gone through a stop signal. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haselbarth </PERSON>, 33, the conductor of the coal train, said he received a report from <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Police </LOCATION> on the day of the wreck that the train's rear brakes were sticking. He then stopped the train and corrected the situation. Shortly before the accident, <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> said he felt the train decelerate rapidly, but he does not remember anyone applying the emergency brakes. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> said he then saw the brakeman on his train, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSantis </PERSON>, fall from the lead locomotive. `` I knew something was wrong,'' he said. `` It all happened so fast, it did n't register that we were hitting anyone. I thought everything was caving in. I was just holding on.'' Toxicology tests showed a small amount of marijuana present in <LOCATION> Haselbarth </LOCATION>'s urine, but he testified he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the crash. Throughout the hearing, questions arose on the amount of sleep rail workers get before they must report for duty. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> reported that he had had about 4 -LCB- hours of sleep before beginning his shift on the day of the accident. <PERSON> Haselbarth </PERSON> said he thought he had slept for just one or two hours the night before he reported to work for the fatal run, but added he felt rested from the previous night's sleep. `` The railroad has complete, 100 percent control of your life. You do n't,'' he said.

Denials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of public interest lawyers say they are alarmed that only one-quarter of the illegal aliens whose amnesty applications have been denied are filing appeals. Many of the rejected applicants may be confused by the letters of denial from the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, attorney <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` These denial letters are three pages, all in English,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Alva </PERSON>, an attorney with the Public Counsel, an organization financed by the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> bar associations. `` For many immigrants, they're just about impossible to understand.'' But <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> regional processing facility in <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, said many of those denied amnesty under the 1986 immigration reform act may be choosing not to appeal because they realize they will not succeed. The deadline for seeking amnesty was midnight May 4. Many denials were issued because applicants were ineligible, disqualified by criminal records or because of fraudulent applications, he said. To qualify, illegal aliens had to prove that they had lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continuously beginning Jan. 1, 1982. As of May 7, 4,047 denials had been sent to amnesty applicants in the agency's Western region, which includes <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>. Of those, 1,001 have appealed. Those rejected have just 30 days to appeal, a process that costs $ 50. Federal officials argued the applicants were able to fill out English applications and should be able to deal with denial letters in English. `` They've been treated fairly,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of immigration reform for the Western region. `` If they -LRB- amnesty applicants -RRB- have a problem with interpretation of their denials, they can get help from the same people who helped them file their applications,'' he said.

 Police said today American actor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> was clubbed to death by his 18-year-old adopted son and three other men this month and that cocaine was found on his body. Police spokesman Col. <PERSON> Aquiles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> said at a news conference that the four men were charged with murder in the 68-year-old <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s death. He presented three of them to reporters and said the fourth had not been arrested. <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> did not say how much of the drug was found on <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s body. The three suspects told reporters they had killed <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who was found dead in his car May 5. A pathologists' report released Monday said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> had died accidentally of head injuries suffered when his speeding car ran off a road near the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION> Sosua </LOCATION> and fell into a ditch, flipping over several times. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a British-born <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen who won two <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> awards, owned a beach home just outside <LOCATION> Sosua </LOCATION>, about 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION>. There was no immediate comment on the discrepancy between the autopsy finding and the police report, but the pathologists scheduled a news conference for later in the day. <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> identified <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s adopted son as <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralfe </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON>, nicknamed `` Juan.'' Also charged was the young man's natural father, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, and another relative, <PERSON> Maximo </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> He did not identify the fourth man. The autopsy was conducted after <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> asked police to investigate the actor's death. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> won <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> awards for his Broadway roles in `` The Mystery of <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Drood </PERSON>'' and `` My Fair Lady.'' He was a versatile actor who was as much at home playing <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> as he was in a comedy or a musical. He preferred the stage, but also appeared in scores of film and television productions. Rose had lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> since 1961.

<TEXT>
 Five people trying to cash in on gold fever were arrested today on charges of running a treasure-hunting scam that fleeced $ 1.7 million from 700 investors, state officials said. `` This was a treasure salvage company, but the only treasure found was the money that was taken from the pockets of investors,'' said state Comptroller <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. He announced the arrests at a joint news conference with Statewide Proscutor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonacci </PERSON> and Commissioner <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>, whose offices helped in the probe. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the three agencies also are investigating as many as 15 other treasure-hunting operations seeking investors with `` treasure fever.'' Most of the operations are in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but a few are out of state. Most of those under investigation have been trading on the success of treasure hunter <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, whose find of the Spanish galleon <PERSON> Nuestra </PERSON> <PERSON> Senora </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Atocha </PERSON> was worth hundreds of millions of dollars. `` In this case, the people bought a ship from <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> and they bought apparently a small amount of treasure so they could show this and use it and use <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s name,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. Arrested and charged with multiple counts of fraud, securities fraud, sale of unregistered securities and racketeering were <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Deltona </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Durant </PERSON>, 69, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 41, and his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 64, also of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. They were indicted May 5 by a grand jury. The indictment states the alleged scam involved <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tesoro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Tesoro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the operators claimed they found three wrecks and that treasure would be sold to a museum in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, none of which was true At its very best, treasure-hunting is a risky business, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. He pointed out that it took <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> years to find his fortune, and his son and daughter-in-law were killed during the effort. `` Frankly, in my opinion, if a person wants to do this they'd be better off getting a boat, going out in the water, taking their money -LRB- and -RRB- throwing it overboard,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` They're as likely to have that turn into treasure, pop back up to the surface, as they are investing in one of these bogus operations,'' he said. `` And they'll come out actually a little bit better because they would have had a nice boat ride in the process.''

 A geology professor demonstrating an instrument for measuring radioactivity to a high school class accidentally found a long-abandoned canister containing radium, officials said.

The canister was discovered Tuesday when geologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, who had shown a science class how a Geiger counter reacted to uranium rocks and put the instrument against the classroom wall to show normal readings. Instead of remaining silent, the device went off. Behind the wall was a storeroom where officials found a canister marked `` <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>'' and dated 1944. The canister had apparently been on a shelf since the school opened in 1965, <ORGANIZATION> Watauga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> said. It was bought along with three boxes of other scientific instruments more than 20 years ago by a teacher, he said. The device, which contained a small amount of radium, was used for checking the moisture in soil; state radiation experts said it was probably used before building roads. A team of physicists from the state examined the device, <PERSON> Warlick </PERSON> said. It was to be analyzed later this week to determine how to dispose of it. <PERSON> Warlick </PERSON> said his office received numerous telephone calls Wednesday from news media representatives who heard rumors that a nuclear accident had occurred.

 Americans have become more casual about cholesterol and good nutrition in general, according to a Prevention magazine survey issued today that shows a decline in health practices for the first time in five years. `` We do n't know whether this year's score represents a temporary setback on the way to further progress or whether it is an early warning sign,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dybdahl </PERSON>, director of the private publication's so-called prevention index. The 1988 score is 64.8 out of a possible 100 _ down from 65.2 last year, but still 3.3 points above 1984, when the first index was compiled. The latest sampling found that more Americans are using smoke detectors and getting strenuous exercise, but falling behind in the area of good nutrition. For example, the number saying they are making efforts to limit high-cholesterol foods fell from 46 percent in the 1987 report to 42 percent and there also was a four-point decline in the number who said they make an effort to get adequate vitamins and minerals _ from 63 percent to 59 percent. `` One clear message from this year's survey is that the spread of good health habits is not automatic,'' <PERSON> Dybdahl </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` People may know more than ever about good health, but they may not be acting on what they know. In key areas such as diet, exercise and weight control, there is still much room for improvement.'' Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, director of the federal government's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION>, said the survey is the only one to track the same data over a five-year period The sharpest gains from the 1984 report were the 57 percent who reported wearing seat belts now compared with 19 percent then and the 82 percent who say they have a smoke detector in their home compared with 67 percent then. The biggest drop was in those who said they obey the speed limit _ from 61 percent in 1984 to 55 percent. The <LOCATION> Emmaus </LOCATION>, Pa.-based magazine has retained <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> for the past five years to poll Americans on their practices in 21 health-related areas ranging from not smoking to exercising to using a smoke detector in the home and wearing auto seat belts. The same questions have been asked each year to give an accurate year-to-year comparison and relative weights assigned to each of the 21 areas. For example, not smoking is assigned the highest ranking _ a 9.78 on a scale of one-to-10. The current year's report was based on telephone interviews conducted with 1,250 randomly selected adults Nov. 11-25. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged the survey's 3 percent margin of error could call into question year-to-year changes that are within that margin. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said, however, that the theoretical chance for error is largely overriden because consistent trends tracked over the five-year sampling period give added credence to the figures reported in any one year.

 A fire that gutted the top floor of the building where the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION> was signed in 1803 was apparently touched off by workers doing repair work, a fire official said today. Wednesday's fire, which raged out of control for two hours, destroyed or damaged priceless artifacts and threatened the nation's oldest Roman Catholic cathedral next door. The blaze destroyed 18th century French furniture stored in the upper floor and consumed the cupola atop the three-story Cabildo, a Spanish-style gray stucco building with a slate roof, officials said. No injuries were reported. Fire Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrossen </PERSON> said today that workers repairing the roof and waterproofing the stucco walls apparently touched off the fire. `` We think it's tied up to the restoration,'' he said. There was speculation that a soldering iron, used in repairing metal flashing, touched off timbers that originally came down the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as flatboats. The mansard roof and the top floor were added in 1847 using timbers salvaged from the river barges. `` There's all the cultural heritage of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> in that building. It makes me want to cry,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sefcik </PERSON>, museum director of the 193-year-old landmark in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' French Quarter. Smoke and water stained and soaked contents of the first and second floors, where paintings, tapestries, doll and fan collections, <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> memorabilia, pottery and other items were on display, officials said. `` Next to Independence Hall in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, this is the most historic building in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> architect who renovated the Cabildo's interior 20 years ago. The cause of the fire remained uncertain, but <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the building remained structurally sound and could be repaired. An estimate of damages was not immediately available. The building alone was assessed at $ 50 million and is insured, said <PERSON> Sefcik </PERSON>. `` Every painting, every artifact suffered some water or smoke damage,'' <PERSON> Sefcik </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION> inside the three-story building in 1803. It also was the repository for a death mask of <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> and other priceless antiques and artifacts. The bronze death mask was saved.

 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> today said it was shocked at what <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s decision to cancel a meeting between Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and an opposition political group next week. The chief <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, said the action announced Wednesday by Paraguayan President Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s longest-ruling military chief, hindered `` the exercise of the pastoral mission of the Holy Father.'' <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> cited grounds of security for canceling the meeting, scheduled for Tuesday in the Paraguayan capital of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>. He also charged the group would use a religious encounter for political ends. The group, called <ORGANIZATION> Constructors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, has about 350 members and includes politicians, peasant farmers, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> laymen and lawyers. It was the first time in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s 37 trips abroad that a foreign statesman interfered with his schedule. But the church in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> said it would try to switch the meeting site from a government-controlled site to one under direct church control. This morning, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> traveled from <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Sucre </LOCATION>, another centrally located city, known for its Spanish-colonial architecture and its many churches. Crowds lined five deep to welcome the pope along a 2 -LCB- - mile motorcade on a clear, mild day Greeting <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> in this university city 9,150 feet above sea level was 88-year-old German-born Cardinal <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>, the retired archbishop of <LOCATION> Sucre </LOCATION> and this country's only cleric of cardinal rank. In his homily at an open-air Mass, the pope praised European missionaries who have worked in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> for nearly 500 years, saying they have strived to maintain the cultural identity of the <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> people, who are mostly of native Indian descent. On Wednesday night, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> addressed 22,000 young people gathered in a soccer stadium in <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION>, gateway to a large cocaine-producing region. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is a major source of the refined cocaine that reaches the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Bolivians themselves are becoming addicts in increasing numbers. The pope, dressed in a red cape and white scullcap, first warned against Marxism, then told his audience to avoid the temptation of easy riches through drug trafficking. `` Be alert not to be seduced by doctrines that try to justify violence and hate, that reduce members of the human family to simple factors of historical evolution and that place them in a class struggle,'' he said. He went on, `` Do not fall either into that selfish and false flight of seeking irrational satisfaction of appetites: abuse of alcohol, drugs, the absence of all moral norms in sexual conduct and the temptation of easy riches through drug trafficking.'' The youths cheered and applauded and waved <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> flags. The pope clearly enjoyed the youth rally, where he was greeted by native folk dances and songs. The young people lighted candles in the gathering darkness and sang `` Happy Birthday to You.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will be 68 on May 18. `` Muchas gracias,'' the beaming pontiff said. `` This was one of the most beautiful ceremonies I've ever seen.'' <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, whose military regime has been in office since 1954, is the last country the pontiff is to visit on his 12-day, four-country tour. <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> have the only remaining military regimes in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. An open-air Mass in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, which the pope visited in 1987, flared into a riot between police and foes of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators today reached agreement on all the technical issues that caused the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to postpone debate on a nuclear missile treaty before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration would report the results of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. The negotiators had disagreed over monitoring compliance with the treaty to scrap all American and Soviet medium - and shorter-range missiles President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the accord last Dec. 8. It was not known whether the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would accept the agreement worked out over two days in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> already has predicted further problems might arise in carrying out an unprecedented arrangement for on-site inspection of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missile plants and bases. He refused to criticize the Soviets, as some senators had done, and suggested the difficulties were the logical outcome of grappling with new verification procedures. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> flies to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Friday to report to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> on his talks. The dispute over how far <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> inspectors may go and what they may look at caused the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to postpone consideration of the treaty. The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit is scheduled for May 29-June 2. While <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> discussed the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the Iran-Iraq war and other regional issues, their senior arms control advisers worked on the technical issues. <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>, who negotiated the Intermediate Nuclear Forces, or INF treaty, led the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team. Col. Gen. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON>, an arms control expert of the Soviet armed forces, headed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation. The arms-control specialists reportedly reached a tentative agreement on the verification issues Wednesday night. On Wednesday, the two ministers held `` very businesslike and constructive talks'' and made progress `` in some areas,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The two met twice, in the afternoon and evening. One of their first tasks was to instruct their arms control negotiators to conduct separate talks to try to resolve outstanding issues. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had been due to begin debate on the treaty this week, but postponed it indefinitely after the disputes arose. Two principal stumbling blocks reportedly were among the issues settled Wednesday. One deals with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands to inspect Soviet missile containers big enough to hold only a stage of a rocket. The other involves how much access <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors will have to Soviet missile plants and bases. In another sign of progress, the two sides agreed on Wednesday to exchange notes on futuristic weapons. The aim is to persuade Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and other critics that the ban would apply to intermediate-range weapons that have not been developed yet The two sides also discussed prospects for a treaty reducing intercontinental nuclear forces, in a group headed by presidential arms control adviser <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> and chief Soviet arms control negotiatior <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Obukhov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> centered their talks Wednesday on scheduling and logistical arrangements for the summit. The two men also discussed human rights on Wednesday, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, but he did not provide details. The pact on intermediate-range missiles is unprecedented in its provisions for on-site inspection to guard against infractions. It also is the first U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate an entire category of nuclear weapons. Under its provisions, the Soviets would destroy 683 missiles and the Americans 364 _ all their rockets with ranges of 315 to 3,125 miles.

 An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 lost cabin pressure and had to make an unscheduled landing because of a 15-inch crack in the fuselage, an airline spokesman said today. The cause of the crack, near the right wheel well, could take several weeks of study to determine, said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>. The incident occurred Monday, and Federal investigators examined the plane Wednesday. A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 lost the top of its fuselage less than two weeks ago over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said the incidents were not related. American Flight 984, with 105 passengers and seven crew members, was en route Monday from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> when it suddenly lost cabin pressure. Cabin oxygen masks were deployed automatically before the landing. There were no injuries and no apparent disruption at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan Airport in <LOCATION> Romulus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, after the landing, officials said. No emergency was declared during the landing, <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. The aircraft was flown to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s maintenance center in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, and investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> were called in. `` An investigator has obtained the portion of the aircraft with a crack in it and has sent it to our metallurgical lab here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and it is being examined by our lab people,'' <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said investigators would try to determine whether the crack was due by metal fatigue or some other cause, such as an impact on the fuselage. He declined to say whether the crack could have been hazardous to the aircraft and its passengers. After the federal inspection, American replaced the cracked fuselage section and was testing the repaired jet today, <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said the plane had made 39,983 takeoffs and landings, and `` for a 727, that's not a high number of cycles.'' The problem occurred less than two weeks after a 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 lost part of its upper fuselage while flying over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, killing a flight attendant and injuring 61 passengers and crew members. The cause was suspected to be structural failure. But <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> discounted the similarity between the two incidents. `` What happened to our jet was in no way related to what happened in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today voted down an effort to ban most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> underground nuclear testing, rejecting claims by supporters of the ban that it would help stem the atomic arms race. The chamber voted 57-39 to kill the proposed ban as it worked through a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill. `` We must maintain unquestionable confidence in our nuclear deterrent and our experts tell us that this requires continued testing,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, a chief opponent. Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., the sponsor of the ban, said, `` no other issue addresses so clearly the runaway technology which is the lifeblood of the arms race. The House has approved an underground test ban in its version of the defense bill, meaning the issue will have to be resolved by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> that will resolve differences between the two measures. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed its defense bill Wednesday and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military is `` stronger and more capable'' now than when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office, despite <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s recurring complaints about not getting enough money for the Pentagon. `` By almost any measure, our armed services are better than they were in 1981,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>. `` The most dramatic increase is the quality of people, which is much, much better. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> commented shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 252-172 for a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget, which will be the last defense budget of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s eight-year presidency House approval split along party lines, with majority Democrats supporting the bill and Republicans opposing it. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did n't like it either, joining complaints by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans that the bill unfairly restricts his arms control policies and Star Wars program. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure bans Star Wars tests that violate the so-called `` narrow'' interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, and bars the purchase of any nuclear weapons that violate the numerical limits in the unratified 1979 SALT II nuclear arms treaty. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, by a 51-45 margin, rejected an attempt Wednesday to add the SALT II restriction to its defense bill. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opposes both restrictions and is also unhappy with the $ 3.5 billion approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, as Star Wars is formally known. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday for $ 4.6 billion. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted $ 4.8 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> next year, compared with the current SDI budget of $ 3.9 billion. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said he could n't understand the presidential complaints. `` I do n't believe the president has any reason to be upset. I think it's a good bill. We gave the president a lot of what he wanted.'' Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills authorize $ 299.5 billion worth of defense spending in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, a slight reduction from the current $ 300 billion <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget. The measures would essentially freeze defense spending for a fourth straight year, following four large annual increases in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term. No increases are likely in the future, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> predicted. `` I would guess that you're looking at perhaps a freeze, or maybe a decline of 1 or 2 percent, for the foreseeable future, which is the next three or four years, no matter who is elected president.'' Several factors will contribute to the reluctance to increase defense budgets, said <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>. `` First, there are the worries about the federal budget deficit. Then second, you have the fact that the Soviets appear to the American public to be less threatening under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, so there's less a push because of fear. `` You also have the fact that there are other fears, like drugs,'' he said, noting that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill orders <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to use the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military in the fight against illegal drug smuggling. `` In addition, there is a growing perception that national security depends on other things than simply military might, that it needs to include economic strength,'' he said. While the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure restricts <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s arms control policies and Star Wars, it granted his proposals for a vast variety of weapons. That total includes 180 F-16 jet fighter planes, 84 F-A-18 jets, 42 F-15 jets, a dozen F-14 jets, three new <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyers, two more attack submarines, one Trident missile-firing sub, the first of the new `` Seawolf'' class subs and 611 M-1 tanks. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decision on Star Wars came as the chamber voted 50-48 against a deep reduction in the 5-year-old program. That vote defeated a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., to reduce the SDI budget to about $ 3.8 billion and devote the extra $ 750 million to the space shuttle and a space station

<TEXT>
 Bank customers with loans pegged to the prime rate are about to feel the impact of the rising cost of money, but economists say a big increase in interest rates is unlikely this year. The first spike in the prime rate since the October stock market crash was announced Wednesday by major banks. The rise from 8.5 percent to 9 percent heralded a period of more expensive loans for purchases ranging from plant machinery to homes and cars. The prime rate reflects the banks' costs of borrowing money and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates. But the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including popular home-equity loans. Stock traders reacted badly to the rate rise, partly because it renewed memories of the higher interest rates that preceded the stock market crash. The <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 37.80 points to a three-month low of 1,965.85. The widely watched index partly recovered by late this morning, up nearly 10 points to the 1,976 level. In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of interest rates, prices were little changed. Many economists said they did n't believe interest rates would rise much further, largely because the economy could stumble badly if borrowing costs increased substantially. These economists argue that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appointee who has wide power to influence interest rates, does n't want to make any sudden move to tighten credit, especially in an election year. But the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> also wants to heed inflationary warning signs that have appeared, notably a 14-year low in the unemployment rate reported last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` It wants to tap the brakes a little bit rather than slam them on in a great fury,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said `` clearly, we're on an upward move in interest rates and they'll continue to move upward. But I think they'll flatten out. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blitzer </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the investment research and credit-rating concern, said he believed the prime rate would stay at 9 percent, perhaps moving to 9.5 percent by June. But <PERSON> Blitzer </PERSON> said he did n't believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would move to nudge rates much higher than they are now. `` I think this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> wants to keep the economy growing,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> injected billions of dollars in reserves into the banking system after the October crash to forestall a possible recession. But in recent months, evidence of surprisingly strong economic growth has shifted concern to rising inflation. This concern has been most evident in the bond market, where interest rates have been rising in anticipation that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would tighten its credit policies. Economists say it's clear the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has moved recently to nudge interest rates higher by controlling the amount of money in the banking system. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based forecasting firm, said the prime rate increase would have a broader impact on consumers now than in years past because it no longer is simply a benchmark for loans to bank corporate customers. `` Once upon a time, the impact would have been limited,'' she said. `` But now, because of the increased use of home-equity loans and other adjustable rates, even people who have current debt outstanding, they feel the effects. Their financing costs rise. It squeezes their discretionary spending in general.''

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the world's leading hog producer, has ended pork rationing, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. `` A Chinese agriculture official privately stated that pork rationing in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had stopped being enforced,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday `` Other officials said that pork rationing had ended throughout the country, though no official announcement has confirmed this.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began rationing pork in most major cities last fall in response to shortages. Pork traditionally supplies about 80 percent of the total animal protein in the Chinese diet. `` The pork shortages that led to the rationing did not, however, affect <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ability to supply hogs to its limited export markets -LRB- primarily <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' the report said. `` In fact, the country has had a surplus of hogs for export to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, but increases in hog trade between the two countries has been limited by a Chinese export quota.'' An end to rationing `` shows that Chinese agricultural officials believe the tight pork supply situation is now being resolved'' as producers respond to lower feed prices, higher pork prices and government incentives to promote larger production, the report said. `` It also is an indication that many urban consumers are willing to pay more for the higher-quality, free market pork instead of enduring the cheaper, fattier meat that has been sold at lower prices in state markets,'' the report said. A <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> study last year showed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had a 1983 year-end inventory of 298.5 million hogs, compared with 55.8 million in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But with more than five times the number of hogs, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s pork production was less than double the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> output _ 13.2 million metric tons to 7.6 million tons, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> study said. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds. The reason: It took only six months for an American farmer to raise a 243-pound hog ready for slaughter, while a newborn Chinese pig can take from eight to 18 months to reach a comparable slaughter weight. Also, the study said, the average <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hog will produce a dressed-out carcass of about 173 pounds, compared with the Chinese carcass of about 140 pounds.

<HEAD>Communist Leadership Offers Resignation Over Poor Investments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The entire 11-member politburo of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> offered to resign after the party treasury lost an estimated $ 2.25 million last year in poor investments, the media reported Thursday. The politburo, led by party chairman <PERSON> Arvo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aalto </PERSON>, offered its resignation at its meeting Wednesday. It will be considered at the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meetng later this month. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was not expected to accept all of the resignations. The Independent <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Helsingin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanomat </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial that there was `` no reason to feel malicious pleasure outside the party.'' <PERSON> Aalto </PERSON> was not available for comment Wednesday or Thursday. The failed foray into the investment market meant a further loss of face for the party after a steady loss of voter support over the past 10 years. Internal quarrels led to a party split before last year's parliamentary elections. In 1958, the party had 50 seats in the 200-seat parliament. In the 1987 election, the two Communist factions won a total of 20 seats.

<HEAD>U.N. Agency Launches Effort To Root Out Polio By Year 2000</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday endorsed a massive immunization campaign to protect all children against polio and eradicate the crippling disease by the year 2000. Only half the world's children are immunized, and 275,000 new cases of polio occur each year, mainly in developing countries, according to WHO. A committee of the 166-nation <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency passed by consensus a resolution calling for the eradication program. Approval by <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION>'s full assembly is expected Friday at the final session of the agency's annual meeting Polio is the major disease with the best chance of being stamped out, the resolution said. It asked <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION>'s director general to seek funds needed for the campaign and urged all countries to step up surveillance to permit quick identification of outbreaks. Eradication is expected to require doubling the $ 500 million the organization spends each year on immunization programs against six major childhood diseases in the Third World, including polio. The others are measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and tuberculosis. About 10 million people worldwide have been crippled by polio, and one patient in 10 dies of the disease, <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has reported the most cases of polio in recent years _ 14,629 in 1986. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> reported 1,843 cases, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> 1,600, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 1,537, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> 810 and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> 665. WHO estimates that only one case in 10 is reported to its headquarters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> Eliminating polio will be `` an appropriate gift, together with the eradication of smallpox'' to the next century, the resolution said. <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> led a global drive that eradicated smallpox by the late 1970s. Polio became rare in developed countries after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists developed two vaccines in the 1950s. WHO expects to eliminate the polio virus from the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> by 1990. The organization says it costs $ 10 to immunize a child against polio and other major diseases, although the cost can be higher to reach children in remote areas.

 Ethiopian rebels claimed Thursday that they destroyed some aircraft when they shelled the airport at <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s second - largest city and a provincial northern capital `` The airport was heavily damaged by the accurate shelling,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said over its clandestine radio in a broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. `` An as yet unknown number of aircraft were destroyed.'' Rebel spokesman <PERSON> Tesfai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghermazien </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> office, said the planes probably were military aircraft, but he had no further information. <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION> is an important military air base as well as a pickup point for cargo planes ferrying relief food to <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> drought victims. President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>'s government rarely comments on claims of the separatist rebels, who are waging wars in the provinces of Tigre and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>. There was no way to independently confirm the rebel report. Western diplomats and relief officials in the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, said they had heard nothing about an attack. But they said little information has come out of the region since the government expelled foreign aid workers from <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre on April 6. <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tigre </PERSON>, in the extreme north of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, are the hardest hit by the current drought. A massive Western-financed relief operation has been crippled by the expulsion of relief workers, but the government says the expulsions are for security reasons. <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>'s capital, is 670 miles north of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. The airport is about 1 -LCB- miles from the town and is guarded by troops in trenches along its perimeter. In the past week, the rebels and the government have both claimed victories in battles being fought within 60 miles of <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>. Rebels have shelled <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION> airport periodically over the past few years.

 Upper-crust Englishman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> `` Kim'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>, who for nearly three decades spied for the Soviets from the heights of British intelligence, died a decorated <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officer in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He was 76. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it learned from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> had died Wednesday. The embassy gave no cause of death. Four months ago, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> said he was suffering from arrhythmia, a heart irregularity. The most damaging double agent in modern British history, the suave, handsome <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> sent many Western agents to their deaths. With three now-deceased colleagues he met at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the 1930s _ <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Maclean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON> <PERSON> _ </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> turned <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most precious secrets over to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. By extension, he betrayed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, too, since he was privy to top-secret information exchanged by the two allies. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, today eulogized <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> as an `` outstanding'' master spy who helped defend the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from Western intelligence. It did not say how or where he died. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> waged `` a direct battle against the special services of capitalist countries, whose activity was directed against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, against the movement for peace and progress.'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> was on his way to becoming head of British intelligence when he came under suspicion in 1951, when <PERSON> Maclean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> _ who had been posted at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ fled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> was forced to resign from the service the following year, but he continued to free-lance for MI6, the British intelligence agency. By the time he was unmasked as the `` Third Man'' who tipped off <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maclean </PERSON> in time for them to escape British punishment, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> was settling into <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as a senior <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officer. The Maclean-Burgess-Philby spy scandals damaged the exchange of intelligence information between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for years. But of perhaps even more profound impact in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was that the establishment's own could be traitors. In 1979, Blunt's treachery was exposed publicly. In exchange for information, he had been allowed to escape disgrace, to receive a knighthood and to serve as the queen's art adviser for years. <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>'s death was front-page news in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today. The Times and other papers referred to him as `` Traitor <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>.'' There was no immediate comment from Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government. But legislator <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Leadbitter </PERSON> of the socialist opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>'s death `` brings an end, I hope, to the unhappiest period of betrayal of this century.'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> told <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> in January, in his first and only press interview with a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> reporter, that he had no regrets, except for personal friends he lost. Asked `` Would you do it all again?'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> replied: `` Absolutely.'' He said he had found peace, that he was happy in his fourth marriage, to a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> woman, and felt <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to be his home. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> was born on New Year's Day 1912 in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where his father was a colonial official, and was nicknamed <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> after the boy spy hero of a Rudyard Kipling story. His father was <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridger </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>, an eccentric explorer of Arabia who converted to Islam and settled in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital. Later <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> would write that he never felt patriotism toward any country. At <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, he fell under communism's spell. In those days of depression and early fascism, it was not unusual for idealistic young Englishmen to look to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` The Western democracies in the 1930s were too weak and corrupt to fight <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> wrote in his autobiography, `` My Silent War,'' published after he defected. <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> said a secret <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> guarded to the last was who first recruited him as a spy for the Soviets in 1934 not long after he returned from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, where he had been helping communists escape from the Austrian authorities. In 1940, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> joined British intelligence and rose to become head of its anti-Soviet section. In 1949, he went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s liaison officer with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. A decade after <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maclean </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, evidence of <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>'s involvement in espionage with them continued to mount. On Jan. 23, 1963, while working as a journalist in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> failed to pick up his third wife for a party. Six months later, the Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> announced he was in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Later, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> claimed MI6 deliberately engineered his defection, fearing embarrassment if he stood trial in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. After an initial hero's welcome in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> sank into obscurity and confessed to <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> that he went through depression and began heavy drinking when he believed the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> no longer had any use for him. <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> had several children. One, a son <PERSON> John </PERSON>, lives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s wife said the family had no comment on <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>'s death.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> will stop funding artificial heart research and will focus instead on smaller devices intended to assist rather than replace hearts, according to a report published today. `` While the -LRB- artificial heart -RRB- device seemed to work well, the biology did n't work,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION>, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` The human body just could n't seem to tolerate it. We were left wondering whether the idea of a permanent replacement will ever work,'' <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON> said in an interview published in The Atlanta Constitution and The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. The decision means four institutions awarded contracts last year for artificial heart research will receive only about $ 1 million of the $ 5 million each was expecting over the next five years. `` This is a tremendous setback for scientific advancement in the field,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, head of artificial heart research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>, which had received one of the contracts. He said the decision will set back development of a permanent artificial heart for more than 10 years. `` This does not mean the end of the artificial heart program. It means we are taking a different approach. It may take somewhat longer, but it may also help us develop a device that works better,'' <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> became the first recipient of an artificial heart Dec. 2, 1982, in surgery performed at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> by Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVries </PERSON>. He died the following March. Four other patients have received permanent artificial hearts, three at <ORGANIZATION> Humana-Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> DeVries </PERSON> now works, and one in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> was the longest survivor, living almost two years with the Jarvik-7 artificial heart. All of the patients, however, suffered severe complications, including strokes and major infections. <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON> said reports about those problems were one reason the government decided to withdraw support for continued development. Instead, the agency will focus its funding on smaller ventricular assist devices as stopgap measures for patients awaiting a transplanted human heart, he said. `` We believe it is time to try them in patients who need long-term support,'' <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON> said. So far such `` bridge'' devices have been been used only for a few weeks. <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON> said the government wants to see if they will work for three or four years at a time. The newspapers said the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> decision would be officially announced next week.

 <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today for `` hot pursuit'' authority against heavily armed marijuana growers who forced the closure of 886,000 acres of national forest land last year as unsafe for tourists and timber interests. Deputy <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing that his 150 law enforcement agents need statutory authority to pursue fleeing marijuana farmers beyond the boundaries of national forests and grasslands, especially in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where the problem is most acute. His request was endorsed by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga., who said `` these marijuana gardens are protected by a Marquis de Sade torture chamber of devices intended to maim, cripple or kill intruders. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., testifying at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agriculture subcommittee hearing, said illicit marijuana cultivation `` is a problem of staggering proportions'' in the West <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> is chief sponsor of a bill that would grant <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents authority to conduct investigations, searches, seizures and arrests outside the boundaries of national forests if drug crimes originate there. He said the agents are `` hamstrung'' under current law because `` they are authorized to go after these criminals, but only as long as they remain within the boundaries of the federal forests.'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> also proposed to stiffen federal penalties for unauthorized use of chemical herbicides and fertilizers in national forests, and to increase the maximum penalties for marijuana cultivation on those lands, which total 191 million acres in 44 states, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, a special agent in the <ORGANIZATION> Trinity-Shasta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, blamed the lack of `` hot pursuit'' authority on the poor success rate in prosecuting marijuana growers, who have an estimated $ 14 billion in annual profits. In 1986, <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said, 70 percent of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 872 arrests for illegal marijuana farming went unprosecuted because of hampered investigations. `` Law enforcement has failed to establish a deterrent to cultivation activity and has become in the eyes of the grower just another business expense,'' <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said. The subcommittee, chaired by <PERSON> Harkins </PERSON>, heard testimony that marijuana growers are using a wide variety of sophisticated weapons to guard their farming plots in national forests, including attack dogs who get their commands from radios mounted on their collars. <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said that during a raid on a drug lab near a national forest in southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Josephine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff `` seized a cache of weapons that could outfit a small army,'' including 51 machine guns, semi-automatic rifles and other automatic weapons, 100,000 rounds of ammunition and 150 pounds of gunpower.

 Armed guerrillas today seized a seminary where Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> is scheduled to speak this weekend, news reports said. Police said suspected rebels bombed a police bus and seriously wounded seven officers. The violence followed a mortar attack late Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and a car bombing near a <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> military installation, according to police reports. The violence comes just two days before the pope is scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. It was the heavist round of attacks in the capital this year. Police did not provide details, but news reports said a soldier guarding an officers' school was killed and two policemen wounded in the attack on the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Police said suspected guerrillas hurled a bomb at the bus, which was carrying police troopers on a downtown avenue during morning rush hour traffic. Eight armed members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> seized the <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toribio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> during a morning Mass and demanded that seminarians, priests and others attending join their insurgency, according to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programas </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s leading news station. The guerrillas fled when police arrived, and police launched a search, the radio said. There were no injuries. The pope, on a 13-day tour of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, is to arrive in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> Saturday from <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. He is scheduled to meet cultural and business leaders at the seminary Sunday. The pope is to leave for <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> Monday. There was no indication which guerrilla band carried out the other attacks. The Tupac Amaru group is smaller and considered less violent that the Mao-inspired Shining Path. The Shining Path's eight-year insurgency against the government of President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> has claimed 10,000 lives.

<TEXT>
 Girl Scout cookies bound for sailors aboard the USS Midway were shipped off to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> today after a persistent Brownie troop squeezed their shipment past Japanese tariffs through diplomatic means. The cookies, which had been sitting in an airline ticket office since they were returned from an April 26 shipment to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, left this morning, said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Titus </PERSON>, general manager for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. Troop 807 in <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION> had sold 402 boxes of cookies to the crew of the USS Midway, stationed in <LOCATION> Atsugi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with free shipment provided by the airline. But Japanese customs officials said they would have to levy a duty on the cookies, and they were returned to <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Japanese officials have denied that they said the duty would be $ 2,000. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, went through diplomatic channels to clear the matter up and sent a telegram to the Brownie troop on Wednesday. `` An officer on the USS Midway tells me that he is ready to go pick up your shipment of Girl Scout cookies when they arrive in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> this Friday,'' the telegram said. `` Everybody who was supposed to be getting the cookies was really upset when they did n't get them,'' said Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Sig </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolford </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION> on Wednesday while on leave from the aircraft carrier. <PERSON> Woolford </PERSON>, son-in-law of Brownie troop leader <PERSON> Marchetta </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, said sailors have been waiting for the cookies from home for more than two months. The cookies were scheduled to connect with a flight in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, then catch a flight to <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will be allowed to take the shipment duty-free. `` I think it's great and I'll tell the girls this afternoon at our regular meeting,'' said Ms. <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` I'm sure you'll hear a cheer go up.'' Japanese officials issued a statement Tuesday denying that the tariff ever was as high as originally reported. The Japanese Consulate in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> reported that the airline made an inquiry in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> about the cookies, but did not say that they were intended for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen stationed on a ship.

<HEAD>Time-Consuming Paperwork Will Be Shaved From Forest Service
Appeals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some of the time-consuming paperwork will be shaved from appeals resulting from <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> decisions involving wildfires and other natural disasters, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Chief F. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said a newly adopted interim rule primarily concerns future natural disasters in the national forests. However, he said the agency also `` needs to speed up appeal procedures for recovery and rehabilitation activities that resulted from 1987's severe fire season in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. It was this natural disaster that brought to our attention the need for special appeal procedures.'' Under the interim rule adopted today, anyone may appeal decisions on recovery and rehabilitation activities that result from natural disasters, such as wildfires, flooding, earthquakes and high winds, he said. Those who appeal will be entitled to a `` one-level appeal process'' which must be completed within 90 days, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. Previously, appeal processes could be reviewed at two administrative levels. An estimated 2.2 billion board feet of national forest timber were destroyed or damaged in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> in the 1987 fire season, with about 40 percent of that volume offered for sale, he said. `` A delay in fire-caused salvage sales and related rehabilitation activities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> could result in unnecessary losses of valuable natural resources,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. The fires disrupted the timber sale programs of several national forests, he said. As a result, the economies of timber-dependent communities in the burned areas could suffer from delays in salvage and rehabilitation work.

 A leftist guerrilla attack on a hydroelectric dam north of the capital killed 16 soldiers, injured 15 and caused a nationwide power shortage. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a correspondent for the Soviet newspaper Pravda was expelled from the country, and a military judge was fatally shot outside his home. Rebels destroyed five transformers and a central control board during their pre-dawn attack Wednesday at the November 5th Dam, said Col. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lempa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydroelectric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. The dam, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, supplies 22 percent of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s electricity needs, <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> said. `` The outage of the system of these five transformers practically leaves the dam out of service for a while. How long we can not say,'' <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> told a news conference. He said the attack would worsen an already severe electricity shortage caused by a drought and sabotage by leftist guerrillas, who have fought the U.S.-backed government for the last eight years. The power authority already had planned to start rationing electricity with three-hour daily cuts nationwide beginning Wednesday. The attack forced the authority to increase daily cuts to four hours, <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> said the guerrillas have mounted about 2,000 attacks on electrical installations causing $ 51 million in damage since the civil war began in October 1979. The guerrillas' last major attack on the dam was in June 1984. The Soviet journalist, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroev </PERSON>, was taken from the Hotel Camino Real on Wednesday by several men who said they were immigration officials, hotel employees said. He was the first Soviet correspondent to visit the country, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> here. The employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the gunmen asked <PERSON> Stroev </PERSON> to pack his luggage and accompany them. He was taken away in a vehicle driven by several plainclothes individuals, they said. An immigration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today that <PERSON> Stroev </PERSON> was deported to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. He said the journalist had been told he could stay only if he received military accreditation. <PERSON> Stroev </PERSON> had told colleagues earlier that he had applied for accreditation at the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the Armed Forces general staff, but officials there had told him they had run out of credentials. <PERSON> Stroev </PERSON> had arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Sunday. Also Wednesday, a man jumped from a jeep in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> neighborhood and shot <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, a military judge who handles cases related to the civil war. The jeep pulled up outside <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>'s home and the gunman fired four shots into the judge's car, witnesses said, speaking on condition they not be identified for fear of reprisal. The attacker escaped. <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, 45, died at the scene. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> was one of three military judges in charge of national security cases linked to the civil war. Some cases involved people suspected of cooperating with the guerrillas and others involved military officers. In January, <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> ruled that three men accused in the June 1985 shooting deaths of 13 people, including six Americans, should be freed under an amnesty program implemented in November. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> overruled <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>'s decision in April.

 A Swedish scientist won the $ 150,000 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement for helping focus international attention on how air pollutants are warming Earth's climate by creating a `` greenhouse effect.'' <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON>, 62, director of <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, will receive the money and a gold medallion Friday night in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the prize committee announced Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON> helped lay the groundwork in the 1940s and 1950s for modern computerized weather forecasting. But he was awarded the 1988 Tyler Prize for research done since the mid-1950s on the chemistry of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere and the effects of pollutants, especially carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. Carbon dioxide, methane and certain other gases trap heat in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere, much like glass traps heat in a greenhouse. Scientists say this `` greenhouse effect'' will warm Earth's atmosphere significantly during the next century, possibly causing sea levels to rise and triggering droughts, crop failures and other environmental damage Research by <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON>, who also is a meteorology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> and science adviser to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s prime minister, `` is of fundamental scientific importance,'' the prize committee said. `` He has been instrumental in determining how man's activities ... have drastically increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution.'' In a statement released by the committee, <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON> urged reassessment of energy policies, asking, `` How much coal, oil and gas can we continue to burn in light of the mounting evidence of negative atmospheric effects?'' The annual Tyler Prize, administered by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, was established in 1973 by outdoor enthusiasts <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> and her husband, the late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` is mortified'' that his Wednesday night endorsement of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential candidacy may have been seen by some as merely lukewarm, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman said today. `` He feels it was a very strong endorsement, very appropriate, sets the stage for him to talk about the vice president throughout the campaign,'' said <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a terse statement of support Wednesday night, mispronouncing the name of his vice president at one point. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides quickly expressed enthusiasm for the endorsement. At the White House today, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said any reports that the endorsement was merely lukewarm were `` most unfortunate.'' He said of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` He is mortified. He thought the speech was terrific. He wrote it himself. He thought it was strong, a full endorsement of his vice president who he thinks incredibly highly of.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> delivered the long-awaited endorsement of his 1980 and 1984 running mate at a Republican fund-raising dinner Wednesday night, telling his audience he would `` campaign as hard as I can'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The president, bestowing his approval on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign more than two weeks after the vice president mathematically clinched the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary, came in a brief three sentences at the conclusion of a 15-minute speech. While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s backing was never in doubt, the president had stuck to a promise to remain netural as long as there were other challengers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remaining rival, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, announced earlier Wednesday that he would support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. During his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mentioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> only three times, mispronouncing his name on one of those occasions as `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosh </PERSON>.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides immediately stressed that they were pleased with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s announcement, no matter how brief. `` It's a total endorsement,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. `` I would not look for what was n't said. I would look for what was said. I'm fully satisfied. I do n't think it gets any better.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, said `` it looks like an endorsement to me.'' `` These guys love each other,'' he added. Speaking at a $ 1,500-a-plate banquet attended by more than 3,000 Republicans, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> concluded a speech about the accomplishments of his administration with these words: `` I intend to campaign as hard as I can. My candidate is a former member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, Director of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and national chairman of the Republican party. I'm going to work as hard as I can to make Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' In endorsing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was breaking `` a silence I've maintained for some time with regard to the presidential candidates. Earlier in the speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` Eight years ago, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I said to the American people, ` the time is now.' It still is. The story of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is one of people who have made their dreams come true, by realizing that the time for action is always now.'' It was in that reference that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mispronounced the name of his vice president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was traveling to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today for a seven-day campaign trip to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s formal endorsement follows several weeks of jockeying among <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aides over a time and place for the announcement. At the end of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> worked their way through the crowd on the floor to join the president and First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the podium. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held clasped hands aloft as hundreds of balloons were released from the ceiling. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who spoke before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, praised the president, saying: `` You began a great national renewal.'' Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, whose own presidential bid was stopped in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s march to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, displayed his sometimes barbed wit. `` Thank you, thank you very much,'' he said when he was applauded. `` I was going to say, I would accept the nomination, but I think it's already been spoken for.'' `` I ca n't remember the guy who got it,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> announced his suport for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after a private session between the two at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, claiming `` the race is pretty much over.'' The former television minister has won only 46 delegates. He said he would wait until Monday before formally withdrawing to give his supporters a chance to win additional national convention seats at <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses this weekend in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` I did n't ask anything for myself. I spoke about education and the need to bring the 1984 platform into line with the realities of 1988,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` We definitely had a meeting of the minds on the platform.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign later said in a statement that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had said he was not withdrawing, but that he would address his campaign status on Monday.

<HEAD>Dukakis Strong in California, But Demographics Good for Jackson</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrats are likely to go for the favorite next month, abandoning their longtime penchant for backing underdogs in presidential primaries, pollsters say. But the tradition may not succumb without a fight. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is substantially ahead of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in opinion polls, most recently in a Gallup survey this week giving <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 67 percent to 26 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and 7 percent undecided. But if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the heavy favorite to win, pollsters said in recent interviews, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> still may do better than his recent finishes, perhaps well enough to boost his influence at the party's convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> `` I would be extremely surprised if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got over 40 percent,'' said I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, chief of polling for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. While that strong a showing is by no means assured, pollsters say there are several reasons <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could do well in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on June 7. One is demographics: Many of the voters fit the profile of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters. Another is history: <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has found support from whites elusive, did his best on that score in his 1984 campaign with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> whites. Yet another factor is a decreased expectation that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> can win the nomination. Several analysts said dissatisfied Democrats may be more likely to cast a protest vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> when it appears he can not actually win. `` When you do n't think <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is a viable nominee he gets a better vote than when you do,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. He noted that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support from whites fell off after the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary, when he looked strong But after losing a series of landslides, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got 24 percent of the white vote in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> this week, his second-best showing among whites all year. Given the liberalism of many <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrats, `` there's a number of people that would like to give him bargaining chips in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> by his showing well here _ people who may not want him to be president but want to give him some clout,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. Any added clout from second place would stem from vote totals rather than the delegate count; the primary is a winner-take-all contest, with delegates awarded only to the first-place finisher in each congressional district. Pollsters stressed that a victory by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> would be exceedingly difficult, even with his plans to campaign heavily in the state. Blacks, who have been giving him support in the 90-percent range, made up only about 15 percent of the primary electorate in 1984, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has not increased blacks' share of the vote in most other states. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in 1984 won four of the state's 45 congressional districts and received 21 percent of the vote statewide. `` Conventional wisdom is that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should do better than four years ago, but not dramatically,'' said California-based pollster <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON>.

Still, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have a history of backing the anti-establishment candidate. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> went for <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> over front-runner <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> over President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1980, favorite son Gov. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> over <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1976, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> over <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> in 1972. Added pollster <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> there is more liberal than the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the rest of the country.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, a poll analyst for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, noted that four years ago 45 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> voters in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> identified themselves as liberals, 24 percent were under 30 and 40 percent were college graduates _ all groups in which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has done his best among white voters. `` It's got good demographics for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. He said a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> exit poll found that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got 13 percent of the white vote in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the only state that year in which he reached double digits. That poll said 7 percent of the vote in 1984 was Jewish, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has fared poorly among Jews because of concern about his position on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But homosexuals could make up 5 percent of the vote and may favor <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' resistance to homosexual couples as adoptive parents. Hispanics made up 9 percent of the electorate in 1984 in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lost Hispanics badly to the Spanish-speaking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> this year, with 60 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 20 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll. Still, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> noted that the 1984 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> electorate was only 25 percent Catholic and one-third blue collar, groups that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been winning. And the primary is closed, meaning independents, who have backed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, ca n't vote. If the black vote reaches 20 percent and goes entirely to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, he still would need 31 percent of the remainder to beat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ a level of non-black votes that he has achieved only in one state this year, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> traded kind words with Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> today at the Capitol, one day after <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> finally got President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s public promise to `` campaign as hard as I can'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> this summer and fall. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement of support Wednesday night was brief, and he mispronounced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s name once. But White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today it would be inaccurate to call the endorsement lukewarm and he said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` is mortified'' that it may have been seen that way. `` He feels it was a very strong endorsement, very appropriate, sets the stage for him to talk about the vice president throughout the campaign,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' only remaining Democratic rival, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, brushed aside this week's losses in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> with his stock line that his candidacy is `` winning every day.'' All three candidates were to campaign today in Western states, as the race pointed toward June 7, with its big delegate payoff from races in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has been criticized by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for lacking foreign policy experience, met for 30 minutes with <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to lobby for new sanctions aimed at ending apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor told reporters he `` very strongly'' supported legislation to apply such sanctions. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said `` we did n't have a point at which we disagreed.'' `` I do n't think we need to give an endorsement, but we know we would be amongst friends and we would have very, very powerful friends in the White House if we had a Democrat occupying the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, standing with <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, praised `` your courage and your leadership.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said, `` God bless you.'' On another foreign policy issue, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in answer to questions, voiced reservations about a deal reported to be being worked out by the administration to have <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leave office in exchange for dropping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug indictments against him. `` I do n't think you drop indictments against drug pushers and people suspected of murder,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He also was meeting with Latin American ambassadors and making the rounds on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, meeting with leaders including <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said after meeting with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that he was `` the candidate best able to lead our nation.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was formally given <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement at a pricey <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday night. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had remained neutral during the fight for the Republican nomination, but the vice president has had a mathematical lock on the nomination since the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary last month. The president said the time had come to break his silence. `` I intend to campaign as hard as I can,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to work as hard as I can to make Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The brief endorsement came at the end of a lengthy speech in which the president cited his administration's accomplishments. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> referred to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by name three times, at one point calling him `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosh </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who preceded the president at the podium, praised <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for `` your simple humanity, your decency and your strength,'' adding: `` What an inspiration you have been to all of us.'' After <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined him and the two clasped hands and held them high, while hundreds of red, white and blue balloons were released. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s former rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> drew laughter from the crowd at the Republican event when _ acknowledging applause as he rose to speak _ said: `` I would accept the nomination, but I think it's already been spoken for.'' Hours before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got the blessing of former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who technically remains a candidate although he has long ceased active campaigning and has only 46 delegates to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1,344, according to the latest <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> count. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to formally bestow his support on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> afterward he would withdraw from the race on Monday, and would be releasing his delegates. But later, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinsky </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was suspending his campaign rather than quitting outright, and would release his delegates, but not right away. Still later, the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> campaign weighed in with a press release asserting that the former television evangelist had told reporters he was not withdrawing and was not releasing his delegates. It promised <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> would discuss his campaign status on Monday, however. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> led a march against drugs through a crime-ridden neighborhood in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, and talked to Indian leaders near a reservation in central Oregon. `` I earn my votes every day,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a cheering crowd in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>. `` When I win, you win.'' In other developments: _ Former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> has notified <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials that he does not want to be invited to address the party's national convention in August, a party source says The source, who insisted on anonymity, said there was sentiment among party officials to invite <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to address the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> convention. But <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who was driven from office by the Watergate scandal, was aware that his appearance would be controversial, the source said. _ Supporters of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have filed a formal challenge to the delegate selection process in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, where state party officials were preparing for a state committee meeting over the weekend to choose the last of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>' delegates to the Democratic National Convention in July in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Backers say <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should have been allocated 12 national delegates instead of the seven he received, based on the results of county caucuses March 19.

<TEXT>
 A potholed street has cost <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> almost $ 1 million in a settlement that nearly wiped out its litigation reserve fund, officials said. City Council approved, by a 5-2 vote Wednesday, a $ 969,000 settlement with a man whose wife was killed three years ago by a motorist who swerved after hitting a pothole. In a suit in state district court, the family of <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rowlett </LOCATION> had sought $ 2.4 million from the city for failing to fill the pothole, which was about 8 inches deep and 3 feet across. The suit contended the city had been negligent because it failed to properly maintain the street despite a complaint filed with the Streets and <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. City Attorney <PERSON> Analeslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON> said the city's litigation fund has `` just a little'' more than $ 1 million, which must last until Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. In 1985, there was no state limit on death claims resulting from faulty street maintenance. The state's 1987 tort reform law set a $ 250,000 limit. The lawsuit, filed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, stems from a Nov. 18, 1985, accident that killed Mrs. <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, 48. Under <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law, a city may be held liable for an accident caused by a pothole only if a complaint has been filed and there was time for crews to fill it.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has delayed for a second day a major nuclear weapons test at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site. The test was rescheduled for Friday morning. Thursday's delay was blamed on technical problems at instrumentation trailers near ground zero. The test was originally scheduled for Wednesday, but was delayed because of unfavorable wind conditions. DOE spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoerg </PERSON> said workers had to go back to a trailer area near ground zero to correct the technical problems, and the problems could not be resolved in time to conduct the test Thursday. The trailers house instruments used to record data from the tests. The test, code-named <PERSON> Schellbourne </PERSON>, is the third announced shot this year.

 The defense ended its closing arguments today in the cocaine-smuggling trial of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, ridiculing prosecutors for trying to make the Colombian appear responsible for the nation's drug problem. `` If that is true, you could lock up the doors to this courthouse and tear down all the ` Just Say No,' signs,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said, referring to a national anti-drug week campaign. <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> urged the jury to make an independent judgment about the charges against <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, saying `` The government does not own the jury _ noboby owns the jury.'' Counsel for Lender's co-defendant, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, also was expected to finish his closing arguments today, followed by a rebuttal from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>. The case was scheduled to go to the jury Friday. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, and <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, are charged with conspiring to smuggle about 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> via <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s private Bahamian island, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, from 1978 to 1980 A separate <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment accuses <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> of being one of the leaders of the so-called <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, a violent Colombian smuggling ring believed to be responsible for a major portion of the cocaine entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> spent this morning hammering again at what he said were inconsistencies in the testimony of government witnesses, many of whom were admitted smugglers given immunity for their testimony. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said chief prosecution witness, convicted smuggler <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, was `` given the break of a lifetime'' for his testimony against <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>. By agreeing to cooperate with the government, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was able to reduce a possible 215-year sentence and $ 5.9 million fine to less than six years in prison, <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> reviewed what he termed `` the litany of lies'' testified to by several members of <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s group of American smugglers. `` These people planned to dump on Mr. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>. These people knew how to get an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> card to freedom,'' he said. `` You ca n't believe any of these people without hesitation,'' the defense attorney said. <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> urged the panel to focus on the actual charges listed against <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in the indictment and not what he called the government's attacks on his character. `` The issue is not whether Mr. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was good or bad. The issue in this case is the 11 counts in the indictment,'' said <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>. He said the actual charges were discussed in only five weeks of the 22-week case. `` Mr. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> has no burden of proof. It is the obligation of the prosecutors to prove <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,'' he said. Winding up his prosecution arguments Wednesday, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> referred to testimony that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> used bribes, charm and threats to run a smuggling empire. For once, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> could n't use such tools. `` He can not buy his way out of a just verdict. He can not charm his way out of a just verdict. And he can not force his way out of a just verdict,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said. The prosecutor said <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was responsible for smuggling 19 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, earning him $ 20 million. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was captured in February 1987 at a mansion near the town of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> after a shootout between Colombian army troops and his bodyguards. He was whisked onto a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The prosecution called 115 witnesses in the trial, which began in October. Last week, defense attorneys surprised the courtroom by announcing they would call no witnesses. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy.

 Federal drug agents say the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for 18 years stood in the way of efforts to smash drug smuggling by Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, according to a story by the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps-Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` We found out about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'' shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dangerous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugs </ORGANIZATION> was established in 1968, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickler </PERSON>, former chief of Central American investigations for the bureau, was quoted as saying in a <ORGANIZATION> Scripps-Howard </ORGANIZATION> story published today. `` It was organized crime controlled by government,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, former director of foreign operations for the bureau. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was a rising power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 1968. He had just helped Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> become <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president in a coup and was rewarded with the job of military intelligence chief. The now-retired agents were quoted as saying they obtained their first hard evidence linking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to drug smuggling in 1970, when a group of Panamanians was arrested trying to bring a boatload of marijuana into <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The captain had an address book listing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s name and telephone number along with those of well-known Latin American drug traffickers. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, then chief of the bureau's Latin American intelligence division, said the captain told agents he had picked up the drug cargo in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and paid <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> a cut of the profits. Less than a year later, the agents learned that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had arranged through <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Him </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, chief air traffic controller at the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> airport, to smuggle heroin onto planes from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s cut, they said, was $ 100,000 a shipment, with 90 - to 150-pound shipments leaving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> daily Agents arrested <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> in February 1971 and said they were ready to pounce next on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, until the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> became involved. The agents were quoted as saying that <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>' arrest had angered <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayre </PERSON>. `` We were open about what we were doing -LRB- in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Strickler </PERSON> said, but the agents say they did n't want to tell <PERSON> Sayre </PERSON> in advance that they intended to arrest <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>. They said they feared he might not keep quiet because he was more concerned about maintaining friendly relations with <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> during negotiations to seal a new canal treaty and solve the issue of Canal Zone sovereignty. They lured <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> into the Canal Zone with an invitation to play in a softball game. After <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>' arrest, `` <PERSON> Sayre </PERSON> wanted to know everything we were doing all the time,'' <PERSON> Strickler </PERSON> said. He also ordered the agents that he felt were most responsible for the <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> arrest to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the agents said. `` State Department officials in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> began reviewing all bureau confidential cables on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> and refused to send some of them on because they felt it would upset the government,'' <PERSON> Strickler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>' arrest had outraged and unnerved <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> so much that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had to beg for the general's forgiveness, the agents say. `` As <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> became more known, nothing we said made an impression on the State -LRB- Department -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Strickler </PERSON> said. Some current and former administration and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials deny ignoring <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s drug smuggling or interfering with agents who tried to stop him. They say they were never shown hard evidence of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s involvement in drugs. Others, however, back up the agents. The bureau become the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in 1973.

 The White House will quickly follow up President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the wide-ranging trade bill with attempts to get another form of the legislation passed, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman said today. `` We wil seek to get a new bill,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said as the bill was being analyzed by administration officials in advance of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s promised veto. `` At the moment, the plan is to talk to the -LRB- congressional -RRB- leadership and see what happens.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, as he has previously, refused to say what form the administration believes a trade bill should take, although he indicated there is no White House interest in trying to salvage a plant-closing provision.

 A 450-pound Siberian tiger named <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> crashed through a window to attack and kill an employee at the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Zoo this morning, zoo officials said. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>, 59, was killed after the tiger went crashed through a 2 -LCB- - foot-wide window that was part of his cage, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Werler </PERSON>, zoo director `` It cut him up and ate him up pretty good,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> paramedic <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>, a 10-year-employee of the zoo, was found by a co-worker about five minutes after the 7:45 a.m. attack. The tiger was outside in a natural habitat display while <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON> was in an interior hallway when the attack occurred. The tiger crashed through a window, attacked the zookeeper and dragged him outside. The animal ran into an enclosed part of its cage after zoo curator <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dieckow </PERSON> fired three shots and sprayed a fire extinguisher to scare it. The animal was not wounded. <PERSON> Werler </PERSON> said the Siberian tiger would probably not be destroyed because it is an endangered species. The tiger initially was reported to be named `` Rambo,'' the other male Siberian tiger at the zoo. One of <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>'s jobs was to feed the big cats. About 90 minutes after the attack, an orange sheet was draped over what appeared to be a body on the ground at the zoo's tiger display. The display was roped off with yellow tape. The zoo opened for business about 10:30, about 30 minutes later than usual. The tiger has been isolated in its cage, officials said. The Siberian tiger is the largest of eight types of tigers and can measure up to 13 feet and weigh as much as 720 pounds.

 The cover of <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>'s new album, `` Lovesexy,'' reveals most of the rock star, but it may not be easy to find. `` Between 75 -LRB- percent -RRB- and 90 percent of our customers are going to take a pass on it,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, chairman of Bloomington-based <ORGANIZATION> Lieberman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, which stocks record departments in such department and discount stores as <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pamida </ORGANIZATION> and ShopKo. `` They find it objectionable.

 The movie `` Dead Heat'' might be dead meat by the time actor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> gets done promoting it. `` It's an interesting thing because it's not really my kind of film.

 Israeli warplanes blasted a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla base south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today in the eighth air raid on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year, police said. They said six fighter-bombers rocketed the targets near the <LOCATION> Kharroub </LOCATION> region town of <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION> in three bombing runs. <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION> is 16 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The raid began at 6:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes. There was no immediate report of casualties or damage. Police said the target appeared to be a base of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. They said from the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, nine miles south of <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION>, that smoke could be seen billowing from the bombed base. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the military command said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes raided guerrilla bases north of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. The brief statement said all Israeli planes returned safely to their bases and that pilots reported accurate hits on their targets. The attacking planes drew anti-aircraft fire, but no hits were claimed, the Lebanese police said. The Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, headed by former Syrian army Captain <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, is based in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and bankrolled by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.

 An explosion and fire at a metals plant today killed one person, injured at least eight others and prompted the evacuation of neighboring businesses, officials said.

The dead man was identified only as a temporary worker hired from an employment service. The plant processes powdered metal into a substance used in metal rod coatings, workers said. `` I think my ceiling fell in _ I'm not sure _ behind me. But I just ran out the side door,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Sobola </PERSON>. She said workers were `` just running out and collapsing outside the doors.'' A hazardous materials team of the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was at the scene. The fire was controlled about noon. `` The dust was so heavy you could n't see in front of your face,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Eakman </PERSON>, a chemist for <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency eulogized <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> `` Kim'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> on Thursday as a master spy who carried out heroic and seemingly impossible feats to protect the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from Western agents. <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> died Wednesday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where he had lived since defecting to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1963. As a rising star in British intelligence, the upper crust Englishman spied for the Soviets for 26 years. He eventually became a decorated <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officer. `` On May 11, 1988, in the 77th year of his life, the remarkable Soviet intelligence officer <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> died,'' the official news agency reported in a brief dispatch. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not elaborate on the circumstances of <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>'s death or say where it occurred. The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> had died in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. With three colleagues, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Maclean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON>, the Cambridge-educated <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> turned <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most precious secrets over to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. `` For a long time, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> was engaged in exceptionally delicate work, or, better said, a struggle directly within the special services of the capitalist countries whose thrust was spearheaded against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the world's progressive movement,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` These were years of truly Titanic nervous stress which required the whole of his spiritual and physical forces,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Not infrequently <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> was able to accomplish things which seemed well-nigh impossible to achieve.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>'s activities `` heroic'' and `` multifaceted and vast in their geographic sweep.'' `` In 1963, having successfully accomplished a regular assignment, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where he continued the work that had become the reason and content of his entire life,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Being an internationalist, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> loved his own English people, valued their spiritual richnesses and believed in their happy future,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. While spying for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> sent many Western agents to their deaths. He was even able to head off the defection of a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomat who threatened to expose him. For his services to Soviet intelligence, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> was awarded the nation's highest decoration, the Order of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, and other awards including the Red Banner and the Order of the Patriotic War, First Class, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. After an initial hero's welcome in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> sank into obscurity and confessed in an interview with a British newspaper earlier this year that he went through depression and began drinking heavily when he believed that the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> had no further use for him. But <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> told <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in his first and only interview with a Western publication since his defection that he had no regrets, except for personal friends he had lost. Asked `` Would you do it all again?'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> replied, `` Absolutely.'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> said then that he had found peace, was happy in his fourth marriage, to a Soviet woman, and that he felt at home in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He told <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> last November he wanted to be buried in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, `` which I considered to be my country since the 1930s.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> announcement of his death gave no details of funeral arrangements.

<TEXT>
 Chocolate milk, that longtime mainstay of kids' lunches, wo n't be on the elementary schools' menu come fall because the school board thinks it's unhealthy for growing minds. Instead, a calcium-fortified orange drink may be offered. Some teachers and nurses who have expressed concern about children having sweets at lunch requested the ban, Superintendent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said Wednesday. The panel voted 5-4 this week to discontinue selling chocolate milk at lunch to the 4,000 pupils in the township's 10 elementary schools. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said several school employees said they noticed children who drank chocolate milk for lunch showed signs of hyperactivity in the afternoon. `` Whether that's scientifically qualified, I do n't know,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. Chocolate milk outsells regular milk 2-1 at <ORGANIZATION> Aletta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crichton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeClementi </PERSON> said. `` That's eight cases of chocolate to four cases of white a day,'' he said. <PERSON> DeClementi </PERSON> said he was unaware of behavior problems that might be tied to the chocolate milk. Both he and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said they doubt the ban will provoke an outcry. But if it does, school board President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON> said the panel could change its decision. Bridge, who cast the tie-breaking vote, said he was a fan of the banished beverage. `` I love chocolate milk,'' Bridge said. `` But yes, there is a lot of merit to the fact that chocolate has an effect on children.''

 A man accused of the Christmas holiday slayings of 14 relatives and two other people was convicted today of capital murder and five counts of attempted capital murder. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' defense had rested this morning without presenting any evidence. The jury deliberated for 84 minutes. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was on trial for a Dec. 28 rampage that left two people dead and four injured. He is to be tried in the other 14 killings in July. Capital murder applies to crimes involving multiple killings under <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> law, and the jury was to consider the sentence this afternoon. There are only two sentences for a person convicted of capital murder _ life imprisonment without parole or death. The circuit court jury also reduced a kidnapping charge to first-degree false imprisonment and convicted <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> on that charge. The attempted murder charges referred to the four people <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> wounded, plus another person who was fired at but was not hit. Circuit Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> read the jury's verdicts to a standing room only crowd of about 100. <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shields </PERSON>, and her husband, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, relatives of some of the <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' family victims, were pleased. Tears welling in her eyes, Mrs. <PERSON> O'Shields </PERSON> displayed a photograph of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' late 17-year-old <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> and said, `` Is n't it a shame.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 47, had no immediate reaction to the verdict. `` The evidence in this case is strong; it's stout,'' said Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> during a 32-minute closing statement this morning. The defense's closing argument lasted 34 minutes, most of it by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Doc </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, who contended that there was a lack of evidence to support a contention of premeditation and deliberation. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> also said there were no tests to link <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> to the murder weapons and other evidence. <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said such tests were unnecessary when witnesses testified about details and the police chief had testified that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> handed him the murder weapon. The state rested late Wednesday and <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> denied defense motions for directed verdicts and dismissal of the charges. The defense rested this morning. A route salesman who chatted with <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> testified Wednesday that a month before the Christmas-time killings began, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was talking about settling some scores. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> `` said he had a few people in town he would like to get even with,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON>, 49, told the jury. `` <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was the only name he called.'' The state contends that on Dec. 28, 1987, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> shot six people, including <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>; two of the six died. After <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> surrendered, police searched his home and found the bodies of 14 family members, all shot to death or strangled. <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON> was the last of 30 state witnesses who testified in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circuit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> in the trial of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> on a charge of capital murder for the slaying of two people plus five counts of attempted capital murder and one count of kidnapping. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> could face the death penalty if convicted. <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON> said his talk with <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 47, took place in a small <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> market where <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was a cashier and to which <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON> delivered bread and cake on a daily route. A state ballistics expert, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, testified that markings on bullets taken from the two murder victims showed they had been fired by the same nine-shot revolver that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> handed to police when he surrendered. Killed were <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, 24, at a <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> law firm where she worked and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, 33, at a <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> oil company. A man also was wounded and a woman shot at, but not hit, at the oil company. Police said Ms. <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> once refused <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' amorous attentions. Bullets recovered from the market, where <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> had quit his job 10 days before the shooting, came from the same pistol, <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. Two people were wounded at the market. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> also allegedly shot a former co-worker at a freight company, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Butts </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Butts </PERSON>, whose husband assisted her to and from the witness box, said she and <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> once had a bad encounter while they worked together. Later, after she told him to do a better job with some of the accounts he was handling, `` he got angry,'' she said. `` He screamed. He shouted acrss the office that he did n't get paid enough,'' which led to a discussion about how he had treated her on that previous occasion. Mrs. <PERSON> Butts </PERSON> was shot in the back of the head and the bullet went into her heart, for which she underwent open heart surgery. The shooting let her unable to bend her left leg and with poor vision. <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who the state says was taken hostage at the freight company after Mrs. <PERSON> Butts </PERSON> was shot, testified earlier Wednesday. `` <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON>, I'm not going to hurt you,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> told her as he held a gun to her temple. `` I came to kill <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>. I got everybody that hurt me. I'm not going to hurt you.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday for `` hot pursuit'' authority against marijuana growers in national forests whose illicit crops are protected by powerful weapons and snarling guard dogs that respond to commands sent through radio-equipped collars. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency that oversees 191 million acres of national forests and grasslands, said his law enforcement agents are severely hampered by a legal prohibition against pursuing marijuana growers beyond the boundaries of federal lands. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> special agent assigned to <ORGANIZATION> Shasta-Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, blamed the lack of `` hot pursuit'' for the poor success rate in prosecuting growers who cultivate the potent variety of marijuana known as `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gold'' in his region. The request for statutory authority to pursue those engaged in what <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> called `` a major billion-dollar criminal industry'' in national forests was endorsed by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga., at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Agriculture subcommittee hearing `` These marijuana gardens are protected by a Marquis de Sade torture chamber of devices intended to main, cripple or kill intruders,'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said. `` Hunters and hikers have been injured in these booby traps.'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said heavily armed marijuana growers forced the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to close 886,000 acres of national forest lands last year as unsafe for visitors, commercial interests and federal employees. The witness table at the hearing was littered with samples of weapons used by marijuana growers to keep intruders away. Among them were a Uzi submachine gun, hand grenades, makeshift shotguns attached to rat traps and trip wires, boards studded with heavy nails and triple fish hooks designed to be strung at eye level from tree branches. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., testified that during one raid on a methamphetamine laboratory near a national forest in southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the county sheriff `` seized a cache of weapons that could outfit a small army. He said they included 51 machine guns, semi-automatic rifles, anti-aircraft guns and other automatic weapons, 100,000 rounds of ammunition and 150 pounds of gunpowder. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials said the growers also set out poisoned feed to kill wildlife that eat marijuana plants, and sabotage the equipment of timber workers and other commercial operators. The growers train guard dogs to respond to commands to attack intruders when an electrical shock is activated in their collars by a remote radio signal, the hearing was told. `` These people mean business,'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said. `` These are modern-day moonshiners,'' <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> said, `` but they are a lot more sophisticated than the old moonshiners.'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> eradicated more than 250,000 marijuana plants from 220 cultivation sites last year, about 40 percent of all the marijuana being produced in national forests. But agent <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said eradication efforts are not enough. `` The solution lies in increased arrests, thorough investigations, aggressive prosecutions and sentences that clearly establish a deterrent to the temptation to spend six months and ` earn' half a million dollars tax-free,'' he said. <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, declaring that the $ 14 billion domestic marijuana industry is `` threatening the quality of life all over the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>,'' urged support for his bill to grant <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents to conduct investigations, searches, seizures and arrests outside national forests where drug crimes occur. He also proposed to strengthen federal penalties for unauthorized use of fertilizers and chemical herbicides in national forests, and to stiffen the maximum penalties for marijuana cultivation on those lands. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials said the maximum federal penalty for using booby traps or other weapons at illicit marijuana farms now is 10 years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. Additional penalties for marijuana cultivation depend on the amounts involved, they said.

 <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> `` Kim'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> is dead, but the bitter aftertaste of his colossal betrayal still lingers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Even 25 years after the privileged English gentleman was unmasked as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s highest-placed mole in Western intelligence, central questions remain unanswered: Were there others of higher rank? Were the operations of Western intelligence agencies compromised more seriously than they realize? When <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> gave his only interview to a Western journalist four months before he died, was it part of a new plot by his <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> masters to discredit the British and undermine their relationship with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>? A tribute to <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> came Thursday, the day after he died at age 76, from <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a former British intelligence officer. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has done much to keep the scandal alive with his allegation that an even higher mole existed: the late Sir <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, who directed the MI5 security service from 1956 to 1965. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s claim is in his volume of memoirs, called `` Spycatcher,'' which is banned in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In a statement from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, where he now lives, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> `` an outstanding man in the intelligence world.'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> became a Soviet agent while at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the 1930s, joined the secret service and rose to high rank. He was believed to be in line to head MI6, the sister service of MI5. His network unraveled in 1951 with the defection of <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Maclean </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> escaped exposure for 12 more years. In 1963 he, too, defected. In 1964 the `` fourth man,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON>, confessed he had worked for the Soviets while in MI5 and received immunity in exchange for information about the other three. His treason was kept secret and he eventually became art adviser to Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, receiving a knighthood. Blunt's past was made public in 1979 and he was stripped of his honors. He died in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1983. The damage to <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> security, which shared secrets with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is incalculable. Now that all four of `` Stalin's Englishmen'' finally are dead, the suspicion persists that there were five <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s claim about <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, whether true or not, illustrates the doubt that still eats at the British security services because of <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>'s treachery. `` It's bad for morale, and it's actually bad for operations,'' said <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Allason </PERSON>, a Conservative member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and who writes histories and analyses of espionage under the name <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>. He said the suspicions mean intelligence analysts must ask themselves constantly whether the files they use contain `` tainted information'' left by the traitors. <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> still was a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officer when he died, and intelligence experts here believe the lengthy interview he gave in January to <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> was a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> operation. `` The Soviets had things in mind that they wanted to accomplish,'' said <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officer living in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allason </PERSON>, in separate interviews, said the purpose was to revive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suspicions of British intelligence generated by the <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> affair. They pointed to remarks by <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> to <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> in which he hinted that other traitors remained in British intelligence and that the British could not be trusted to keep secrets. <PERSON> Allason </PERSON> said <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> had clearly hinted to <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> that there were other moles, still undiscovered. He also saw hidden purpose in letting <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> see how comfortable and privileged <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> was in his adopted homeland. `` It was a carrot to other people'' who might want to defect, <PERSON> Allason </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>'s recollection of a British intelligence official taking classified files with him when he retired. The traitor's aim, <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> thinks, was to show once again that secret British files are not leakproof. Apart from all this is the question of what possessed this epitome of the English gentry to devote himself to communism and treachery. Author <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Muggeridge </PERSON>, once a close friend, blamed the double agent's father <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>, the celebrated explorer and expert in Arabic. `` <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> could never be the towering figure his father was, so he compensated for it by defying him and all he stood for in the most appalling manner,'' <PERSON> Muggeridge </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>. He called <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> `` a cad's cad.'' <PERSON> Allason </PERSON> called him `` a grotesquely unpleasant man who betrayed everyone he came in contact with, including his close friends and family.'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and raised in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, wrote that he felt little conventional English patriotism. He said he embraced communism at <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was not challenging German militarism, and communism alone seemed to offer resistance. An editorial in the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> said he deserved only contempt. `` The convention whereby the dead should be judged charitably demands suspension in the case of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>,'' it said. `` He has died impenitent, glorying in his own treason.''

<TEXT>
 Soldiers closed Arab schools months ago, but children are back in class, reciting lessons in unfinished buildings, mosques and churches with the added spice of defying the Israeli occupiers. About 60 youngsters aged 6 to 12 study math, English, Arabic, history and geography in bedrooms of an incomplete villa on a rocky hillside _ peering out during the multiplication tables, as children do, at yellow flowers in the valley. Secret schools are different, and to many students an adventure. The children do not have to wear uniforms, classes are coeducational, and some children from private Moslem and Christian schools are studying together. The army closed all 820 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools Feb. 2, sending home 300,000 elementary and secondary students. Schools in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> have been closed for days at a time, but the army has not shut down the entire system. Israeli officials said schools had become assembly points for the anti-Israeli rebellion that began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Leaflets issued this week by the uprising's clandestine leadership urge more secret schools to get started. Those already operating include half a dozen in <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zeit </LOCATION>, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The underground schools symbolize the transformation of the 5-month-old revolt, which has claimed the lives of 186 Arabs and two Israelis. There is far less street violence now, but the air of defiance is little diminished. Teachers and students interviewed at the `` people's schools'' agreed that challenging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s authority was a significant reason for organizing the classes. `` Because the Israelis closed the schools, we come here to show that we can break their rules,'' said <PERSON> Amjad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shibli </PERSON>, 16. His school `` uniform'' was brown jeans and yellow and black running shoes. <PERSON> Amjad </PERSON> was among about 75 teen-agers attending high school classes in an unfinished building behind the city hall. He said he had spent the past three months working in his father's cafe and sometimes joined other youths in throwing stones at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Rocks intended to slow Israeli vehicles are scattered in streets leading to the makeshift high school. The pavement near another school had been blackened by bonfires of tires burned as protest barricades. The military government, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, closed four universities as well as the lower schools because many protests began on the campuses. `` Schools were closed because the children did n't want to study. They had become a place for disturbances and violence,'' said <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabovitch </PERSON>, a spokesman for army administration. He said protests had decreased dramatically in recent weeks and the schools might be allowed to reopen if the situation remained calm. An <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> teacher who identified himself only as Professor <PERSON> M. </PERSON> said: `` The Israelis have kept the schools closed as a general punishment of the population.'' He is a lecturer at the shuttered <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and organized most of the underground schools that opened here two weeks ago. Thirty-seven parents, university graduates and laid-off university teachers were recruited to conduct classes for several hundred volunteer students in <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zeit </LOCATION>, Professor <PERSON> M. </PERSON> said. He said regular teachers, who are <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> employees, refused to help because <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities threatened to dismiss them. Professor M. acknowledged `` an element of challenge'' to the army in organizing the schools, but he and other teachers said their main concern was seeing that the children did not fall too far behind in their studies. Although many classes are coeducational, some Moslem families send their children to study in mosques, where boys attend in the morning and girls in the afternoon. At the unfinished villa on the hill, <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayegh </PERSON>, a 26-year-old economics graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was teaching math to 14 pupils aged aged 8 and 9 who sat in small chairs against the unpainted concrete walls. His blackboard and textbooks were spirited from the government school. <PERSON> Sayegh </PERSON> said the youngsters were taught the politics of the `` intefadeh,'' or uprising, but a reporter saw no evidence of indoctrination in the classes visited. `` The government wants to keep the Palestinian people empty-headed,'' <PERSON> Sayegh </PERSON> said. `` That way Palestinians ca n't make bombs or fly airplanes. They want all the knowledge for themselves so Palestinians ca n't destroy the Jewish government.''

 Two Iranian factions clashed Thursday during a demonstration against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and three Iranians were stabbed, police said.

Fighting broke out after about 40 demonstrators, some carrying pictures of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, gathered in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>'s central square to protest Israeli policy. A group of anti-Khomeini activists arrived and the rival groups shouted slogans at each other. Fighting broke out despite the presence of police on horseback and in riot gear. The Swedish national news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> said about 100 demonstrators gathered outside a <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> hospital after the clash to protest the stabbings.

<HEAD>Dip in Clean-Living Index Shows Need to Push Health Habits:

 The first decline in an annual index of American health practices illustrates there is a big difference between people knowing they should eat right and exercise and actually doing it, authorities said Thursday. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, a federal health official, said the drop underscores the need for leaders `` to redouble our efforts to convince Americans that health promotion ideas are not a fad.'' Despite extensive publicity in recent years about the value of proper diet and exercise, the 1988 survey by Prevention magazine showed few gains in those areas, <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION>, noted. In particular, he told reporters it is `` an issue of some concern that we have n't seen improvement'' in the number of people who told pollsters they `` try a lot to avoid eating too much fat.'' Only 54 percent answered `` yes'' to that question, down from 56 percent in the 1987 report. The latest result also is down from the 55 percent who gave a `` yes'' response in polling done for the initial index in 1984. The overall 1988 Prevention Index stood at 64.8 out of a possible 100 _ down from 65.2 last year but 3.3 points above the first index in 1984. However, the overall gain from 1984 is due largely to sharp jumps in the number of people who have smoke detectors in their homes, a 15 percent jump; and the number who report wearing auto seatbelts, a 38 percent climb. <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> complimented the commercial magazine for compiling the index, noting that is the only survey that has tracked trends in 21 specific areas over a five-year period. `` One clear message from this year's survey is that the spread of good health habits is not automatic,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dybdahl </PERSON>, director of the Prevention Index. `` People may know more than ever about good health, but they may not be acting on what they know. In key areas such as diet, exercise and weight control, there is still much room for improvement.'' For example, the number saying they are making efforts to limit high-cholesterol foods fell from 46 percent in the 1987 report to 42 percent this year, the same as it was in 1984. Compared with 1984, there was a two-percentage-point drop in the number who said they try to avoid too many sweets and three-point decline in the number who said they get seven or eight hours sleep most nights. Although up two points from the 1984 report, only 35 percent of Americans say they exercise strenuously three or more days a week and only 24 percent say they are at their proper weight, up one point from 1984. Seventy-two percent say they do not smoke, the same as last year and up two points from 1984. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which conducts the poll that forms the basis for the index, described the figures on diet and nutrition as `` amazingly flat'' from a statistical viewpoint. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the lack of significant improvement in the diet and exercise portions of the five-year survey show a gap between `` lip service and good intentions'' and actual practice. Weight control is `` a truly dismal story,'' he said, noting that 76 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> think they are overweight. `` We remain the most obese country in the world,'' he said. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> pollsters ask the same questions each year to give an accurate year-to-year comparison. The current year's report was based on telephone interviews conducted with 1,250 randomly selected adults Nov. 11-25 and has a 3 percent margin of error. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> acknowledged that the typically small year-to-year changes registered in the survey often fall within the margin of error. However, he said the theoretical chance for error is largely overriden because consistent trends tracked over the five-year sampling period give added credence to the figures reported in any one year. The single-number Prevention Index itself is derived by assigning weights to each of the 21 survey questions and applying poll results to that relative value scale. For example, not smoking is assigned the highest ranking _ 9.78 on a scale of one to 10.

<BYLINE>Hypnosis Blocks Pain By Changing Brain's Functioning, Study
Suggests

 People who can make their hands go numb through hypnosis show a marked change in brain waves, suggesting that a trance blocks pain by altering the brain's processing of information, a new study says. Hypnotized people who create a pain-blocking hallucination may essentially be reducing the signal on normal sensory circuits and turning instead to imagination-linked circuits, said researcher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>. `` These findings provide evidence for the objective as well as subjective reality'' of hypnotic hallucinations that affect the sense of feel, <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Hypnosis is a state of aroused and concentrated attention, similar to getting lost in a good book. Scientists have known for a century that hypnotism can reduce pain, but they do not know how. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said the new findings provide a starting point for further exploration of the cause. He and two <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> colleagues studied 10 highly hypnotizable people and 10 with little ability to enter a trance. The brain waves were studied while a series of electrical impulses, not quite strong enough to cause discomfort, was applied to their left wrists. Each person went through the experience four times. Without hypnosis, they were told at one time to simply pay attention to what they felt, and at another time to press a button when they felt slightly longer pulses. Another time, after a procedure to induce a trance, they were told again to push a button when they felt the longer pulses. The fourth time, they were put into a trance and told to imagine that a local anesthetic was spreading from the fingers of their left hand up through the forearm. They were told to make the arm cold, tingling and numb. Then they were told to press the button if they felt any long electrical pulses. The hallucination was more effective in the highly hypnotizable subjects, who pushed the button after only 38 percent of the long pulses, than in the low hypnotizables, who felt 80 percent of the long pulses. Without the hallucination, both groups responded to 86 percent or more of the long pulses either with or without hypnosis. The brain waves studied are called `` cortical event-related potentials,'' which reflect the brain's reponse to a stimulus. When researchers looked at the behavior of brain waves about a tenth of a second after each electrical impulse, they found that in highly hypnotizable people, the hallucination reduced brain wave strength by about 45 percent from the level seen without hypnosis. In contrast, when the highly hypnotizable people were asked under hypnosis to pay attention to the impulses, but not create the numbness in their arm, the wave strength at the one-tenth second mark rose 35 percent over the level without hypnosis. Brain waves in the low hypnotizables showed no such changes. The flexibility that the highly hypnotizable people showed in adjusting the sensory input in the brain fits in well with the ability of such people to reduce or eliminate pain with hypnosis, <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said. The results are `` a very interesting finding,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>, psychiatrist in chief at <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and psychiatry professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Previous work has shown brain wave differences in visual hallucinations, he said Thursday in a telephone interview.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is discussing a deal that could result in the dropping of drug trafficking charges against Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in exchange for his agreement to relinquish power, a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today. `` We're still talking'' about such a deal, said chief presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` What this amounts to is a plea bargain,'' he said. However, the spokesman said no direct negotiations have taken place with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on the matter. Pressed at a briefing later to spell out the legal and other ramifications of such a deal in this country, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I offer no definition of plea bargaining.'' `` I'm not going to speculate on possibilities that we do n't know are going to happen,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> did say, however, that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not talked to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` The president obviously has directed the negotiations that have gone on there, but I wo n't go further,'' the spokesman said. `` Negotiations are continuing, with no agreements reached.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, whose office is prosecuting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, met with Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> left the building without talking to reporters and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declined comment. A department source said before the meeting that the two men were expected to discuss the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> case. Earlier, White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, without actually confirming an offer, told <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> that if such an arrangement got <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power, `` that would be the most fruitful and productive plea bargain that we have seen in a long time.'' Reports of an offer brought sharp criticism today from several senators and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s anti-Noriega ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Administration sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> drug-trafficking indictments against the de facto Panamanian ruler would be dropped if he stepped down and left the country for a year. The sources said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> objected to the offer, which was approved at a White House meeting. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said if descriptions of the offer were accurate, it would appear to be a victory for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, allowing his loyalists to retain control while he spent `` a year's vacation on the <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>. `` If I was a cop in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> or somewhere, I'd sit there and say this administration has sent a signal that crime does pay,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said on the CBS show. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> such such a deal would be `` a mistake and even an insult to the efforts of this country to fight a war on drugs.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alphonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said, `` I think it'd be a terrible mistake to take the word of a drug-dealing killer dictator that he's going to get out and allow free elections sometime next year, and he'd be allowed to stay in until August. And the only thing you're going to have is a transferance of power to his cronies.'' `` For us to be saying that we can trust this man to keep his word is naive,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said. `` We can only consider dropping the indictment after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leaves <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with his henchmen and with the proviso that President <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> take over and provide for free elections.'' Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, appearing on the CBS program, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opponents can not accept the dropping of charges without any arrangements made for next year's election, the restructuring of the defense forces <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> controls or the setting up of a government of reconciliation. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> also said the obvious differences among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials on how to handle <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> have only helped him. He said if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is to leave, he should leave now and not wait until August, which reportedly would be part of the arrangement between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The reported offer is the latest in a series of administration efforts since February, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions, that have paralyzed the Panamanian economy but have so far not succeeded in ousting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The administration had offered previously not to extradite <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on the drug trafficking charges if he went into political exile. A Panamanian government spokesman said in response to word of the new offer Wednesday night, `` There has been no agreement about anything.'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s official news agency, Panapress, reported Wednesday night that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had `` entered in direct contact with General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' but gave no details. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has sent a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoy in recent weeks to talk with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman would not comment when asked whether the envoy met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or his representatives Wednesday. The news agency said: `` General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has said there can be no deal if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aggression and the violation of Panamanian sovereignty continue.'' An administration source said Wednesday that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> accepts the deal, he would step down probably in August and would stay out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> until after the next presidential elections there in 1990. The deal was approved Tuesday at a White House meeting over the objections of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, the source said. <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said he was aware of the proposed deal but did not know any details. `` I was informed that an offer was being made,'' said <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, reached by telephone at his <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office. `` I have no knowledge of anything else.'' In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the government said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had not agreed to step down. `` There has been no agreement about anything,'' said <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, director of the government's National Information System. `` Such reports only come from sources interested in sidetracking the conversations and in aggravating the existing situation.'' Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> early last week and has been conferring there with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his representatives ever since, sources said. `` The situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has many aspects and no agreement has yet been reached,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said Wednesday night. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was charged in a 12-count indictment unsealed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> last Feb. 5 with taking at least $ 4.6 million in payoffs from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s violent <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel to protect cocaine shipments, launder money, supply drug laboratories and shelter the gang's leaders from law enforcement A separate three-count indictment unsealed the same day in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of conspiracy to import, distribute and attempt to import more than 1 million pounds of marijuana. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorneys, said he knew nothing about the proposal to drop the indictments as part of a deal to end <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis, but said he was not surprised by the reports. `` The dismissal of the indictment is something that I have always insisted would be a prerequisite to any negotiation,'' he said. NBC News, quoting an unidentified American official, said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decided to support the proposal after <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> advisers warned that further delay in getting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out could lead to a political alliance between <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>.

 A holdout juror at the center of a controversy over the verdict in the nation's first death-by-tampering trial has admitted that she herself was involved in an earlier tampering case, according to a report published today. Juror <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that she sued after she bit into a cracker that contained an aspirin substitute and settled the case out of court only two months before she became a juror in the cyanide case. She said she never told court officers of her own case before she became involved in the trial of <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, who was convicted Monday of killing her husband and another person with tainted Extra-Strength Excedrin. Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, the focus of a jury tampering investigation being pushed by Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s attorney, has admitted to being the holdout juror who broke an 11-1 deadlock on Monday when she changed her vote. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, was convicted on five counts of product tampering and faces a June 17 sentencing in the deaths of her husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>. She faces life imprisonment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> has already ordered the panel to come back to court Friday, at the request of the defense, to determine whether the verdict was tainted by outside influece. Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> that she got a telephone call last Friday, while the jury was deliberating, from an anonymous caller who told her that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had failed an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> lie detector test. She told <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> the call would not affect her vote and <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> allowed her to remain on the jury until it reached a verdict. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> poisoned her husband to collect his insurance, then put tainted painkillers on a store shelf to divert suspicion from herself, according to the prosecution. She faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. In an interview in today's <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, confirmed that she was the holdout in a series of 11-1 votes during five days of deliberations, as indicated earlier by lawyers and other jurors. The Times said that in her own tampering incident, Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> told police her mouth started burning after eating a cracker on July 31, 1986. She found half of an ibuprofen pill in the uneaten portion of the cracker, called poison control and vomited, she said. Ibuprofen is an aspirin substitute commonly used in over-the-counter pain relievers. A year later, Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> sued the manufacturer of Goldfish crackers, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The case was assigned to arbitration and settled out of court for $ 500. There were no witnesses and <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> attorneys questioned whether the event ever took place. Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> said she did n't tell the judge or attorneys about the incident during juror screening because she did n't think it was important. In her interview with the Post-Intelligencer, Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> denied defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s suggestions that she might have fabricated the report to be excused from deliberations or that another juror might have made the call. `` He is playing his last cards in a desperate attempt to save his client,'' Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, a real estate agent, told <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> before the verdict Monday that a female voice she did not recognize told her Friday night that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had failed an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> lie-detector test _ a fact that had not been admitted as evidence in court. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> let her stay on the jury after she said the call would n't influence her deliberations, and <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> concurred at the time But on Tuesday, after the verdict and learning about the 11-1 votes, <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> filed a motion asking for permission to question the 12 jurors individually. And on Wednesday, <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said `` The court is required by law to investigate one way or the other'' whether there was jury tampering. `` It can not let the matter sit.'' However, he emphasized that he was `` not suggesting in the slightest any misconduct by any juror.'' He told <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> and assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> to submit questions to him. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said he would question the jurors under oath. In the newspaper interview, Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> expressed skepticism that the anonymous caller could have been another juror. `` I really resent the implication about the truth of the other jurors,'' she said. `` Hundreds of people knew who the jurors were, and my name happens to be in the -LRB- telephone -RRB- book.'' Names of the jurors were broadcast and published only after the trial but were given in court during jury selection and were available from the court clerk during the trial. Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> said she had no need to fabricate the report because had she wanted to be excused from the panel, she said, `` I could have called in sick.''

<TEXT>
 Soviet media once branded <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> a traitor, but a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> weekly has now provided a sympathetic portrait of the human rights activist and his wife. This week's issue of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> long ago understood the need for change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the past charges leveled at <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and his wife, fellow dissident <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News also pointedly notes that the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner has praised <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for social and economic reform. The 66-year-old <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and his wife lead a frugal existence in their seventh-floor <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment, eating cabbage, beet soup, potatoes and other simple fare, and <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> insists on washing the dishes afterward himself, the paper said. It said their two-room home was always filled with people seeking <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s aid, and that the words most often heard there are: `` Help me.'' But <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News asked: `` Can he really do everything?'' Although the full-page article was the longest on <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> to date in the Soviet press, it made only indirect reference to the nearly seven years he spent in exile after criticizing the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, a brilliant physicist, was allowed to return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in December 1986 from his forced residence in the closed city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>, where he was banished without trial in January 1980. `` In effect, sometimes <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> bitterly jokes that he'd like to return to Gorky for a few months to be able to work alone on scientific work,'' <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Of course, concerning <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>, that's a bitter joke.'' Since his return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has been a vocal supporter of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program for nationwide reforms that includes the policy of `` glasnost,'' or greater openness on selected topics. `` He simply believes that something helped change the thoughts of the majority into state policy,'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News said. `` He calls perestroika -LRB- restructuring -RRB- an enormous event for our country and for the entire world. However, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has insisted on speedier progress in improving the Soviet record on human rights, and during a Jan. 15 meeting in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, he handed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a list of 200 people he said were imprisoned for their views. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News noted that in 1975, in a tract titled `` Knowledge and the World,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> set forth his views on Soviet affairs. Those writings have not been published in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Now we can definitely see parallels between what he said then, and those ideas that we are putting forward today,'' <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> called for a ban on nuclear testing long before the Kremlin. The human rights activist, one of the most prominent members of the dissident movement that reached its peak in the 1970s, sought openness in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> society years before `` glasnost'' became Communist Party policy. Much of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News article seemed designed to undo harm caused to the Sakharovs by previous press campaigns against them. It said one Soviet book accused the Sakharovs of living in `` oriental luxury'' and engaging in `` scandals between spouses.'' <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was stubborn, unassuming, an undisputed member of his country's intelligentsia and a man with his own views on how to deal conscientiously with world affairs and the demands of this life. His strong convictions even extend to his insistence that he do the dishes after meals, wrote the reporter who visited <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> at his apartment. `` What is that, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Dmitrievich </PERSON>, your hobby?'' asked <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News correspondent <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhavoronkov </PERSON>. `` Not all guests are able to wash the dishes conscientiously,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> replied.

 <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, the chubby-cheeked tot who smiled despite adversity, won the hearts of many, and her supporters say her fight following a historic five-organ transplant reveals more about life and courage than about medicine. `` Through her, God touched the world,'' her uncle, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, said Thursday. `` He said: ` Look, y' all think you got problems, well look at this girl Look what she has done.' It brought the highest and the lowest people together for just a minute.'' <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>, 3 -LCB-, of <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, died Wednesday afternoon in the intensive care unit of <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> after an infection in her bloodstream caused her heart, kidneys and liver to fail. The 36-pound, pigtailed child was the world's longest survivor of a five-organ transplant. She received a new liver, small intestines, pancreas and parts of a stomach and colon during a 15-hour experimental operation that ended Nov. 1. Similar procedures had been performed only twice before, and both patients died within a few days. `` You could n't help but love that little girl. So many of us learned so much from her and not just medically,'' said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> was never down,'' she said. `` When people ask if the operation was a success, it's hard to measure success. It was a success because <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> lived six additional months and there were good times.'' Because of an intestinal deformity, doctors had been forced to remove 95 percent of <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s small bowel three days after she was born. She was placed on a highly concentrated liquid diet, which damaged her own liver. Doctors had said <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> would soon die without the transplant. She was hospitalized for all but seven weeks of her life and though she said she craved pizza, the only solid food she ever ate was rice cereal, Ms. <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> won the affection of hospital staff with good-natured teasing, playing peek-a-boo and singing `` The Itsy-Bitsy Spider.'' She walked through hospital halls with an intravenous pole in tow, wearing her cherished tennis shoes and chatting with anyone. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s hospital room was empty Thursday. The countless stuffed animals, `` tons and tons'' of cards and a photo of a puppy recently given to <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> have been packed in boxes, Ms. <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said. `` I think it's affected everybody in the hospital from housekeeping on up. At every level heartstrings are being pulled,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, quickly checked out of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where they had stayed for months. Ms. <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said they did not want their whereabouts known Thursday as they prepared to leave for home. Other family members gathered in <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, waiting for the parents to join them and remembering <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>. `` She had those fat jaws and was always smiling,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 33, said in a telephone interview. `` She was a survivor. She was a fighter.'' <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s aunt, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> East </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said the child taught her to have faith. `` She taught me to endure because she did,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> East </PERSON> said the family was grateful the transplant kept <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> alive for a time. `` They gave her another day,'' she said. `` It just gave us more time with her.'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said it was amazing <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> won the affection of people like President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who had mentioned <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s plight in a national radio address in January and contributed $ 1,000 toward her medical expenses. Well-wishers from around the country, including <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, donated more than $ 350,000 to help cover medical expenses for <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>. Much of the money came from black churches. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> was black. `` <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> showed us that courage and strength come in all sizes,'' <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, under Republican attack for lacking foreign policy experience, exchanged warm words with Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Thursday and criticized reported <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> dealing to drop drug charges against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, before heading west to campaign for primaries in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, also made the rounds among Democrats on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, winning the endorsement of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and praise from other leaders. On <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, he said, `` I think before we start talking about dropping indictments and making deals, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people deserve a full explanation of what kind of relationship this administration has had with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. ... Just exactly what has been going on for the past 7 -LCB- years? `` I do n't believe you drop indictments against suspected drug runners and murderers,'' he said at the Capitol. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> began his day by meeting with <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> in private, focusing news media coverage on foreign policy, an area that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has portrayed as a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> weakness. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> discussed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legislation that would toughen trade sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including a requirement that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies get rid of investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> later told reporters he supports the legislation `` very strongly.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> told reporters he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had no points of disagreement. `` I do n't think we need to give an endorsement, but we know we would be amongst friends and we would have very, very powerful friends in the White House if we had a Democrat occupying the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. `` I know that our people back home would be very delighted to have a change in the White House.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> for showing courage and leadership, and said, `` It's time to change our policy and I assure you if all goes well ... there will be a fundamental change in policy. This country has got to lead in human rights.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said, `` God bless you.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with a big lead in delegates, talked with congressional Democrats in meetings that were in keeping with his role as the party's expected presidential nominee. While he won warm words from those who appeared with him after their meetings, the get-acquainted sessions underscored that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as a three-term governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, is something of a stranger on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Besides <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, he won the endorsement of Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> chairman, who called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` the candidate best able to lead our nation. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., who had backed <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> before he dropped out of the presidential race, praised <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for signaling he values cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> But <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he was n't endorsing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, citing his role as parliamentarian of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> and saying he wished to remain neutral. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> emerged from a private meeting with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and offered his endorsement to the candidate who just two days earlier won overwhelmingly in the primary in <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s home state, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` I do it without any reservations because I'm confident, based on our conversation, we're going to have a president who will work with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` I feel in the interest of party unity and with the progress Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has shown ... we need now to begin to close ranks, and that's what we're doing today,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said.

 Dubbed `` Delta Duke,'' Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> took to the roads and to the airwaves Thursday pushing a $ 1 billion bond to unclog the nation's most congested roads. `` Today the governor is a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> commuter and a traffic tipster,'' said anchorman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorn </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> KNX-AM </ORGANIZATION>, one of three radio stations to broadcast <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s live traffic reports. During his hourlong, 32-mile commute from a hotel near his <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> home to <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, the governor crept through the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> junction of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> freeways, which traffic officials have labeled the nation's busiest interchange. Some 513,000 vehicles use it daily. The Republican governor wanted to demonstrate how <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s freeways, once the idyllic image of wide-open roadways ideal for cruising, are now the nation's busiest Transportation officials confirmed this week that nine of the nation's 10 busiest freeway interchanges are in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` Just traveling along now on the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeway </ORGANIZATION>, I'm taking note of the fact there's only one person in each car. If we can just increase that to 1.4 persons, we can relieve congestion during the peak traffic hours,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> traveled in a telephone-equipped van, provided by the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, to a transportation hearing to dramatize his support for a $ 1 billion bond issue on the June 7 ballot. Proposition 74 is the first phase of a $ 2.3 billion package of supplemental financing for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> highway improvements which <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> first proposed two years ago. He averaged 35 mph during the commute, but slowed to 5 mph at one point where the Century Freeway is being constructed near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` We are approaching the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> exit. We're almost at a standstill, moving 5 mph,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> KNX-AM </ORGANIZATION> traffic reporter <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> the handle `` Delta Duke'' for his traffic reporting stint, which was also heard on <ORGANIZATION> KABC-AM </ORGANIZATION> and KGIL-AM. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> laughed, saying, `` Well, I've been called a lot worse.'' Hundreds of thousands of people move to the nation's second-largest city each year Roadway congestion became so bad last summer that flare-ups among commuters resulted in a rash of freeway shootings killing five and wounding 11. `` I'm aware of the frustration people have in the peak hours,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> transportation officials who worked with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said this week that six of the country's 10 busiest interchanges are in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Two of the other top 10 spots were claimed by neighboring <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` I looked at the numbers and said, ` Holy mackerel!''' said transportation engineer <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Pivetti </PERSON>. `` Ten years ago, all the top spots would have been in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Now we have nearly all the spots. We're talking about some tremendous volumes of traffic.'' Behind the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> freeway junction is the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> interchange of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> freeways, with 509,000 vehicles per day, and the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> junction with the <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with 502,500 vehicles per day. The point where the <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> freeways meet in <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION> claimed the fourth busiest spot with 480,000 cars per day. The junction of the Eastshore, <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> and Nimitz freeways in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> placed fifth in the congestion lineup because it serves 455,000 vehicles per day. Another 444,000 drivers use the junction of the <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> freeways in <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION>, making it the sixth busiest interchange in the country. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, Garden Grove and Orange freeways in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> took seventh place with 441,000 vehicles a day, while the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riverside </ORGANIZATION> freeways in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> claimed ninth place with 421,000 vehicles a day. Both are in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The eighth spot was claimed by the <LOCATION> Artesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> freeways in <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where 425,500 vehicles a day pass through.

<TEXT>
 A truce ordered by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> ended a six-day battle between rival militias Thursday in which the radical <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> captured most of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Shiite Moslem slums. Sniper fire was heard in the ramshackle 16 square miles adjacent to the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport, but the howitzers and tank cannons were silent. Police reported a woman killed and two other civilians wounded in the <LOCATION> Ghobeiri </LOCATION> neighborhood. Police said 188 people were killed and 534 wounded in the battle that began last Friday between the mainstream <LOCATION> Amal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> militia </LOCATION>, backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which is loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. South of the capital, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> air force blasted <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> bases in its eighth raid into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Police said six fighter-bombers made three passes to rocket targets near <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION>, 16 miles from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries. The truce was ordered for 11 p.m. Wednesday after telephone conversations between President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, spiritual leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, said he had no information about the 18 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, most of whom are believed held in the slums by groups linked to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. There has been no word of the foreigners, who include nine Americans, since the fighting began. Although its fighting force was outnumbered 2-1, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> appeared to have won the contest for supremacy. Police said it controlled 70 percent of the slums when the fighting ended, compared with about one-third when it began. Police estimated <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s fighting force at 3,000 men. They said <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> put about 6,500 men into the field, about 2,000 brought in from the Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 25,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and sent 7,500 of them to Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in February 1987 to stop factional war. Although they patrol west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the Syrians have not entered the southern Shiite slums. After 13 years of civil war, <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> was the undisputed power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> began challenging Syrian influence among the 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> denied police reports that 500 Iranian Revolutionary Guards joined them in the slum war. A police spokesman said <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> lost `` most'' of its positions in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He said Amal moved its fighters to the edges of the disputed area and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> took over the inner neighborhoods. Most of the 250,000 people who normally live in the southern slums fled during the battle and more were planning to go despite the truce. `` We do n't trust cease-fires,'' a man who identified himself only as <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> told a reporter. `` I have five children and I've already lost my home I do n't know where to go now. I do n't think the fighting will ever stop unless one side exterminates the other.'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> spoke with journalists at his home, which was damaged by artillery fire, in the Haret Hreik neighborhood. `` I think it's over now because of the high-level solutions that are being worked out by the presidents of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' he said Asked about the foreigners, he replied: `` I have no information about the hostages and I do n't know anything about them. I do n't know where they are and, therefore, I ca n't answer your question. He called <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> `` a local force that represents <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests in the area.'' Posters stuck on walls in districts <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> had conquered depicted <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s justice minister and the <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> leader, with vampire teeth over the slogan: `` The war criminal who sold himself to the Great Satan,'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s standard term for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Iranian flags were hoisted on positions formerly held by <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>. A four-man committee was formed to supervise the cease-fire, under which the combatants were to withdraw from the streets and free prisoners by Friday. Its members are Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheikoleslam </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>; Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s intelligence chief in west Beiut, and one representative each of Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>: <PERSON> Ayoub </PERSON> <PERSON> Homayed </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>.

 An explosion spewed flaming metal chips throughout an industrial plant Thursday, killing one worker and injuring eight others, officials said. Businesses near the plant on the city's east side were evacuated while firefighters worked to keep flames from spreading to a warehouse containing powdered metals, including magnesium, titanium and aluminum. `` The dust collector blew up and spread these flaming metal chips and debris all over and started the fire,'' said Fire Chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON>. Firefighters found one worker's body in the <ORGANIZATION> Mineral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plant after the fire was brought under control about noon, three hours after it was reported. The victim's identity was not immediately available. Plant secretary <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobola </PERSON> said there were 29 people in the plant when the explosion occurred. The plant processes powdered metal into a substance for welding rod coatings, workers said. Ms. <PERSON> Sobola </PERSON> said her office filled with dust and she ran out a side door. She said workers were `` just running out and collapsing outside the doors.'' Ms. <PERSON> Sobola </PERSON> said there have been minor explosions at the plant in the past that have spread dust throughout the plant. `` I knew this time -LRB- it was worse -RRB-.

 Depressed teen-agers intent on killing themselves show chemical abnormalities in their brains that appear to predispose them to suicide, according to a study released Thursday. `` It clearly demonstrates some brain differences in suicidal adolescents. It's not purely a mind phenomenon,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, assistant professor of psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier studies have found similar abnormalities in the brains of suicidal adults, although experts are divided as to what conclusions can be drawn. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s research is believed to be the first that demonstrates neurochemical abnormalities in suicidal adolescents. `` What this suggests is that there is a biochemical basis to at least depressive people with chronic suicidal plans,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. `` There's something that goes on with the brain and there are environmental phenomena that impinge on that.'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said his findings, reported at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual conference in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, could help doctors identify and treat certain patients before they try to commit suicide. <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> Lann </PERSON>, a science administrator in child and adolescent disorders research for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s work is preliminary, and further study is needed. `` It's premature to even think that we could be able to identify groups of suicidal adolescents,'' she said. Of the 29,453 suicides in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1985, the last year for which figures are available, 2,127 were committed by youngsters 19 and under, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. About 80 percent of them were boys. Boys and girls are afflicted about equally by depression. But while more girls attempt suicide, more boys succeed at it, according to <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Puig-Antich </PERSON>, professor of psychiatry at <LOCATION> Pitt </LOCATION>, began their study in 1980 at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. They continued their work, funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, after moving in 1984 to <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. From 1980 to 1987, the psychiatrists monitored the growth hormone secretion of 140 boys and girls ranging in age from 12 to just under 18. The tests were conducted while the subjects slept. Most growth hormone secretion occurs during sleep, especially during the first several hours, according to <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. At least three neurotransmitter systems in the brain are involved in controlling sleep growth hormone secretion, which also affects moods. The 34 youngsters who suffered from major depression and had attempted suicide or devised a suicide plan secreted less growth hormone than the 40 depressed but non-suicidal students and 66 healthy children, whose levels were about the same, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. The subjects' sex was not a factor, and their ages were taken into account. Later, 43 of the students received a one-time shot of Desipramine, an antidepressant known to stimulate the release of growth hormone. Among the eight depressed, suicidal youths who received the shot, less growth hormone was released than among the 12 depressed but non-suicidal and 23 healthy adolescents, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said.

 The federal government should direct its efforts to providing health care for the chronically ill, says the new president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>. `` We contend that national legislation based on a social insurance approach is required so that the risk can be spread over millions of working and retired persons,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Crooks </PERSON>, 76, who ascended to the presidency Wednesday during the biannual meeting of the 28 million-member association. `` We must find a way to assure adequate health care for the estimated 37 million Americans, who have no health care insurer whatsoever, and expand and improve private pension plans so that future generations of older Americans will have more adequate retirement income,'' the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, woman said. Among the health issues discussed at the convention was Alzheimer's disease, a form of dementia that afflicts about 2 million elderly Americans. The disease's cure and cause remains unknown. Dr. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, director of the Program on Aging at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said the federal government is spending $ 90 million a year to research the disease, up from $ 4 million in 1974. `` Alzheimer's has emerged as one of the great mysteries of medical science,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. The conference also looked at the needs of those who care for the elderly. Those people, mostly women, often are burdened by unrelenting demands and develop health problems of their own, said <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gerontology </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. She said twice as many senior citizens are being cared for in private homes as in nursing homes.

 The first new `` Tonight Show'' since the writers' strike started two months ago was a sight for sore eyes for millions of viewers who boosted the show's ratings by 36 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Host <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, who is not a member of the striking <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, got back on the air by writing his own material, beginning with Wednesday night's show. According to overnight ratings from the country's 16 largest television markets, `` Tonight'' got a rating of 8.7 and a 27 share on Wednesday night, a 36 percent rise over its average rating since the strike began. The rating is a percentage of homes with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The 2-month-old strike over royalties and creative control forced reruns of `` The Tonight Show Starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'' and `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>,'' both on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, and caused an early end of the season for some series. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has announced it is delaying the start of its fall season due to the strike.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Declares U.S. Sentencing Commission Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has declared unconstitutional a commission that sets federal sentencing guidelines, saying the president's authority to remove commission members violates the separation of powers between the executive and judiciary branches of government. Chief <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brevard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hand </ORGANIZATION> also threw out the sentencing guidelines themselves. Hand's ruling Wednesday on a motion in a cocaine case was similar to one issued by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoob </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; challenges to the guidelines also have been filed in other jurisdictions and many federal judges have criticized them. Under the commission's guidelines, federal judges must impose sentences within prescribed ranges unless special circumstances exist that are not adequately considered by the commission's rules. The guidelines, <ORGANIZATION> Hand </ORGANIZATION> said, substantially restrict the traditional discretion allowed judges in sentencing. Hand said the commission, created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, improperly includes three federal judges. Members of the commission are appointed by the president and may be removed by him for neglect of duty, malfeasance in office or for other causes. `` Federal courts must carefully abstain from exercising any power that is not strictly judicial in its character, and which is not clearly confided by the Constitution,'' Hand ruled. He said the job of setting guidelines is essentially an administrative rule-making task, legislative in nature, and `` not a proper function of the judiciary.''

 Singer <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a three-time Grammy winner, says she has come to terms with her late father's fame and now wants to do an album of Nat `` King'' Cole ballads. Miss Cole successfully battled drug and alcohol dependence in the early 1980s with the help of a therapist and overcame her hostility toward her father, according to the May 30 issue of Us magazine. `` My whole theme was, ` I'll never be as good as my father,''' Miss <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. She said the time was right to record her father's songs `` because I have confidence in my own talent. Miss Cole, who is riding high with a hit single `` Pink Cadillac,'' was frank about her problems. `` I was a human garbage disposal,'' she said, speaking of her years on cocaine, methaqualone and alcohol. Then, after her rehabilitation, `` people wanted to know if I could stay sober. Then they wanted to know if I could still sing. It was humiliating and scary and just plain hard work, but I proved that I could do both.''

<HEAD>House Votes To Make Itself More Immune To Civil Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House unanimously approved a resolution Thursday that asserts the right of its members to be immune from civil lawsuits when they issue news releases, hold news conferences or communicate with government officials. The 413-0 vote was triggered by a federal appeals court decision that limited lawmakers' immunity to activities such as speaking and voting on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. The resolution requested that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hear an appeal of the case, in which the need for a broader interpretation of immunity would be argued. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> expressed `` deep concern'' with the ruling `` because of its impact on the necessary and proper functioning of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>.'' The dispute began in 1985 when Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundquist </PERSON>, R-Tenn., wrote to the attorney general and the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> about a controversy over expenditure of federal money by <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Sundquist </PERSON>, who released the letters to the news media, made a reference to a staff attorney for the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> group, who sued the lawmaker for defamation of character. In April 1986, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> dismissed the suit on grounds that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are entitled to immunity while acting in good faith within the scope of their official duties. Last November, a panel of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> voted 2-1 to reverse the ruling. The appellate court said immunity was limited to that granted by the Constitution's speech and debate clause, which has been held to apply only to activities such as floor action <PERSON> Sundquist </PERSON> then appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Expert Testifies Train Crew Lacked Sleep Before Fatal Accident</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YORK, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> crew members in a fatal train accident suffered from a lack of sleep and could have dozed off while still instinctively performing basic duties, an industrial psychologist testified Thursday. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tepas </PERSON>, professor of psychology and director of the industrial and organizational psychology program at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION>, said the three crew members on each of the two trains suffered from `` chronic sleep deprivation.'' <PERSON> Tepas </PERSON> testified during the second day of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing on the Jan. 14 train accident in <LOCATION> Thompsontown </LOCATION>, which killed four people. The two <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> trains, one hauling coal and the other carrying trailer-vans, smashed head-on at about 8 a.m., killing the engineer and the brakeman on both trains and derailing all five locomotives. Damage was estimated at $ 5 million. <PERSON> Tepas </PERSON> said the rail employee's erratic work schedules; harsh, monotonous work environment; and a lack of programs to help employees deal with job stress promote sleeping on the job. `` Work systems which result in night work, shifts of unusual length and unpredictable work hours result in conditions which place workers and the general public at risk,'' he said in prepared testmony. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>, a private freight rail organization set up by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to operate six bankrupt railroads, have said they would n't comment on any of the testimony. During his testimony, <PERSON> Tepas </PERSON> said workers on erratic schedules do not make up for lost sleep, nor do they adapt to those schedules. The same workers are not usually able to judge how their work has been affected while suffering from chronic sleep deprivation, he added. Though asleep, people can still react automatically in different situations, he said, adding that dozing rail workers could respond to danger signals as part of a natural reflex. `` In all stages of sleep, it is possible for people to perform simple responses to simple stimuli,'' <PERSON> Tepas </PERSON> said. `` People can sleep for a few seconds or minutes and can perform quite well when they wake up,'' he added. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> railroad companies must pay more attention to the consequences of sleep deprivation, <PERSON> Tepas </PERSON> said. Training employees who work unpredictable work schedules how to handle odd sleeping hours would help, as well as adding some kind of change to routine duties, he said. The accident apparently occurred when the westbound trailer train had been shifted to an eastbound track on the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> main line between <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The eastbound coal train apparently ran a stop signal and smashed head-on into the trailer train. The two survivors of the accident both said Wednesday they had had only a few hours of sleep before they reported to duty the day of the wreck. <ORGANIZATION> Inquiry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said the inquiry board would not issue its report for several months. The hearings are scheduled to last through Friday.

<TEXT>
 Two congressmen accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Thursday of ruining children's lives and wasting taxpayer's money by failing to enforce a 1980 law meant to improve the foster care system. `` Children are being abused beyond our wildest expectations. Millions of dollars are being misspent,'' Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., told three federal officials responsible for children's The children `` do n't have permanency. They do n't have services. They ca n't get back to their families. ... What you're really engaged in is state child abuse,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>, Youth and Families, and Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the Ways and Means public assistance subcommittee, led the attack on the trio at the last of three hearings on the foster care system. `` It appears to me that we're doing a reasonably adequate job. It's not an exceptional job,'' said <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, assistant secretary for human development services at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're trying to improve.'' Earlier witnesses had charged that neither the federal government or the states were enforcing the 1980 law, which stresses preserving and reuniting families, and finding permanent homes for children who can not be with their parents. Case plans and case reviews for children in foster care are required at specific intervals. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said `` many positive changes'' had occurred as a result of the law. The Children's Defense Fund said that without the changes, `` the crises facing the child welfare system today would be even more overwhelming. Those and other groups said there remain serious problems ranging from patchwork services and inadequate federal funds to the increasingly disturbed children entering the foster care system as a result of unemployment, poverty, drug abuse, homelessness and family violence. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> aimed their fire at the administration, contending officials are failing to penalize states no matter how bad their records are. `` As one of our witnesses told us, you'd have to work overtime to flunk your audit,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. He said the department is relying on a checklist filled out by states themselves, plus sample cases that do n't reflect the serious problems pinpointed by lawsuits and studies across the country. Those problems have included child abuse by foster parents, slipshod monitoring by authorities responsible for the child's future, and failure to refer children for adoption or return them to their families where that is appropriate <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said a lawsuit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> revealed that child welfare offices were being used as shelters and 1,000 children had been subjected to multiple one-night placements. He said a suicidal 12-year-old was sent to 17 placements in 28 working days. Despite this information, he said, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is one of seven states that has not been audited since the law was enacted. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said she was not aware of the lawsuit, probably because the federal government is not a party to it. `` You are a party to it,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> rejoined. `` You're paying the bill for the care of these children ... When states are out of compliance, they're not supposed to get the money. Somehow, that does n't happen.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> also scored the administrators for failing to help states cope with soaring rates of homelessness, drug abuse and child abuse. They said thousands of children are in foster care because their parents are homeless or the social services their families need are unavailable.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> urged Palestinians in this Arab city Thursday to stop their uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation and said if they did, the bloodshed would cease. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops opened fire on Palestinian protesters, wounding five, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. The army reported three wounded. About 3,000 police were deployed in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as the Moslem fast of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> drew to a close. The Israeli air force made its eighth raid into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year, blasting Palestinian targets south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said six fighter-bombers took part in the attack at <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION>, 16 miles outside <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Police Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON> said `` all necessary measures'' would be taken to prevent disturbances at the close of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, the Moslem holy month due to end Monday or Tuesday with the sighting of the new moon. Thursday marked Laylat Al Kadr, Arabic for `` Night of Fate,'' which falls on the 27th day of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> and marks the giving of the Koran to the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. Police were on patrol to prevent rioting by Moslems gathering at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s sacred <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> for all-night prayers. Officials also are concerned about possible violence on Sunday, when Israelis mark the 40th anniversary of their state as well as the 21st anniversary of the seizure of Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, the second largest <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city, for the first time since unrest broke out in the occupied territories Dec. 8. He toured the narrow stone-paved streets of the Qasbah, or open-air market, passing surprised vendors selling meat, vegetables and donkey saddles. Speaking through a translator, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> residents of the city to stop violence. One <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> told him `` the government should start treating the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> as human beings, especially now, during religious celebrations.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> responded that `` the population should start to behave, and not only during holidays.'' `` If there would be quiet and order, nothing would be done against the population,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. Asked by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> what he was doing to promote peace, one merchant said: `` We are praying and hoping.'' But an Arab youth shouted: `` There wo n't be peace. We want <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>!'' He was quickly pushed away by troops. Arab witnesses said the prime minister's party was preceded by dozens of troops who banged on shop doors and used megaphones to order striking shopkeepers to open. After touring <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was taken by army helicopter to the neighboring <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hagay </LOCATION> Jewish settlement, where about 90 Jewish settlers live in the barren hills south of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the land was `` thirsty for Jewish settlement'' and promised settlers that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would `` march forward'' with the settlement drive. Throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, many shops remained shuttered all day due to conflicting <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and army orders. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders have ordered shops to open in the morning and close in the afternoon, and the army has tried to thwart the organization's control by issuing the opposite orders. The clash in the open-air market of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> started after troops ordered shops in the city closed and youths began throwing stones, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. An official at the city's <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said five youths, including one 13-year-old, were brought in with gunshot wounds. Four were wounded in the legs and one was wounded in the stomach. Since the uprising began, 186 Arabs have died in clashes with Israelis. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and a Jewish teen-ager also have been killed.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is backing <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s request to buy sophisticated F-18 fighter-bombers for defense in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and has begun consulting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to help the plan get off the ground, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Thursday It would be the first sale of two-engine, 500-mile range F-18s to an Arab country, but <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> obviously faces a threat in the gulf.'' `` We've said over and over again that views of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will play a large part in our consideration of this question, but we stress again the threat in the gulf region is clear and we think the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> request is consistent with our policy,'' she said. The administration notified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> several months ago that it expected <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to make a request for advanced aircraft to replace aging, A4 attack planes vulnerable to equipment being used by both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in their seven-year-old war. Of the possible replacements, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> picked the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>'s F-18, the newest of the choices and a plane sold only to treaty allies, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> apparently picked the plane because it was built for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for operations over water and can be converted within minutes from an air-to-air fighter to a well-stocked bomber. Of the other possibilities, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>'s F-15 is considered purely an air-to-air combat plane and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>' F-16 has less versatility than the F-18 in performing bombing and fighter missions with equal effectiveness <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the administration is consulting with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to determine if approval would be granted for the sale of all 40 F-18s <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> wants. In addition, the administration wants to see if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would resist selling F-18s to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, but would accept the transfer of F-16s. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has already permitted F-16 sales to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, another small oil-producing state. Arms sales to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> are closely scrutinized on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where there is concern about giving sophisticated weapons to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations still technically in a state of war with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, raised another concern: the level of weaponry in the war-torn gulf region `` The administration keeps trying to escalate the level of sophistication when there is already an escalation of modern weapons in the region,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. He cited the sale of long-range <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> missiles to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> as an example. `` The F-18, that's our most sophisticated, latest technology,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. `` I'm concerned about it. I just do n't see a need for it at first blush.'' Kuwaiti interest in the F-18s was disclosed during congressional testimony earlier this week by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> affairs. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> have created an increasingly close security relationship since last year, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> committed naval forces to protect U.S.-flagged ships traveling through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Individual F-18s as supplied to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> cost $ 17 million, making the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> sale a potential $ 680 million deal. With a range of 500 nautical miles, Kuwaiti-based F-18 jets could hit targets throughout most of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and deep in Iranian territory.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Jackson Hit Noriega Deal; Reagan `Mortified' by
Endorsement Flap</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Democrats <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> joined the chorus of criticism Thursday against reported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans to drop drug charges against Panamanian dictator <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, while President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was `` mortified'' that his endorsement of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was viewed as less than enthusiastic. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made his first visit to the Capitol as the presumed Democratic nominee and won backing from several congressional leaders before heading to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were campaigning. The White House acknowledged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were trying to coax <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to surrender power, but refused to say whether dropping the drug charges might be part of the deal. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to discuss the matter except to say, `` I favor getting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out. ... When negotiations are going on that are sensitive, you do n't discuss them.'' The Republican vice president called the fuss over the terseness of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement `` much ado about nothing.'' `` I could n't have been more pleased,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> devoted three brief sentences at the end of a speech to a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising dinner Wednesday night to declare his backing for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who clinched the Republican presidential nomination more than two weeks ago. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> still is short of the majority he needs at the Democratic convention, but the string of primary victories put together in recent weeks by the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has ended any doubt that he will be the party's candidate against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the general election. With his new status, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met privately in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with South African Bishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and then with Democratic congressional leaders. He picked up endorsements from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won nearly 80 percent of the vote in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> primary earlier this week and <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, the state's senior senator, said he was endorsing the governor `` without any reservations, because I'm confident, based on our conversation, we're going to have a president who will work with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> also said, `` It's time now that we unite ... We need now to begin to close ranks, and that's what we're doing today.'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` the candidate best able to lead our nation.'' After meeting with <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he `` very strongly'' supported tougher sanctions against the white supremacist regime in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` It's time to change our policy and I assure you if all goes well ... there will be a fundamental change in policy,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` This country has got to lead in human rights.'' In recent days, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has hammered away at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the question of what the vice president knew about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s involvement in drug trafficking. At the Capitol, he focused on the reports the administration might drop the drug charges. `` I think before we start talking about dropping indictments and making deals, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people deserve a full explanation of what kind of relationship this administration has had with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ... Just exactly what has been going on for the past 7 -LCB- years,'' he said. `` I do n't believe you drop indictments against suspected drug runners and murderers.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sounded a similar theme during a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, news conference. `` They want to exonerate him altogether,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` It's not just <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> Others are dealing in drugs. We ca n't indict them one day and exonerate them the next day. That is no policy at all.'' <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press secretary, told reporters the president was `` mortified'' about the endorsement flap. `` He thought the speech was terrific. He wrote it himself,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> issued a statement later that said, `` I was surprised by the news reports that have said my endorsement last evening of the vice president was ` lukewarm.' I am enthusiastic, fully committed and, as I have said, will go all out to make Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> talked about the endorsement in advance. `` He showed me those remarks he had handwritten,'' said the vice president. `` I still have them.'' In other political developments: _ The three major television reaffirmed their support of legislation to set a uniform poll closing time during presidential election years. The legislation, which has passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would order a 9 p.m. EST poll simultaneous poll closing time. _ Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> embarked on a political trip to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and said he planned to `` have some fun'' attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who resisted entreaties he get into the Democratic race, said he thought the contest for his party's nomination had strengthened <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is already a favorite in the polls and I'm not surprised,'' said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Congress Considers How To Get Nuclear Wastes To Nevada Dump Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly six months after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tabbed <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, as the permanent burial site for high-level nuclear wastes, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel began deliberations Thursday on how to get the stuff there without risking a catastrophe. House Interior Chairman <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, D-Ariz., noted that the years-long struggle to pick a repository site for spent reactor fuel and other highly radioative junk may have been only half the battle `` No one wants a repository in his backyard, but no one wants nuclear waste trucks driving down his street either,'' he said. Major shipments of nuclear wastes, principally from storage pools near the 110 nuclear power plants around the nation, will not begin until the repository is completed early next century. But nearly every state is on proposed transit routes. Industry officials told <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>'s energy subcommittee that past, albiet limited, experience in shipping high-level wastes demonstrates no cause for alarm. `` There has never been an accident in over 20 years of spent fuel shipment that has resulted in a release of radiation,'' said D.A. <PERSON> Brodnick </PERSON>, a nuclear specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Melinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said that `` although the people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been spared the consequences of an accident involving a release of radioactivity, it is not because the government runs a technically unimpeachable program, but rather because, so far, we have been lucky.'' She pointed to a <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> study which said an `` extreme'' accident involving a truck carrying one type of container used in the past, called an LLD-1, could result in the release of a kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of plutonium. If that happened in a major urban area, she said, it could result in thousands of latent cancer deaths and billions of dollars in contamination damage. <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>'s panel is considering a variety of bills designed to upgrade shipping standards, including new requirements for the crash-worthiness of shipping casks, selection of routes and pre-notification to communities along the way. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON>, the nuclear waste project manager for <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, complained that his city was `` at the end of the transportation funnel'' to <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, and that `` without a beltway bypass and alternative railroad spurs, we will become exposed to the hazards and risks of thousands of road and rail shipments.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, an industry consultant, said a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> indicated that, using trucks, there was a probability of one accident involving a measurable release of radiation for every 15 billion miles traveled. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> said that assuming all shipments of spent fuel were made by truck, `` there might be an accident which results in a minor release about every 1,300 years, with minimal public health consequences.'' But Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilbray </PERSON>, D-Nev., said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had told him its own calculations indicated an accident would be likely every 40 million truck miles And that, he noted, would be the mileage required to transport the waste already stored at reactor sites _ to say nothing of the amount that will be generated in the years ahead.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he `` could n't be more pleased'' with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement of his Republican presidential bid, brushing aside as `` absolutely absurd'' suggestions that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s support was unenthusiastic The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be refused to answer questions about a reported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deal with Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> that would involve dropping drug trafficking charges in exchange for his stepping down from power. `` I favor getting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avionics </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. `` I've learned something from some experience in this _ when negotiations are going on that are sensitive you do n't discuss them.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kicked off a seven-day western campaign swing with a slap at <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We can not afford a radical swing. We can not afford a president who opposes every step we are taking to keep our defense at the technological edge,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Albuquerque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> after the defense plant tour. He portrayed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as someone `` who opposes the MX, who opposes the Midgetman, who opposes testing of nuclear weapons ... who flirts with the withdrawal of our troops from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> holds a primary on June 7 along with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. After the <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> stop, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. He also planned to visit <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> before that state's primary next Tuesday. The Republican heir-apparent to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was quick to reject suggestions that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement Wednesday night was less than he wanted. `` I thought it was just great,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. `` I could n't have been more pleased.'' He said he could n't understand the commentary that the president's endorsement was flat and uninspiring from the man he has loyally served for the past seven years. `` Where all this flak is coming from I heard about on the news _ it's totally absurd,'' he told reporters. `` It's much ado about nothing.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement was just three sentences in a speech that he delivered to a party dinner in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On Thursday, the president issued a statement about the flap. `` I was surprised by the news reports that have said my endorsement of last evening of the vice president was ` lukewarm.' I am enthusiastic, fully committed and, as I have said, will go all out to make Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> has been a partner in all we have accomplished and he should be elected. He has my full confidence and my total support. I will campaign actively on his behalf.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had talked about the endorsement in advance. `` He showed me those remarks he had handwritten. ... I still have them,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement at the Rotary Club speech. `` You may have seen that the president endorsed me last night. That was a relief,'' he said as the audience laughed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides were hesitant to comment on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> endorsement. All <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> would say was, `` That's behind us now. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was mystified that his endorsement was viewed as anything less than whole-hearted. `` He is mortified,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` He thought the speech was terrific.

<TEXT>
 The Near East and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> are the Third World's largest arms importers, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is their biggest single supplier, according to a report released Thursday. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> found that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ranks second among the world's 11 major arms suppliers to the Third World. The 70-page study by defense analyst <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimmett </PERSON> ranked <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> fifth after <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, saying the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government committed 79 percent of its arms exports to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> from 1984 to 1987. Rounding out the list of the top 11 are <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The report, which charts arms agreements with the Third World from 1980 to 1987, found that the Soviets had increased their share of the Latin American arms agreements by 10 percent over the past three years. In 1987, arms agreements with the Third World amounted to $ 30 billion _ the lowest since the peak 1980 total of $ 60.5 billion, according to the report. From 1980 to 1987, the value of all Third World arms contracts was $ 306.8 billion, with the <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> accounting for more than 67 percent. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales agreement with the Third World rose to $ 5.6 billion in 1987, from $ 4.1 billion in 1986, constituting 18.5 percent of the total. Soviet agreements, which constituted 48.5 percent of the total for the period, fell slightly in 1987 to $ 14.6 billion, the report said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, who have been at war with each other for 7 -LCB- years, accounted for 20.9 percent _ or $ 64.1 billion _ of all Third World arms agreements from 1980 to 1987, according to the study. The Soviets supplied 29 percent of the combatants' arms, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> accounted for 13 percent. The share of all European non-communist countries in agreements with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was 31 percent, the study said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s largest supply source was all communists states excluding the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. They accounted for 31 percent of the total. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s second-largest supply source with 21 percent. The Soviets were <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s single biggest supply source with 37 percent of the total, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s share was 10 percent, according to the study. The trend of arms contracts to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> underwent a major shift, the report found. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s share rose from 48.2 percent in 1980-1983, to 59.8 percent in 1984-1987, the study said. Of the Soviets' nearly $ 8.2 billion in 1984-1987 arms agreements with <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, 70 percent were with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the share of Latin American arms contracts with the major Western European countries as a bloc _ <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ dropped from 21.2 percent in 1980-1983 to 10.6 percent in 1984-1987. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> decreased slightly to 9.6 percent in 1984-1987, from 9.9 percent in the previous period.

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Urges House To Pass Securities Underwriting Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> on Thursday urged the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to follow the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s lead and pass major legislation to give banks new securities underwriting powers. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> favored the approach taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which in late March approved legislation that would repeal most restrictions of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act. That statute barred a mingling of the banking and securities industries. The 1933 law was one of the reforms passed following the 1929 stock market crash. It was aimed at curbing the types of speculation which were blamed for the crash. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that one of the attractive features of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation is `` that its near-complete repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act allows for a market driven evolution of financial services and products.'' `` I would urge the House in its deliberations in the months ahead to adopt an approach similar to that of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., faces an uncertain future Opponents of the measure in the securities industry have an ally in Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Once before, in 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill to give banks broader powers but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has never done so. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> made his comments in a speech to banking officials in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. His remarks were also released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the legislation did not represent a bailout for banks but was instead a reorganization of the financial services industry which would better serve the public. `` The public benefits of expanded powers include not only a stronger and safer banking system, but also the more efficient and convenient delivery of a wider array of lower-cost financial services,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill would permit a company that owns a bank to also own a securities company as long as the two subsidiaries were operated separately. The securities affiliate would be allowed to underwrite municipal-revenue bonds, mortgage-backed securities and commercial paper. Within six months of the bill becoming law, the legislation would allow the securities affiliates to begin underwriting mutual funds and corporate bonds. In 1991, the legislation requires that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> vote on whether to allow the securities affiliates to take the next step of being able to underwrite corporate stock.

<HEAD>Networks Ask Passage of Uniform-Poll-Closing Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The three major television networks renewed their support for a national uniform-poll-closing time on Thursday and promised in the meantime not to project a winner in any state in November's presidential election before polls are closed in that state. Representatives of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> they will make permanent their commitment to avoid early calling of state races if legislation is approved to have all polls in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> close at 9 p.m. EST. Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., who conducted the hearing and is a strong supporter of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation, drew the commitment from <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, senior vice president for news at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, vice president and <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> chief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitofsky </PERSON>, vice president, election and survey unit, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, D-Wash., said, however, that the networks had made the commitment previously but that <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had violated it during the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democratic presidential primary <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, who helped push a uniform-closing-time bill through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in November, showed the committee a videotape of the three networks during the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. In it, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said exit polls indicated <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could be a big winner over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, even though many of the state's polling places were still open. `` I can assure you that it was an inadvertent aberration and it will not occur again,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. In 1984, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said, all three networks had declared President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s re-election by 5:30 p.m. PST. `` At that point, only 3 percent of the vote had been tallied and polls in 26 states were still open,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` There is something wrong when voters in <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> do not feel their votes have the same impact as that of voters in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>.'' Under the legislation, polls would close at 9 p.m. in the Eastern time zone, 8 p.m. in the Central time zone and 7 p.m. in the Mountain time zone. In the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> time zone, daylight saving time would be extended until the Sunday after Election Day. This provision, affecting <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> panhandle, would permit a 7 p.m. local-time poll closing simultaneous with 9 p.m. EST. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> would not be affected by the measure, which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved 208-109 on Nov. 10. Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, ranking committee Republican, expressed concern that the two states not in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be exempt. `` I'm not going to upset the agreement,'' said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who has sought uniform-poll-closing legislation since 1971, `` but I will look into this to see if we can get the off-shore states involved.'' When <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> asked if the networks would withhold declaring a presidential winner until the polls close in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, each of the representatives shook his head in the negative. `` We have believed for a long time that when the polls close in a given state, we should report what we know about what happened in that state,'' said <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>. `` I do n't think we're prepared to withhold any information after the polls close -LRB- in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>, senior vice president and general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which represents most of the scheduled airlines, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benfield </PERSON>, executive director of the Daylight Saving <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, testified that they oppose passage of the legislation. <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> said the changing of daylight saving time on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> for two weeks every four years would disrupt airline schedules, affect overnight service standards and result in the deterioration of quick deliveries.

 The deal the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is trying to make to remove <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power is prompting renewed concern over using plea bargains in criminal cases. But even critics acknowledge that such negotiations, while stirring public outrage at times, are essential to prosecutors and the courts. `` This takes the air out of the guts of agents who are busting their chops fighting drug smuggling,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> diGenova </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> negotiations. `` They're going to ask, ` Why the hell was he indicted in the first place?''' But <PERSON> diGenova </PERSON> quickly added, `` Plea bargaining is perfectly proper. It depends on the what the bargain is. What does the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government get out of it?'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said Thursday it was discussing a deal that could result in the dropping of drug-trafficking charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in exchange for his agreement to relinquish power. But White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> refused to say if the drug charges were involved in the plea bargain. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said if the arrangement works it `` would be the most fruitful and productive plea bargain that we have seen in a long time.'' Plea bargains _ resulting in reduced prison terms, probation or dropped indictments _ sometimes may resemble distasteful deals with the devil. But they are an entrenched part of the criminal justice system, a vital tool for easing crowded court dockets or persuading a defendant to testify against a higher-up in a criminal conspiracy. Prosecutors also bargain with defendants because they fear weaknesses in their cases, settling for a reduced sentence rather than risking acquittal. `` There are always plea bargains you would rather not make,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. `` Do I regret them? Yeah, I regret a lot from the emotional standpoint. From the intellectual standpoint, I agree with all of them.'' <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said it may well be that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` views the presence of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as such a cancer on the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'' that it is willing to let him off the hook to get him out of power. But <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> also noted that there was a slim chance <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ever would be brought to trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> even if the charges against him were not dropped. The difficulties in extraditing a foreign leader or forcing his expulsion from his homeland could be insurmountable, he said. One of the most publicized plea bargains in the nation's history led to the resignation of then-Vice President <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> on Oct. 10, 1973. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> pleaded no contest to federal income tax evasion and was fined $ 10,000 and sentenced to probation for three years. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> had been under investigation in a probe of alleged political graft and bribe-taking dating back to his days as a county executive and then governor of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> before <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> picked him as his running mate. The plea agreement prompted outrage in some quarters. But then-Attorney General <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said it was an honorable end to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said the evidence `` establishes a pattern of substantial cash payments'' to <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> while he was governor of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> in return for state engineering contracts. But the former attorney general said <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>'s resignation and the stain on his reputation were punishment enough. In 1985, <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading Wall Street brokerage firm, pleaded guilty to 2,000 felony counts of mail and wire fraud in a $ 4.35 billion scheme to write checks exceeding funds on deposits at more than 400 banks. No individuals were named in the charges, and no one went to jail. But <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> paid a $ 2 million fine, plus $ 750,000 to help pay for the government's investigation. The company also agreed to set up an $ 8 million fund to make restitution to the banks. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the agreement sent `` a message to the business world that so-called white-collar crime ... will not be tolerated.'' But critics said the company and its officials escaped with barely a slap on the wrist. The Carter administration was criticized by some when in 1977 former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor charges of failing to testify fully about the agency's attempts to prevent the election of <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allende </ORGANIZATION> as president of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in 1970 The government said it accepted the plea to avoid accidental disclosure of government secrets if <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> went to trial. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> was fined $ 2,000, placed on probation for a year and declared `` in disgrace and shame'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. In contrast, a plea agreement in March this year involving former presidential aide <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> caused hardly a ripple. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> pleaded guilty to misleading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by assuring lawyers the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was not helping arm Nicaraguan rebels during a ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> has not yet been sentenced.

 Jewish leaders said Thursday that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had assured them he will press Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit to make good on promised human rights gains. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry, quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying, `` In no way are the Soviets going to get us to retreat from these principals and from the insistence to their obedience to their obligations.'' <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, accompanied by <PERSON> Simcha </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinitz </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, told reporters outside the White House that the meeting `` went extremely well.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, on May 25 and make a presummit speech en route to his May 29-June 2 summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> credited the president with having `` absolutely institutionalized the use of summitry to advance the cause of human rights and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jewry </LOCATION> in a way that it can never be ignored by any subsequent administration.'' `` And the proof of that is that on Oct. 10, 1987, prior to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last year, Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the first time joined the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a statement that human rights and humanitarian affairs would be on the agenda _ something they had never admitted before as a matter that was rightfully on the agenda.'' <PERSON> Dinitz </PERSON> was asked whether he thought <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would be willing to make major headway in improving Jewish emigration rights, given the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader's boast during the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit that `` I'm not on trial here. `` I might say he might not be on trial,'' said <PERSON> Dinitz </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, `` but the action and behavior with regard to human rights are on trial. And the prosecutor, so to speak, is not the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but the conscience of mankind.'' `` We are all aware of the fact that at the last summit meeting, Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said to the president, ` By what right do you have to challenge us on those questions''' <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> said. `` The right is derived from documents they themselves signed.'' `` And to be fair about it, there has been an improvement of the emigration figures in the last few months under Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> said. He said there had been about 1,100 emigrations in the first four months of 1988, compared with about 1,000 in an entire year before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ascension to power. But <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> said the figures were even higher under <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, before the advent of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his `` glasnost'' society. `` We welcome improvement, and with every improvement, we will say, on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry, ` Things are improving,' but they are a long way from fulfilling their obligations under international undertakings,'' he said.

The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> trip, planned months ago, was once viewed as possible evidence that <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> had hopes of a deadlocked national convention turning to him with its presidential nomination. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> speech on Saturday comes just three days before the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> presidential primary.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is turning increasingly to barter arrangements with other countries in an effort to stretch its declining reserves of foreign currency, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst said Thursday. `` Foreign currency is tight for the Soviet government, which in turn has decreased the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s buying power significantly,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON>, now the agency's deputy director of marketing for dairy, livestock and poultry, recently returned from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after 2 -LCB- years as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural attache. His remarks were in a new issue of the agency's Foreign Agriculture magazine. The Soviets make it plain they are in a better position to exchange products for foreign goods than to pay in foreign currency. `` This is a difficult constraint on trade from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standpoint,'' <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> simply does not have the ability to supply the quantity or quality of either agricultural or non-agricultural products which would make a barter arrangement feasible.'' <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imports only about $ 25 million worth of Soviet agricultural products each year, while the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products averages around $ 2 billion annually. `` This situation has led to continuing Soviet pressure to lift <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> import restrictions on Soviet furskins and other commodities, and pressure for most-favored-nation -LRB- MFN -RRB- trade status, which would give the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> preferential access to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market,'' he said. Under <ORGANIZATION> MFN </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would grant the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> the same trading privileges that it offers most other foreign trading partners. The <ORGANIZATION> MFN </ORGANIZATION> designation for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been held up for years because of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s restrictive emigration policies. These issues are likely to persist in any trade negotiation between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON> said. Currently, negotiators are working on a successor to the five-year grain agreement between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Girl Scout Cookies Leave For Japan For Second Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A shipment of Girl Scout cookies winged out of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Thursday on its second trip to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after a Brownie troop got a taste of the power of politics. Sailors aboard the USS Midway, stationed in <LOCATION> Atsugi </LOCATION>, bought the 402 boxes from Brownie Troop 807 in <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION>. But the plan crumbled when the the girls were told that the cookies faced a stiff customs tariff in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The cookies were sent back and sat in an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> office at the Corpus Christi International Airport for more than a week. The sweets finally left Thursday morning on a flight to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, where the Thin Mints, <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> <PERSON> Yangles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scot </PERSON> <PERSON> Ts </PERSON>, Savannahs, Jubilees, Classic Cremes and Hoedowns caught a connecting non-stop flight to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said officials for the airline, which provided free transportation. `` They're on the way, and the red tape should be turning to green by now,'' <PERSON> Marchetta </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, the troop's leader, said Thursday. The shipment was to arrive Friday afternoon in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel originally told her the Japanese demanded a tariff of more than $ 2,000 before releasing the cookies from customs. But the consulate-general of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> last week attributed the cookie misfortune to `` insufficient communications among those who are involved with customs clearance.'' A spokesman for the consulate said the import fees amounted to about 20,000 yen, or about $ 150. According to a statement issued by the consulate, there would have been no customs fee `` if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces had taken necessary procedures.'' Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, worked through diplomatic channels to get the cookies to the sailors without a customs fee, and sent a telegram to the Brownies on Wednesday. `` This all happened because you wanted to do something nice for some sailors serving our country on the other side of the the world ...,'' the telegram said. `` Now everyone has seen how helpful Brownies in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are.'' He added that he was `` sure the ` Cookie Monster' is pleased, too.'' The 18-member <PERSON> Brownie </PERSON> troop first started corresponding with the sailors at Christmas, then sent a Valentine's Day package and finally the April 26 shipment of cookies, Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. They could not send the cookies by mail because it would have been too expensive, Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, and the airline offered free shipment. `` Everybody who was supposed to be getting the cookies was really upset when they did n't get them,'' said Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolford </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s son-in-law, who is stationed on the Midway and on leave in <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION>. The girls prepared another gift for the sailors Wednesday by posing on the steps of the <LOCATION> Bee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> for a color photo they will send the sailors, said Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON>. Meanwhile, she added, the troop will wait to hear how the sailors liked the cookies: `` They're waiting for the letters that will be coming to them again.''

<HEAD>Army Says Germ Warfare Research Is Safe, Essential and Benefits

<TEXT>
 The Army unveiled a massive study Thursday designed to support its biological warfare research program, portraying the work as safe to the environment, essential to national security and a boon to science. `` In recognition of the potentially hazardous nature of -LRB- this -RRB- type of research ... the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as well as the scientific community has developed and implemented elaborate controls to assure adequate protection for the work force and virtually total protection for the external environment,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> concluded in a draft environmental impact statement. `` The history of the <ORGANIZATION> Biological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> illustrates the effectiveness of these controls. ... Additional mitigation was not found to be justified.'' The report, which runs several hundred pages, was condemned quickly by the environmental group that forced its preparation as `` shoddy and incomplete.'' `` They have not complied with the spirit or the letter of the court order against them,'' said <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, the president of the Foundation on Economic Trends. `` We are putting the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on notice that unless they completely revise the method and content of the environmental impact study, we will file suit again,'' <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said. The environmental study was prompted by a lawsuit <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>'s group filed in September 1986. The foundation is a Washington-based environmental activist group that has long focused its attention on the dangers of biological research and genetic engineering. Within the biological field, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has committed itself by international treaty not to develop offensive biological weapons. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> maintains a large defensive program aimed at developing vaccines and antidotes, detection systems and battlefield gear that could be used to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers if attacked with natural or man-made poisons. In order to develop such defenses, laboratories must work with a variety of deadly toxins. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, roughly $ 60 million is now being spent yearly on such research at more than 100 military, university and private laboratories in 27 states and eight foreign countries. The foundation's suit sought to stop the research on grounds the program had grown so large that an impact study had become a legal necessity. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> agreed to submit the environmental study as long as it could continue the work in the interim. In essence, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> concluded Thursday its operating procedures and lab safety features had evolved to the point `` that even severe accidents would not create significant risk or impact upon the quality of the human environment.'' `` It is recognized that controversy exists concerning the need and appropriateness of the <ORGANIZATION> Biological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>,'' the study continued. `` But defense against biological weapons is considered a vital component of the overall defense posture of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies. `` And ... certain aspects of the program should be recognized as beneficial. A large portion of the <ORGANIZATION> BDRP </ORGANIZATION> effort ... is for basic research and development.'' `` Offering us conclusory statements that everything is OK is simply immaterial,'' <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON>, a foundation attorney, said. `` The legal standard here is a ` hard look' analysis of possible hazards, and this is n't a ` hard look.' For example, they list 129 laboratories across the country and do n't tell us exactly what's going on at those labs, what organisms are being researched and what security and precautions have been taken That's unacceptable. Ironically, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> released its impact study just one day after a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee blasted the Pentagon for `` serious deficiencies'' in the safety management of both the biological and chemical warfare research programs. The majority staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Governmental Affairs oversight subcommittee reported it had found `` inadequate regulations, lax safety enforcement and documented safety lapses.'' In the biological weapons area, the review found that `` there is no comprehensive set of safety regulations for research'' with biological warfare agents and toxins, `` no emphasis on safety in the contractor program and no office that monitors contractor safety.''

Officer <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Camden </PERSON> said police removed the painting `` for safekeeping because of the possibility of inciting civil unrest.'' He said it would be returned Thursday. The painting by student <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> depicts <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wearing a frilly white bra, panties and stockings, holding a pencil and frowning out at viewers. It had been displayed in a school hall with dozens of others in a student competition. The school offers a four-year bachelor of arts program and a two-year master's degree, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frech </PERSON>, a spokesman for the private school whose sister institution is the adjacent art musuem. The exhibit is closed to the public, but the aldermen say they got involved after receiving numerous complaints from angry constituents who had seen the painting. They contend the work titled `` Mirth and Girth'' is an insult to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But a group of students argue the painting is artistic self-expression and protected by the First Amendment. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would have agreed with both assessments, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` He would not have been amused,'' and would have seen the painting as `` aiding and abetting'' a campaign waged by his detractors to raise questions about his character, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. But <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> added, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would have strongly felt that `` in terms of either ordinance statute or constitutional law ... there's absolutely no way that it can be suppressed. `` I do n't think it's the most tasteful portrait, but I do n't think that matters,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> told radio station WLUP `` Nobody said when I went to the Art Institute that I had to produce tasteful artwork. In fact ... that goes against everything the institution is about,'' he said. `` It's like saying you have to produce artwork in a certain way.'' At the school, a group of about 15 people marched peacefully outside Thursday to protest the painting as the board of directors met inside to discuss the matter. <PERSON> Frech </PERSON> said he did not know what options the board was considering. Civil liberties experts and legal scholars took the students' side `` We're against censorship and this seems to be a form of censorship,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Polsby </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor, called the aldermen's behavior `` constitutionally indefensible. `` They behaved like a lynch mob and very seriously violated the civil rights of -LRB- the artist -RRB- as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Streeter </PERSON>, who was among those who stormed the school and helped draft a resolution demanding that the painting be removed, said he's aware of the constitutional issues involved. `` There's a moral question that outweighs the constitutional question,'' he said Thursday. The city of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> gives the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the school, subsidies of $ 5 million a year `` as well as other public and private funds, and we do n't feel that any institution, private or public, has a right to portray a leader of any community ... in such a derogatory fashion,'' he said. <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, who sponsored the resolution, said police removed the painting because `` it posed a threat to the safety to the school and the general community.'' `` People, particularly from the black community, are highly perturbed _ using it mildly _ about this particular portrait,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who died in November, was the city's first black mayor. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> was looking for the student and would represent him if he chose to protest the case in court.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is keeping on indefinitely a press aide who was the focus of controversy due to angry letters he wrote to newspapers and revelations he was the author of a sex book. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mair </PERSON>, 59, originally had agreed to a six-month contract that was due to expire at the end of May. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> decided Tuesday after talking to <PERSON> Mair </PERSON> that he would keep the press aide on his staff `` as another hand at the oar,'' <PERSON> Mair </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Mair </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> are working together on a book on the 200-year history of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which celebrates its bicentennial in April 1989. <PERSON> Mair </PERSON> said he will concentrate on media liaison work, helping the speaker research material for newspaper opinion columns and revive the Democratic congressman's newsletter to the constituents in his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> district. Rumors circulated in January, a month after <PERSON> Mair </PERSON> was hired, that he would be resigning following revelations he was the author of a book of reviews of 113 books on sex, love and romance. `` We're two honorable men who stick by our word,'' <PERSON> Mair </PERSON> said. `` We both told everyone I would have a six-month trial period and everyone became astonished when we kept our word and I was astonished that everyone was astonished.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in January had distanced himself from a series of intemperate letters written by <PERSON> Mair </PERSON> to 19 newspapers, including one to the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> suggesting two reporters had engaged in plagiarism in their profile of the speaker. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> angrily protested <PERSON> Mair </PERSON>'s letter. Other recipients of angry letters included the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> apologized for the letters, saying at the time: `` While I am as concerned as <PERSON> George </PERSON> over lack of balance in some of this coverage, angry letters obviously do little to correct it.'' `` I wrote 19 letters, but only five were reported on,'' <PERSON> Mair </PERSON> said of criticism of him. `` Then I wrote a book on love and intimacy and relations between men and women. I just wrote 113 book reviews. It was originally titled ` A Guide to Books on Love and Intimacy.' But it was changed to ` The Sex Book Digest.''' <PERSON> Mair </PERSON>, an author of numerous books, a former columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION> and a former editor and publisher of the <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Gazette </PERSON>, said his letters did not reflect that he is `` against my fellow journalists.'' He said his letter outlined `` patent, outright lies.'' `` I talked to almost all of those people I wrote letters to and several said they checked back the story and found the reporter did not have the facts straight, and that's all I asked,'' he said.

<HEAD>FAA Proposal Would Require Safer Airline Seats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday proposed that existing airline seats be modified to better protect passengers during hard or crash landings and that seats on new aircraft offer similar protection. The upgraded seats would increase passengers' chances of escaping survivable accidents without serious injury and would be less likely to reak loose and block aisles, allowing easier emergency evacuation, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said the seats would `` meet new dynamic test standards that simulate actual crash loads and are consistent with current floor strength levels. The new seats would also be required to absorb some of the impact of a crash landing without passing it on to the passengers.'' Under the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed rules, airlines would have seven years to retrofit their fleets with better seats, starting from the time that new aircraft were required to carry upgraded seats. The proposal is based on a five-year research and development program by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The program used dummies to monitor human tolerance for crash impact forces.

<TEXT>
 A man charged with drunken driving was allowed to plead guilty to speeding in exchange for a $ 20,000 donation to a drug task force, a plea bargain that has angered some residents. District Attorney General <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> said the benefit to the public outweighed the mandatory 48-hour jail term, $ 250 fine and yearlong driver's license suspension for first-time drunken driving convictions. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Donihe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kingsport </LOCATION> pleaded guilty Friday to the reduced charge. <PERSON> Donihe </PERSON> was arrested in April 1986 after he was clocked driving at 78 mph and had a blood alcohol level of 0.15 percent, police said. Legal intoxication in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is 0.10 percent. The leaders of two area chapters of Mothers Against Drunk Driving criticized <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> for accepting the offer by <PERSON> Donihe </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION> chapter, is calling for <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>'s resignation. `` If I was n't a Christian, I could tell you what I really think,'' she said. `` I feel that the people who let him off are the real criminals.'' <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortner </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION> chapter in <LOCATION> Kingsport </LOCATION>, said the decision to accept a plea bargain in the case `` almost sounds like a bribe.'' `` I've weighed the criticism and I'm willing to take it,'' <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> said. `` We have successfully prosecuted several thousand drunk drivers. ... If we made a mistake in the case then my batting average is still 999.99 of doing the right thing.'' Criminal Court Judge <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who approved the plea bargain expressed some reservation before accepting the plea, saying, `` It bothers my conscience.'' <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, whose teen-age son was killed in a 1986 traffic accident, has been a vocal opponent of drunken driving. He said the contribution to the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, which he helped found, was `` a proper disposition of the case.'' The unit, made up of officers from various agencies, investigates drug cases in four counties. It is funded with court fines, private donations and tax dollars from local governments.

<HEAD>Authorities Say Actor Rose Was Murdered; Cocaine Found</HEAD>

 Four men have been charged with murdering actor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> by clubbing him to death, police said Thursday. The four include <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s 18-year-old adopted son and the youth's father. A sworn statement said the Broadway performer was held for eight hours before he was killed May 4 and attempts were made to make the death look like an accident. The death of the British-born <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, 68, winner of <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> awards for `` The Mystery of <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Drood </PERSON>'' and a revival of `` My Fair Lady,'' had originally been blamed on a single-car accident. Police and doctors said Thursday that cocaine was found on <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and that laboratory tests performed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> showed traces of a cocaine derivative in his body at the time of his death. A statement read by police spokesman Col. <PERSON> Aquiles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> at a news conference said three men were arrested and a fourth suspect was at large. The statement said the three `` confessed to police that they planned the crime when they noticed Mr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> felt certain amorous weaknesses for another 14-year old minor.'' The three _ <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s adopted son, <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralfe </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON>, nicknamed <PERSON> Juan </PERSON>; the young man's natural father, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, and the youth's uncle, <PERSON> Maximo </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> _ appeared at the news conference and told reporters they took part in the actor's death. `` What I really wanted was to take revenge on the American <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> because of his homosexual activities, since he was hurting a lot of boys in this sector, in addition to mine, whom he had already prostituted since the age of 13,'' said a sworn statement from <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> distributed to reporters by police. The statement said the youth, the youth's uncle and another man he paid $ 200 agreed to take <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> to an isolated location and kill him. On May 4, when <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> was driving his car to the city of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> with his adopted son, the three other men waited by the side of the road near the north coast town of <LOCATION> Sosua </LOCATION> and forced the car to stop. They got in, leaving the adopted son behind, and drove to a nearby farm, where they held Rose for eight hours before killing him, it said. `` Around 8 p.m. we clubbed him to death beating him on the head,'' the statement said. The father's statement said the men took the money from <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s pockets and divided it, but left his documents intact They then put <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s body in the car and drove to a small ditch, where `` we flipped the car over to make it look like a traffic accident.'' Results of an autopsy released Monday described the death as accidental, but pathologist <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarita </PERSON> told reporters Thursday the final report indicated `` the death was not an accident but a homicide.'' He said `` investigations ... indicated the car was impacted at a very slow speed that would not have exceeded 15 kilometers per hour -LRB- just over 9 mph -RRB- so -LRB- Rose's -RRB- injuries could not have been from that impact.'' <PERSON> Sarita </PERSON> said tests in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> showed traces of a cocaine derivative in <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s urine but none in his brain. `` While examining <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s documents at the site where the body was found police ... found he was carrying an amount of cocaine in his purse,'' said the police statement. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> had owned a beach home outside <LOCATION> Sosua </LOCATION>, about 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION>, for the past nine years. His adopted son, who lived in the house, said in a sworn statement released by police that he met <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> six years ago when he was a student and that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> suggested adopting him in 1985. He said his real father agreed and the adoption was legal. The youth said in the statement that on April 30, he told his father <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> was returning to the island in a few days and that `` I felt bad because he had shown he felt a certain weakness for a minor ... who lived in our house.'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who had lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> since 1961, was a versatile actor who was as much at home playing <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> as he was in a comedy or a musical. He preferred the stage, but also appeared in scores of motion pictures and television productions. A memorial service is planned for May 25 at the Shubert Theater.

 State prison inmates with AIDS sometimes get improper medical care and are being unnecessarily denied freedom for the final days of their lives, a prison watchdog group charged Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said an 18-month investigation demonstrated that the prison system and state government have not responded adequately'' to AIDS in the prisons. `` AIDS and prison is proving to be a devastating combination,'' said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Potler </PERSON>, author of the report. Among other things, the association urged mandatory education about AIDS for prisoners and staff, expanded and better-supervised medical care, and new provisions to allow the release of terminally ill prisoners. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which has more AIDS cases than any other state, also has more prisoners with AIDS. As of the end of last year 597 AIDS cases had been confirmed among <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s prison inmates, said state prison system spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Flateau </PERSON>. Of those, 346 inmates died while in prison, 152 had been released and 99 remained in custody. He said about 100 AIDS cases and 120 cases of AIDS-Related Complex, are in the 42,000-inmate system. There is no known cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which is fatal. The association had medical consultants and non-medical investigators visit several prisons to prepare its report. The group said it also found that inmates suffering from AIDS are often shunned by other inmates who are afraid of even casual contact. Inmate barbers at one prison refused to give haircuts to men with AIDS, said the report. And while prison officials told the association that `` the hysteria initially expressed by the security staff has subsided considerably'' over the last three years, the watchdog group still found evidence of fear. State Corrections Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> said the association's medical team should have spent more time in the prisons. `` Much of the report consists of the opinions of non-medical researchers, supported by unattributed comments by staff and inmates, the content of which may or may not be accurate,'' <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> said.

 A federal judge questioned Thursday whether the government alone can drop the drug indictment against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and local prosecutors inisted they want to try the case. `` My understanding and knowledge of the law is that the presiding judge is not required to dismiss an indictment on the motion of the government,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON>, who is handling the case. `` However, I am having the law researched further.'' Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Thursday that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is discussing a deal that could result in the dropping of drug trafficking charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in exchange for his agreement to relinquish power. The lead prosecutor in the case, Chief Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>, said Thursday he strongly opposes any deal. `` I am against the dismissal, and right now I am ready to try this case,'' said <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>'s boss, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, released a statement through his executive assistant <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> following his meeting with Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` He would not discuss the details of his talk with Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, but he said, ` I presented my views,''' Ms. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said. `` I am authorized to say his views have n't changed, and he wants to proceed with the case and he's ready to proceed with the trial.''' <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> has previously vowed not to dismiss the indictment, but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s attorneys said the government has little choice. `` General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> believes, and always has believed, that the indictment against him was a political indictment,'' his attorney, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, said Thursday. `` So a dismissal of the indictment would have to be a pre-condition to any discussions.'' <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>'s associate, attorney <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON>, was called back to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Thursday following the revelations about a possible deal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, who brought a separate indictment in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, refused comment Thursday on reports he has threatened to quit if the charges are dropped. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> prosecuting <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, alleged to be a member of the same <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> that prosecutors say paid <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to protect its interest. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is charged in a 12-count <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment with accepting $ 4.6 million in bribes from the cartel; in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, he faces three marijuana importation counts. The possibility of a deal was good news for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s co-defendants <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidow </PERSON>, the only defendant arrested in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> case, also should have his case dismissed, said his attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpstein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON> agreed. `` If they made me dismiss this case, I would dismiss against Mr. <PERSON> Davidow </PERSON> and all the other defendants,'' the prosecutor said. `` It would be a travesty of justice to proceed against any of the defendants if the case against the chief defendant was dismissed.''

<HEAD>Presidential Panel Says Adoption Overlooked as Alternative to
Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A panel of federal officials Thursday recommended legislative and other changes to encourage adoption, which it said was `` too often forgotten, ignored or misunderstood'' as an alternative to abortion. The <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Adoption also said `` the pool of adoptive parents should expand, and martial status, age or physical disabilities should not preclude individuals from consideration as prospective parents.'' However, it curtly dismissed the demands of some gay rights organizations for expanded rights for gay men and lesbians to adopt children, saying only, `` The task force does not support adoption by homosexuals.'' The panel said it was preferable that a child be placed in a family of his or her own racial background, but adoption across racial lines `` should be permissible to provide a child with a loving, permanent home.'' The report of the 13-member task force, appointed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last August, was made public after the president, himself an adoptive parent, presented it to representatives of private agencies in an Oval Office meeting. The task force said about 40 percent of the 1 million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> teen-agers who become pregnant each year have abortions. Of the teenagers who have their babies, it said, at least 90 percent end up parenting them. `` A prevailing view appears to be that if a woman does not get an abortion, she must want to have a baby and take care of him herself,'' the panel said. `` The option which gives life to a baby, while offering hope to the biological parents and joy to adoptive parents, is too often forgotten, ignored or misunderstood.'' The task force recommended that states consider a law adopted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that reimburses licensed, non-profit maternity homes for the costs of materinty home care and services necessary for a woman under 21 to carry her baby to full term. It also recommended that states consider legislation, which it said at least 20 have already adopted, exempting directors and officers on non-profit orgqanizations from liability suits unless willful or wanton misconduct is involved. It said such legislation is needed because adoption agencies have been hit hard by rising liability insurance costs. The task force recommended support for pending federal legislation concering social security benefits for adopted children and health insurance coverage for disabled adopted children. `` Children often remain in foster care programs for too long a period of time before a plan for adoption is developed,'' the panel said. It recommended `` procedures for more timely termination of parental rights, establishment of foster care review boards,, accountability and supervision of agency caseworkers'' and related steps. The chairman of the task force was <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Gall </PERSON>, counselor to the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> and the single adoptive parent of two children.

<HEAD>Price Declines Greatly Reduce Recoverable Oil, Gas Reserves</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> may again drastically lower its estimates of undiscovered oil and gas that can be recovered from federal waters, according to preliminary figures released Thursday. If the estimates are not revised during public review, the department would show 37 percent less undiscovered oil and gas both onshore and offshore compared with currently used figures. Part of the lowered estimates result from the decline in crude oil prices, which means small, high-cost reservoirs are dropped from the list of prospects because it does n't pay to recover the oil and gas there. Oil today costs about $ 18 a barrel, and the new estimates are based on that price. In 1981, the price was almost double that. Part of the decline, however, represents dry holes, notably in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. By coincidence, the new offshore estimates came the same day the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> released what it meant to be a cheery estimate of the nation's total natural gas reserves, discovered and undiscovered. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said these amount to a 35-year supply, 583 trillion cubic feet, at current usage rates and a wellhead price of $ 3 per thousand cubic feet. The current price is $ 1.83. In asking for industry and scientific comment on the new offshore oil and gas estimates, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declined to make comparisons with existing figures. Officials said they wanted to emphasize by their reticence the tentative, subject-to-revision nature of the estimates. But simple arithmetic showed the offshore oil estimate off 27 percent from the figure in current use and the gas estimate down 18 percent: 8.9 billion barrels of oil compaired with 12.2 billion barrels and 74 trillion cubic feet of gas compared with 90.5 trillion cubic feet. In March, preliminary new onshore estimates showed unrecovered oil down 39 percent and gas down 41 percent: oil, 33.4 billion barrels compared with 54.6 billion; gas, 254 trillion cubic feet compared with 427 trillion cubic feet. Combined, that means estimated oil remaining to be found dropped from 66.8 billion barrels to 42.3 billion and gas fell from 518 trillion cubic feet to 328 trillion. The current onshore figures were compiled in 1984 and themselves represented reductions from 1981 estimates of 55 percent for oil and 44 percent for gas. Current onshore estimates were made in 1981. Some offshore areas showed little change, but <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s federal waters were almost wiped out as a promising place to look. The new estimates showed no gas at all there, compared with almost 14 trillion cubic feet in 1984, and 900 million barrels of oil compared with 3.3 billion. Gas estimates for the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> were raised, largely because of the extension of drilling to deeper water in recent years: 64.3 trillion cubic feet compared with 59.6 trillion cubic feet. The oil estimate was down slightly to 5.6 billion barrels from 6.0 billion. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> oil estimates were about the same as before at 2.1 billion barrels. Gas of 4.7 trillion cubic feet was down from 5.2 trillion. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> oil estimate was lowered from 680 million barrels to 250 million and the gas estimate slashed from 12.3 trillion cubic feet to 4.5 trillion. A gas price of $ 5 would draw into the market only an additional 10-year supply, 174 trillion cubic feet, the study said. This fiure and other estimates would be `` substantially larger'' if the analysts had incorporated forseeable new technologies, but they stuck strictly with known technologies in the interest of being conservative, said the study director, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. The study made no price forecasts. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> projects that gas will rise to only $ 2.85 in 1995 and $ 4.02 in 2000. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a producer group, said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s findings were `` very positive ones for producers and consumers alike.'' `` I think the study is deceptive,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizen-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer advocacy group. `` It does n't look at gas at $ 2, which is a much more realistic price, and when you do, there is n't as much gas there.''

<HEAD>New Procedures Set For Inspecting Imported Meat And Poultry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New procedures have been designed to regulate the inspection of imported meat and poultry, including the permanent marking of shipments that fail to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standards, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. Each consignment that fails to pass <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspection would be stamped `` <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Refused Entry'' on each carcass or packing container, said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` This will help ensure that rejected meat and poultry does not get into the human food supply in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It will also warn other countries where the products might be subsequently shipped that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has rejected the items.'' Products that are refused entry must be removed from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, converted to animal food or destroyed. Previously, such products were identified with temporary placards and had to be closely monitored by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> employees. The new regulation, which takes effect June 12, also will eliminate a requirement that products refused entry be sealed before being transported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, since the permanent markings will serve to identify it. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said the new rule also reinstates the practice of `` controlled pre-stamping'' in which import inspectors can put their `` passed'' mark on containers of imported products before the inspection has been fully carried out. This procedure is especially useful at cold storage facilities, so that meat and poultry can be stamped and samples taken for testing and inspection. If there are no problems, the products do n't have to be handled again, he said. If the products fail inspection, inspectors can remove the marks and stamp the products indelibly as refused. In a related action, the agency announced a proposal to allow imported meat and poultry to be inspected only at the port where the products are unloaded. Currently, the products can be shipped across the country to another port for checking by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said the proposal, which will be open for public comment until July 12, would give federal inspectors `` much better control of imported products entering food channels'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Israeli Air Raid on Lebanon Wounds One Guerrilla</HEAD>

 Israeli warplanes blasted Palestinian targets south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Thursday while a Syrian-backed radical guerrilla leader was visiting the region. Police said at least one guerrilla was wounded. Six fighter-bombers took part in the eighth aerial attack on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year, police said. The Israelis rocketed and destroyed three guerrilla command posts in olive groves near the <LOCATION> Kharroub </LOCATION> region town of <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION> in three bombing runs, police said. <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION> is 16 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The raid began at 6:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes. The positions were manned by guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paslestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, police said. The group's 52-year-old commander, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, was inspecting the <LOCATION> Kharroub </LOCATION> region at the time of the raid, but several guerrillas said he was not hurt. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> is a former Syrian army captain. His group is based in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> and gets financial support from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. His fighters quickly cordoned off the stricken area and would not allow reporters and photographers to inspect the damage. But from <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, nine miles south of <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION>, smoke could be seen billowing from the groves. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the military command said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes raided guerrilla bases north of the southern port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and returned safely to their bases. The location would be in the same area as the raids reported by Lebanese police. Pilots reported accurate hits, said the brief communique. Guerrillas fired at the planes with anti-aircraft guns, but no hits were reported, the Lebanese police said. `` They appeared to have whisked their victims to a nearby field clinic of their own,'' said a police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations. `` We know of only one seriously wounded guerrilla. But there may be more,'' he added. The targeted group has claimed responsibility for an attack in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last November by a guerrilla flying a motorized hang glider. The guerrilla killed six Israeli soldiers and wounded eight before he was shot dead. In retaliation, a squadron of 12 Israeli fighter-bombers raided three of the front's posts between around <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION> on Jan. 3. Police said at the time that 26 people were killed and 30 wounded in that raid, the first on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1988. In all, 49 people have been killed and 71 wounded in Israeli air raids on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The last one was carried out by helicopter gunships against the south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Kabrikha </LOCATION> on May 9.

<TEXT>
 Children's advocates on Thursday announced a `` Safe Kids'' campaign designed to combat the leading killer of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children _ injuries that can be prevented. `` Preventable injuries are epidemic in this country ... -LRB- these -RRB- things are preventable and that's what people have to be made aware of,'' actress <ORGANIZATION> Markie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Night Court'' said at a press conference. `` We've got to change our vocabulary and priorities with children now,'' she said `` We need to become more child-oriented.'' Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., who has scheduled hearings on the issue, said surveys show that most parents would identify drug abuse and kidnapping as the major concerns about their child's <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said 67 children in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> were abducted last year and 57 died from drug abuse, while nearly 8,000 children aged 14 and under were killed and 50,000 were permanently disabled as a result of avoidable accidents. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, nearly half the deaths of children aged 14 and under are caused by unintentional injuries. The Safe Kids campaign was developed by <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and is supported by <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> serves as honorary chairman of the national campaign. More than 40 health, corporate and children's organizations have joined the campaign, with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expected to sign a proclamation designating May 16-22 as National Safe Kids Week. Public service announcements featuring Ms. <PERSON> Post </PERSON> will begin airing nationwide on Monday, inviting listeners to call 800-365-KIDS to request a 16-page safety booklet. The publication advises parents on how to protect children from injury in five leading risk areas: traffic accidents, drownings, burns and scalds, choking and poisoning, and falls. The booklet also urges parents to take first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation courses to enable them to provide immediate proper care if an injury does occur. Safe Kids groups in 24 cities will host injury prevention activities next week. `` This campaign has set an ambitious goal _ to change the way <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> thinks about and deals with the epidemic of preventable injuries to children,'' said <PERSON> Herta </PERSON> <PERSON> Burbach </PERSON> <PERSON> Feely </PERSON>, executive director of the campaign. `` The fact is we have not done and we are not doing everything that we can to prevent childhood injuries either as individuals, the community or as a nation.''

<HEAD>House Appropriations Subcommittee Cuts NASA Budget By $780 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations panel cut more than $ 780 million out of the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> budget Thursday and agency officials said the reduction could seriously affect the civil space program. In the markup of appropriations for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on housing and urban development and independent agencies approved a total budget for fiscal year 1989 of $ 10.706 billion. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had asked for $ 11.488 billion. While that subcommittee was cutting the budget, the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, Space and Technology authorized the total dollars that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had requested, making only minor changes in distribution of the funding. But this action will have little effect if the funds are not appropriated. The budget reduction by the Appropriations subcommittee `` is really going to hurt the program. There is no more slack left in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>,'' said shuttle astronaut <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, on assignment in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s congressional relations office `` Something will have to be cut. There's nothing left. If they do make these cuts, some serious things will happen to the civil space program.'' In one of the largest reductions, the Appropriations subcommittee cut <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s request for the struggling space shuttle program by more than $ 200 million. The language of the bill would let <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> decide what shuttle program activities will be eliminated. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had asked for $ 3.610 billion to improve and start flying the shuttle again, but the subcommittee agreed to appropriate only $ 3.4 billion. `` This will be one of the toughest cuts to accommodate,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, a staff member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on space science and applications. <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> said some of the shuttle program items that could be affected include manufacture of spare parts, an effort to enhance the performance of the rocket engines and fuel pumps on the orbiter and the scheduling of missions. It would not, however, affect the resumption of shuttle flights. `` It's going to hurt them no matter what they do,'' said <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>. The space shuttle has been grounded since January 1986 when the explosion of the Challenger shuttle killed seven crew members. The winged spacecraft fleet is scheduled to resume flights in August. Appropriations subcommittee members also cut $ 65 million from the $ 967 million <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had requested for development of the space station. <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> said the $ 902 million allocation would allow the space station program to continue will little effect. Other cuts, with the original <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> request in parenthesis, include: _ Advanced X-ray astrophysics facility, an astronomy satellite, $ 16 million -LRB- $ 27 million -RRB- _ Commercial Development Space Facility, a privately built orbiting factory that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> was to lease, zero -LRB- A $ 25 million appropriation from last year was rescinded -RRB-. _ Titan 4 launch rocket, $ 23 million -LRB- $ 43 million -RRB- The subcommittee also cut <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans to buy a Delta II and a Titan 3 launch rocket. The marked-up bill is expected to go to the full <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where it could be changed, later this month. It then must go to the full House for a vote before it can be considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it has approved and sent to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legislation that would require the president to notify <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> within 48 hours when he authorizes covert intelligence missions. The bill, which grew out of the recommendations of the congressional panels that investigated the Iran-Contra affair, was approved Wednesday on an 11-to-6 party-line vote and announced Thursday by the committee. It is similar to a covert-action measure passed March 15 by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on a vote of 71 to 19. A central dispute in the Iran-Contra affair was the approval by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of a secret arms-for-hostages swap which was not discovered for 10 months after it was authorized, even though the law requires notification of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` in a timely fashion.'' The congressional Iran-Contra committees recommended that the law be changed to eliminate all ambiguity. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills would require the president to make a written `` finding'' that any covert action is required on national security grounds, and to provide copies to the congressional intelligence oversight committees. The committees would have to be given prior notice of such actions, unless an emergency prevented notification. In such cases, the president would have up to 48 hours to get word to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The president also would have to tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> which agencies are to be involved in the covert action and disclose whether private third parties are to be involved, as they were in the Iran-Contra affair. Under the bill, a covert action is any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> activity, other than traditional military, diplomatic and law enforcement actions, designed `` to influence political, economic or military conditions abroad so that the role of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government is not intended to be apparent or acknowledged publicly ...'' As it considered amendments to the measure, the Democrat-controlled panel rejected an effort by Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., to leave an exemption from the 48-hour notice requirement The committee also rejected an effort by Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>., to provide for fines up to $ 20,000 and up to five years in prison for unauthorized disclosure of classified information

 A single-engine plane that ran out of gas barely missed a football field full of students before making an crash landing on the grounds of a high school Thursday. The two men in the plane suffered minor injuries, but none of the students at Bishop <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> High School was hurt, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The pilot did his very best and did an excellent job of getting around them,'' said <PERSON> Hynson </PERSON>. `` He was extremely low when he came in.'' The pilot of the plane was identified by the Fire Department as <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 45, and his passenger as <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheeringa </PERSON>, 44, both of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. They were taken to <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for treatment of minor injuries. <PERSON> Hynson </PERSON> said the single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> came in from the east about 2:30 p.m. and circled the football field full of students as it descended. The aircraft knocked down a 40-foot flagpole, touched down on the surface of the track surrounding the field, leapfrogged at an awkward angle down the length of the field, and slammed to a stop in an embankment. It was prevented from going any further by an eight-foot chain-link fence at the top of the small hill that faced a residential road and a house across the street. The crash landing broke the plane's landing gear and smashed the aircraft's nose. `` The pilot did a fine job of getting past the football field into the bank,'' said Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutter </PERSON>, assistant principal at Bishop <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>. `` We had a class of girls out on the -LRB- football -RRB- field and a class of boys playing softball.'' `` They were fortunate in three things,'' said <PERSON> Hynson </PERSON>. `` One is that he -LRB- the pilot -RRB- could maneuver the plane.

<HEAD>Hostage's Sister Returns After Meeting With Released Frenchmen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said Thursday she learned from released French hostages that her brother, the longest-held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was told to pack a bag for his release just before three Frenchmen were set free. Mrs. Say, returning from a trip to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, said she was given greater access to <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials than she has had with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials since the beginning of the Iran-Contra scandal. Her brother, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Middle East correspondent <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, was seized in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> March 16, 1985. Mrs. Say, of <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, met with Interior Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON>, who negotiated the French hostages' release. She also gave a representative of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> a letter from a group of journalists working for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s release, urging the French to use their contacts to seek freedom for 18 other foreign hostages, including nine Americans still held by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` They told <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> he was going home,'' she said, describing diplomat <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>'s last moments with her brother after they had shared a room for several months. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> packed and was led away, she said, but it was <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, 45, who was released, along with diplomat <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>, 64, and journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, 44. The Frenchmen gave her other details about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages, Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said, but she said they did not want them made public unless hostage relatives agree. `` There's always a danger. The families have to decide if talking about it is worth the risk,'' she said. Meeting with the Frenchmen, however, gave her the feeling that `` he's okay, he's going to survive,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said the French hostages were released because <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was willing to deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and because the French government, journalists and people `` apparently place a higher value on human life'' than the Americans. The French deny that any ransom was paid. `` The French hostages had a feeling that the Americans had been abandoned,'' said Mrs. Say. `` The <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> people wanted the hostages released. They gave their government room to maneuver,'' she said, adding that the scandal over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms shipments to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in exchange for hostages has doused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> popular concern for their release. Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> claims that her government puts the highest priority on human life are inconsistent with the government's refusal to negotiate or give any concessions for the release of hostages.

 A federal judge Thursday refused to halt the shipment from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of two giant pandas to help celebrate the 150th anniversary of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> refused to grant a temporary restraining order sought by the World Wildlife Fund to prevent the two giant pandas from being shipped by air from <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> to this country on Friday. The fund and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums charged that the exhibition of the pandas would violate an international convention that prohibits trafficking in endangered species for commercial purposes. But the judge ruled that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate `` a substantial likelihood of success on the merits'' to warrant issuance of a temporary restraining order. The denial of a temporary restraining order can not be appealed, so the judge's ruling cleared the way for the shipment of the pandas. The pandas, which are set to arrive in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on Friday afternoon, will spend 100 days to 200 days at the Toledo Zoo. The plaintiffs claimed Toledo zoo officials were interested in the pandas only for their fund-raising potential. `` The Toledo Zoo does not plan to and indeed would not be authorized by the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to breed the pandas or to study them scientifically,'' the filing said. Instead it wants to use the estimated $ 1.9 million to be earned from the exhibition to improve a building, parking lots and other facilities, they added in a memorandum to the court. `` This is precisely the kind of commercial activity condemned by international law -LRB- and -RRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law,'' the memorandum said. Zoo attorney <PERSON> Randal </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Teague </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> said his client had spent $ 1.9 million to build a panda house plus another $ 1.1 million for ramps and other improvements at the zoo. The plaintiffs called the giant panda one of the Earth's most critically endangered animals, with fewer than 1,000 surviving in the wild. The suit named as defendants <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, because they issued an import permit. The memorandum called the decision to grant the permit `` arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and not in accordance with the law.'' Earlier, the fund asked that permits be denied for exhibitions of pandas in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. One potential exhibitor denied that the purpose was commercial. `` Certainly, we are not a circus, or a carnival, or even a zoo for that matter,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a whole string of hypocrisy involved here.''

 Mayor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> helped rescue a woman who was being stabbed by her estranged husband Thursday, chased down the suspect, fired a warning shot and then held the man at gunpoint until officers arrived, officials said. According to the mayor, police and witnesses, a man was stabbing his estranged wife with a long screwdriver in a car parked outside a popular restaurant when the mayor and others ran out to try to help the woman. `` I would not have shot the man,'' the mayor said later. `` I had this gun, at this time, for my protection. ... I had witnessed this guy trying to kill his wife.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohannan </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Altamonte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> was booked into jail, and police said he would be charged with attempted murder. His wife, <PERSON> JoAnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohannan </PERSON>, 23, was treated for multiple puncture wounds in the neck, face and arms at <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and released later in the day, officials said. A witness to the attack came into the restaurant to summon help, and recognized the popular, two-term mayor who was just about to pay for his breakfast and leave, authorities said. The robust <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, 53, described as a health enthusiast, and others ran into the parking lot, pulled the man off the woman and dragged him out of the car. The man came up swinging and slashing, narrowly missing in a swipe at <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, and then ran off. The mayor got his 9mm handgun out of his car and gave chase, first on foot and then in a pickup truck driven by another rescuer. The mayor jumped out of the truck as the man was running alongside a nearby ditch, trying to scale a fence. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> said he yelled at the suspect to stop, and when he did n't, he fired into the air. The man then stopped. The mayor and another man then forced the suspect to the ground, and the mayor held the gun on him until police arrived. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> carries an automatic weapon _ issued to him by the police department _ in his city car's glove compartment for his own safety, said the mayor's spokesman, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittiga </PERSON>. `` He was shaken by the whole incident,'' <PERSON> Mittiga </PERSON> said. `` He thought the man had a knife. ... We found out later it was a Phillips-head screwdriver.'' <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> told reporters he believed he had done the right thing in making a citizen's arrest because he is experienced in handling guns and said the man may have gotten away if he had n't acted. `` If the man had not had the weapon, if he had not made an attack on me with it, I would n't have done that,'' the mayor said. The gun `` was the only way I could get him to stop and the only way I felt secure approaching him. So if that was wrong, I'll just have to apologize for it,'' <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> sealed its pact with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, with officials saying that the research consortium is poised to help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claim the competitive edge in the semiconductor industry. The memorandum of understanding between the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, allows <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> to begin receiving the first allotment of a $ 100 million federal appropriation. <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> should receive $ 15 million of those funds in about two weeks, officials said. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said at a news conference after the signing that the federal funds `` were a good buy for American taxpayers'' and that the technological advancements by <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> researchers would create jobs and opportunities. Rep. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, in whose district <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> is located, said it had created a `` new and exciting partnership'' that will help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ease its dependence on foreign technology. <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> is a consortium of 14 semiconductor manufacturers, including <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>. It will develop advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, materials and equipment and will transfer research results to member companies.

 A lawsuit challenging plans to randomly test <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employees for illegal drug use was announced Thursday by a group representing 4,000 agency workers. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said its lawsuit, filed in federal court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, challenges plans to test 1,800 meteorologists, 1,700 meteorological technicians and 200 hydrologists for illegal drug use. The random testing is part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's program for a drug-free work place The suit is the latest in a series of court challenges to the government-wide drug testing program. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration last week submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a list of positions subject to random drug testing. Employees in those so-called sensitive positions were singled out for testing because, the administtation contends, their work affects the public safety. The suit, brought on behalf of 16 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employees in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, disputes that claim and charges that drug testing would be an illegal invasion of privacy. The suit said that for at least three years, the agency has reported no incidents of drug use or impairment by illegal drugs of employees on the job. The suit seeks an injunction to bar the testing.

 Afghan rebels shot down a Soviet helicopter gunship Thursday as <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops evacuated their biggest garrison in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> prior to the start of a Soviet troop withdrawal, guerrillas said. `` If they want an honorable return from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the Soviets should have talked to us,'' <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> told a news conference, hours after rebels reportedly shot down an MI-24 gunship in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> heads the seven-party <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. `` We consider the Soviet presence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> an aggression... that will continue until the last Soviet soldier is in our homeland Therefore fighting can not stop,'' he added. `` People coming from <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> say the Russians are sending their heavy equipment to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' said a rebel official identified only as <PERSON> Kabir </PERSON>, a member of the military committee of the <LOCATION> Yunis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khalis </LOCATION> faction of <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group. <PERSON> Kabir </PERSON> said an airlift was under way. A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, quoted rebel sources as saying the gunship had been shot down. No details were available. According to the sources, up to 60 Soviet trucks headed west Thursday toward <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, 110 miles from the <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> garrison. The diplomat said about the reported attack on the helicopter, `` It would indicate the Soviets have resorted to using close air support again during their withdrawal.'' Both the Soviets and the Afghans virtually stopped using their air force in 1986, because the Islamic, anti-Marxist guerrillas started shooting down aircraft with U.S.-supplied Stinger missiles. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the Soviet military charged Thursday that foreign sponsors have stepped up arms shipments to the rebels and sent in more military advisers, endangering Soviet troops who are scheduled to start withdrawing May 15 under an agreement reached in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last month. A civil war has raged in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since April 1978, when a Soviet-inspired revolution brought a Marxist government to power. About 115,000 Soviet soldiers intervened in December 1979 to help the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and stayed on to help fight the insurrection. Reports reaching <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said the Soviets' 66th Brigade, estimated at 4,000 men, will be deployed in the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> area after leaving <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 30 miles from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. An Afghan division will replace them. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is the second major garrison evacuated by the Soviets, following the April 22 withdrawal from <LOCATION> Barikot </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said 12 administrative districts and many military posts fell to the rebels in recent weeks. He said the government is vacating the areas since it fears that otherwise `` the Afghan troops and militia ... will surrender to mujahedeen -LRB- Moslem fighters -RRB-.'' He said garrisons in the south and north were vacated, and not just those in the east as <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> claimed two weeks ago. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said this was to facilitate the return of Afghan refugees from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. About 3 million Afghan refugees live in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and an additional 2 million in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A Pushtu language newscast by state-owned Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on Thursday, confirmed <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s assertion that evacuation of garrisons is taking place in a large part of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, not just the east. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> claimed that except for the <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> air base and the military outpost of <LOCATION> Spinboldak </LOCATION>, all of southeastern <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> province is under rebel control. He balked at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>'s proposal for convening a meeting of all parties to the Afghan dispute, so a government acceptable to the rebels, the refugees and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government can be formed <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> made the proposal in an article published Monday by The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is no place for such a conference,'' <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said Thursday. `` We will ourselves elect the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> which will form the government.'' <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> brokered the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord signed by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> which provided for Soviet troop withdrawal.

 A 450-pound Siberian tiger smashed through a reinforced window Thursday, dragged a veteran <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> worker into its outdoor area and mauled him to death, officials said. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>, 59, apparently was peering through a quarter-inch-thick glass-and-wire-mesh window when the tiger broke through and pulled him outside, zoo director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Werler </PERSON> said. The window was in a door leading from a hallway to the tigers' natural habitat area outside. `` At this time and until there is more information, we can not be sure just how the accident happened,'' <PERSON> Werler </PERSON> said during a news conference. No one saw or heard the attack. The 11-year-old male tiger, named <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON>, was isolated after the attack but was not going to be destroyed because it is a member of an endangered species, <PERSON> Werler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>, a 10-year zoo employee, was the first worker to die at the zoo. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, senior zookeeper of cats, said he realized that something was wrong was about 7:45 a.m. when he called to his co-worker `` and the tiger reared up and put his face into the door.'' It was unclear how long the attack had gone undiscovered; <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>'s shift began at 6 a.m. `` It cut him up and ate him up pretty good,'' <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> paramedic <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said, adding that's much of <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>'s left arm was torn away. `` He had numerous bites about him and possibly a broken neck.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dieckow </PERSON>, curator of exhibits and leader of the zoo's response team, fired a rifle into the ground three times to try and scare the 11-year-old cat away from <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>'s body Workers were finally able to force the animal back into its cage with a fire extinguisher, <PERSON> Dieckow </PERSON> said. Zoo officials praised <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON> as a good employee. `` I've known him for 18 years. I worked with him at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>. He was very competent. He knew his job,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Herwig </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>'s and curator of the zoo's aquarium for 10 years. The tiger was aggressive, <PERSON> Wehler </PERSON> said. `` It snarls and growls, and we have some cats that have neither of those dispositions,'' he said. But he said the tiger poses no threat to the public because there are three doors between the public's area and the tigers' area Because the Siberian tiger is an endangered species, the zoo would have to get federal permission to kill it, <PERSON> Herwig </PERSON> said. The Siberian tiger is the largest of eight kinds of tigers and can measure up to 13 feet and weigh as much as 720 pounds.

 A man accused of slaying 16 people was convicted Thursday and sentenced to death in the holiday season shooting rampage that left a man and a woman dead. He immediately asked that the sentence be carried out as soon as possible so that the `` torture and suffering within me'' would end. A <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated less than 1 -LCB- hours before convicting <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> of capital murder and five counts of attempted capital murder. They then heard arguments on whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison without parole, and later returned the death penalty. This trial, which started Monday, stemmed from a 45-minute shooting spree in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> on Dec. 28. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 47, is scheduled to stand trial again in July in the deaths of his wife, seven children, four grandchildren, and two in-laws whose bodies were found in and around his house after the rampage ended. They had all been shot or strangled. After Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> ratified the death penalty verdict, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> put on his glasses and in a calm voice read a brief statement asking that the sentence be carried out as soon as possible. `` It is my wish and my desire that absolutely no action by anybody be taken to appeal or in any way change this sentence,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said. `` It is further respectfully requested that this sentence be carried out expeditiously. I want no action that will delay, deny, defer or denounce this very correct and proper death sentence.'' `` I only ask for what I deserve,'' he said. `` Let the torture and suffering in me end. Please allow me the right to be at peace.'' Afterward, the judge said it was not clear whether <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> had the legal right to cancel the automatic appeal provided for death sentences in state law. Under <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> law, the death penalty would be carried out by lethal injection. Earlier, prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON>, arguing for death for the retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> master sergeant, had said `` there is nothing in the record that says this man is entitled to a break _ nothing.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, who had rested his case without calling any witnesses, asked the jury for mercy. `` One thing is certain _ <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> is going to die in prison,'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said. `` The only question is whether it is by our hand or by some act of providence or by a merciful God.'' Later, another defense attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, said they had urged <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> not to ask for the death penalty but now felt duty bound not to oppose him. `` He wanted the death sentence; he felt like he deserved it,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` And he wanted us as his attorneys to do everything within our power to see that he could get the death sentence, if you can imagine that.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was found guilty of capital murder _ the deaths of two people made it a capital crime _ and of five counts of attempted capital murder for the four people who were wounded and a fifth person who was fired at but not hit. Jurors reduced a kidnapping charge to first-degree false imprisonment and also convicted <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> of that charge. In addition to the death penalty on the murder charge, the jurors sentenced <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> to 30 years for each of four attempted capital murder counts, 20 years for the fifth attempted murder count, and seven years for first-degree false imprisonment. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> ordered that those sentences be served consecutively. In his closing statement, <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> argued that the state did not support its contention the murders were premeditated and that there were no tests to link <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> to the murder weapons and other evidence. But <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said such tests were unnecessary because of the number of witnesses and the testimony from <ORGANIZATION> Russellville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> handed him the murder weapon. `` The evidence in this case is strong; it's stout,'' <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said. Among the spectators in the standing-room-only courtroom were <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shields </PERSON>, and her husband, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, relatives of some of the <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' family victims. Tears welling in her eyes, Mrs. <PERSON> O'Shields </PERSON> displayed a photograph of one of the victims, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' 17-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON>. `` Is n't it a shame?'', she said. Killed were <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, 24, who reportedly had spurned <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' advances a year before the shooting; and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, 33, described by police as a chance victim. She was shot at the law office where she worked, while he was shot at an oil company. A state ballistics expert, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, testified that bullets that killed <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, and bullets found at a market where two people were wounded, had been fired by the same nine-shot revolver that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> handed to police when he surrendered. The trial was moved to Ozark because of extensive pretrial publicity.

 Was <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> responsible for smuggling tons of cocaine into this country from his native <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, or was he victimized by a group of deceitful American smugglers who are cooperating with prosecutors to reduce their own legal problems? Those are the contrasting points of view advanced by attorneys for the government and defense in closing arguments in <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial on cocaine-smuggling charges <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, in his rebuttal arguments Thursday, said <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> wore masks `` that have been stripped away by the evidence.'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> was scheduled to finish his arguments Friday morning and the jury was expected to get the case later in the day. He blasted closing arguments by defense attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>, saying it was an `` attempt to plant a seed of doubt in your mind that is not there.'' `` All he wants to do is to create doubt in one person's mind because your verdict has to be unanimous,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> told jurors. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, and co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, are on trial on charges they conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> via <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s private Bahamian island, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, from 1978 to 1980. The prosecutor contends the Colombian was responsible for smuggling 18,000 kilograms into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and had earned $ 20 million. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> challenged arguments by defense attorneys that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was victimized by convicted drug smuggler <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and members of his American organization. `` <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was just another pilot,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> ended his arguments for <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> on Thursday by telling the jury to `` do what you feel is right.'' The jury must not condemn <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> based on the prosecution's attacks on his character, said <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>, but must stick to the specific charges contained in the 11-count indictment <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> spent the morning again hammering away at what he said were inconsistencies in the testimony of government witnesses, many of whom were admitted smugglers given immunity for their testimony. Later, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said, `` The attack on the credibility of the witnesses is this case is so much sound and fury.'' <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> had said the chief prosecution witness, convicted smuggler <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, was `` given the break of a lifetime'' for his testimony against <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, getting a possible 215-year sentence and $ 5.9 million fine cut to less than six years in prison. <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> went through what he termed `` the litany of lies'' testified to by several members of <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s group of American smugglers. `` These people planned to dump on Mr. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>. These people knew how to get an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> card to freedom,'' he said. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, who officials have said was a key member of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s violent <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise He was arrested near the Colombian town of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> in February 1987 after a shootout and was immediately flown to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for trial. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is charged with smuggling conspiracy.

However, that is not what I want. `` I believe now and always have in the death penalty. To those who oppose the death penalty, I say, in my particular case, anything short of death would be cruel and unusual punishment. `` I am of sound mind and body and have been seen by psychoanalysts who can verify that I am capable of making a clear and rational decision. I have given clear and careful thought and consideration so there is nothing that will cause me to change my mind. `` I only ask for what I deserve. Let the torture and suffering in me end. Please allow me the right to be at peace.''

 Five people were arrested Thursday on charges of running a treasure-hunting scam that fleeced 700 investors of $ 1.7 million. `` This was a treasure salvage company, but the only treasure found was the money that was taken from the pockets of investors,'' state Comptroller <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. The three companies accused of wrongdoing traded on the success of the treasure-hunter <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who found Spanish treasure ships off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> and retrieved gold and jewels worth millions of dollars, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` The people bought a ship from <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> and they bought apparently a small amount of treasure so they could show this and use it and use <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s name,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the operators falsely claimed they found three wrecks. No treasure-hunting was ever done and no treasure was found, he said. Instead, the defendants pocketed investors' money, and it is unlikely they will get any of it back, the comptroller said. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> is not involved in any of the operations and is not accused of any wrongdoing, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. The five people arrested were indicted by a grand jury May 5 on charges of fraud, sale of unregistered securities and racketeering. The three agencies that announced the arrests also are investigating as many as 15 other treasure-hunting operations seeking investors with `` treasure fever,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. Most of the bogus operations are in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but a few are out of state. Most of those under investigation also have been trading on <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s success.

 The White House said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was immersed in diplomatic `` plea bargaining'' aimed at coaxing <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power, while a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney urged that the drug indictments against the Panamanian ruler be prosecuted rather than dropped. `` We're still talking,'' chief presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` What this amounts to is a plea bargain.'' `` Maybe something will come of it and maybe something will not,'' he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, whose office obtained an indictment against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, met with Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and later issued a statement saying he wants to carry out the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> prosecution. `` I am authorized to say his views have n't changed and he wants to proceed with the case and he's ready to proceed with the trial,'' said <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>'s executive assistant. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declined to comment on the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> situation. <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said through <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, `` I presented my views,'' but he refused to discuss details. Administration sources said Wednesday the indictments against the de facto Panamanian ruler would be dropped if he stepped down and left the country for a year. The sources, declining to be identified publicly, said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> objected to the offer, which was approved at a White House meeting. When reporters pressed <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> on Thursday on the legal and other ramifications of such a deal, he said, `` I offer no definition of plea bargaining.'' He said no direct negotiations have taken place with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on the matter. The administration move reflected increasing frustration with the failure to dislodge <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after weeks of diplomatic, economic and political pressure. But it was criticized immediately. `` I do n't think you drop indictments against drug pushers and people suspected of murder,'' Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> briefing room not long after chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> talked sympathatically of arranging a deal to win <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> such a legal arrangement `` would be the most fruitful and productive plea bargain.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` obviously has directed the negotiations that have gone on there, but I wo n't go further.'' He stressed that there have been no direct talks between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. An administration source said Wednesday that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> accepts the deal, he would step down probably in August and would stay out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> until after the next presidential elections there in 1989. The deal was approved Tuesday at a White House meeting over the objections of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, the source said. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critica </ORGANIZATION>, one of his propaganda organs: `` There can not be and will not be a deal while aggression against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and plans for dismantling the popular forces continue'' to form part of the administration's plan. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> early last week and has been conferring with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his representatives ever since, according to administration sources who spoke on condition they not be named. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> refused either to name the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contacts in the negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or say what sorts of incentives were being offered by this country. `` You may characterize it as plea bargaining, but I'm not saying what's on the table,'' he said. `` We wo n't discuss who's directly involved.'' In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the federal judge handling the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> case questioned whether the government alone can drop the drug indictment. `` My understanding and knowledge of the law is that the presiding judge is not required to dismiss an indictment on the motion of the government,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> said. `` However, I am having the law researched further.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, said the Panamanian ruler `` always has believed that the indictment against him was a political indictment. So a dismissal of the indictment would have to be a precondition to any discussions.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, a onetime close associate of the late <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, has headed the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> Defense Forces for nearly five years. In February, he refused an order from President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> to resign, and then fired <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who has been in hiding since. There were earlier reports of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> willingness to allow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to go into exile without pursuing his extradition, and in early April, there were reports that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was advocating kidnaping. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> acknowledged April 9 that an array of economic sanctions, including the freezing of Panamanian assets in this country and the withholding of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payments to the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, have `` hurt the people more than they have hurt'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. NBC News, quoting an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official it did not identify, said Wednesday night that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had decided to support dismissing the indictments after <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> advisers warned that further delay in getting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out could lead to a political alliance between <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cstro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> would not comment on that. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was n't alone Thursday in reacting to the possibility of dropping the indictments. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said if descriptions of the offer were accurate, it would appear to be a victory for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, allowing his loyalists to retain control while he spent `` a year's vacation on the <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>. `` If I was a cop in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> or somewhere, I'd sit there and say this administration has sent a signal that crime does pay,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said in a CBS interview. Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said, `` I think it'd be a terrible mistake to take the word of a drug-dealing killer dictator that he's going to get out and allow free elections sometime next year, and he'd be allowed to stay in until August. And the only thing you're going to have is a transferance of power to his cronies.'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said of the administration's dealings with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>: `` What we have here is an administration that's set its hair on fire and is trying to put it out with a hammer.'' Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s opponents can not accept the dropping of charges without any arrangements made for next year's election, the restructuring of the defense forces <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> controls or the setting up of a government of reconciliation

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers prohibited residents from leaving the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Thursday, trying to reduce the violence expected in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> at the close of the Moslem holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the people of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> bloodshed would end if they stopped the 5-month-old rebellion against Israeli occupation. The violence has taken the lives of 186 Palestinians and two Israelis. The Israeli air force made its eighth raid into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year, attacking <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> targets south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Lebanese police said six fighter-bombers took part in the attack at <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION>, 16 miles outside <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. An Israeli army spokesman said the ban on leaving the coastal <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where 600,000 Palestinians live, began at 10 p.m. and would last `` until further notice.'' He said the closure did not apply to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, home to about 900,000 Palestinians, but police spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidoth </PERSON> said extra soldiers were at roadblocks between the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Holy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and they were being `` more strict.'' Closing off <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> was intended to to lessen the potential for violence during the period beginning with the Moslem `` Night of Fate'' Thursday and continuing through Friday, the last Moslem sabbath of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. Israeli officials have expressed fear that mass prayer services Thursday and Friday on sacred <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> would lead to riots in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> means Noble Enclosure and is the Arab name for <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>. The ban also might run through the last day of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> early next week. The holy month ends Monday or Tuesday, depending on when the new moon is sighted. Tens of thousands of Moslem worshipers traditionally come to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> for the `` Night of Fate,'' marking the revelation of the holy Koran to the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. More come for sabbath prayers on the final Friday of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said about 10,000 worshipers prayed Thursday night at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, site of the Dome of the Rock and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosques. It said several hundred raised the outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag, chanted slogans and threw stones at military police, who responded with rubber bullets. Reports by the state and <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radios </ORGANIZATION> said a policeman was hit in the head by a stone and 38 Palestinians were arrested. There were no reports of Arab wounded. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said police and troops would turn back groups of Palestinians trying to enter the city Thursday and Friday in an effort to reduce the crowds on <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, which also is sacred to Jews. About 3,000 police began patrolling the hill and surrounding areas. Residents reported a huge police presence in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s police commissioner, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON>, said `` all necessary measures'' would be taken to prevent disturbances. Officials also are worried about violence Sunday. Israelis will honor both the nation's 40th anniversary and the 21st anniversary of the seizure of <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, when the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> were captured. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the army had decided to begin re-opening <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools early next week. It said elementary schools would open first, followed by the higher levels if no disturbances occurred. An army spokesman said he could not comment on the report. The schools were closed Feb. 2 because they had become rallying points for protesters. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said about 200 prisoners in the occupied territories would be freed Friday as a goodwill gesture for the close of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. The army spokesman confirmed prisoners would be released but said he did not know how many. Soldiers fired on Palestinian protesters in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, wounding five, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. The army reported three wounded. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, the second largest city in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, for the first time since violence began in the occupied territories Dec. 8, and toured the open-air market. He appealed through an interpreter for an end to the violence and an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> rejoined: `` The government should start treating the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> as human beings, especially now during religious celebrations.'' The prime minister's reply: `` The population should start to behave, and not only during holidays. If there would be quiet and order, nothing would be done against the population.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday was trying to find a way to increase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military involvement in the war against illegal drugs, but bogged down in a dispute over whether to give the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> new powers to arrest drug traffickers in international waters. The dispute centered around a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill, which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is trying to finish. The argument over the anti-drug provision is the major remaining hurdle and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders said they do n't expect to pass the bill before Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> attended a closed-door series of meetings at the Capitol to discuss the anti-drug plans, which have been proposed in response to what legislators say is public demand to do more to halt drug-trafficking. `` We're all looking for a way to have the military more involved in a meaningful way in the war against drugs,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the chief author of one anti-drug proposal The bill authorizes defense spending in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 of $ 299.5 billion, the same total contained in a separate Pentagon budget bill passed Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Differences between the measures will be worked out later by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. The House bill contains a provision ordering President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to have the military `` substantially halt'' the penetration of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders by ships and planes carrying illegal drugs. The plan proposed by <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> is not as far reaching, but it would make the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> the chief federal agency in halting illegal drug-trafficking, and also would have the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> provide more coordination and communications to other drug-fighting agencies such as the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Making the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> the chief federal agency for anti-drug efforts would mean it would have to approve actions by all other federal agencies. Another proposal authored by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., and <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, would allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel to make anti-drug arrests outside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders, such as beyond the three-mile limit recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said they were trying to craft their separate proposals into a single bill, but the main sticking point was over whether to give the military arrest powers in international waters. The plan will not be approved before Friday, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. Asked about the reaction of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said, `` They're not happy. ... They're not doing cartwheels.'' The military is now barred from enforcing civilian laws by the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law enacted to halt the practice of having the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> enforce laws in the post-Civil War southern states. That law was amended in 1981 to permit the military to provide some aid, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military surveillance information is now passed along to some civilian agencies. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials now travel aboard <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships patrolling the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has offered to have the Pentagon do more in the anti-drug effort, although he opposes having the military make arrests. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said Thursday that the military can slow, but not halt, the flow of drugs. `` If the effort here is to reduce the amount of drugs coming into this country, it can be done,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` If the effort is expected to stop drugs coming into this country, it can not be done. Unless you do it on the demand side, ways will be found.'' The military can track planes, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> noted, but `` it's difficult to tell the difference between a civilian flight and one that is engaged in drug smuggling. `` We have ample military resources to be able to stop every aircraft at our border, but in fact that's a much more complex problem than I think most people realize,'' he said. As it worked through the bill Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: _ Voted 57-39 to kill an effort to ban most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> underground nuclear testing The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in its version of the bill, approved an underground test ban, meaning the issue will have to be resolved by the conference committee. _ Voted 64-32 to restore a `` Buy America'' requirement which requires the Petnagon to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products, including anthracite coal The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> says it already has a four-year supply of the coal and does n't need any more. _ Killed, on a 60-37 vote, a proposal that would have halted the sending of any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat troops to leftist-ruled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or its neighbor, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> The troop ban was approved last week by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, meaning the issue will have to be decided by the conference. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said repeatedly the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no intention of sending combat troops to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. _ Killed, on a 61-36 vote, a plan to reduce spending for the railroad version of the MX nuclear-tipped missile from $ 700 million to $ 200, using the extra $ 500 million to buy more non-nuclear weapons The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposes to spend only $ 100 million for the rail version of the MX. _ Rejected, 82-13, the latest proposal to have the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> express a formal opinion on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> policy The amendment would have required a detailed report from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> outlining his plans for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> involvement in the war-torn region, and would have given <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> 15 days after that to formally vote on the policy.

<HEAD>Illinois Bell Says Weeks Required To Restore Service After Fire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Phone service to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s western suburbs will not be fully restored until late in June following a fire at a switching station that caused the worst service disruption in the company's history, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of operations, said `` significant progress'' has been made in restoring telephone circuits passing through its west suburban <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> switching center, which was heavily damaged by fire Sunday. But he told a news conference it would take at least until the third week in June before all 35,000 customers affected by the outage have full service. Phones in all or parts of six western suburbs have been dead since the fire. `` This was the most severe service disruption <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> has had in its history,'' <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON> said of the 107-year-old company. `` The scope and complexity of the repair work far exceeds anything we've had in the past ... and that includes any natural disasters. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> investigators have still not determined the cause of the fire. By overhauling damaged local switching equipment as a stopgap measure, the phone company hoped to restore 21,000 service lines by Sunday, <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON> said. But he cautioned that this was the most optimistic projection. <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON> said he could not guarantee the old equipment would hold up against corrosion caused by the chemical reaction from smoke and water sprayed by firefighters. Emergency service to hospitals, police and fire departments, the company's first priority, may be back in service in the next couple of days, <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> employees were working round-the-clock Thursday to install new equipment, which should be in place by June 1, although it will take another three weeks to restore service to all local residents, <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON> said. It normally takes 50 weeks to install a completely new system. The telephone company was having more success in repairing damage to 13,000 special lines used by businesses and the `` trunking service'' knocked out by the fire at the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> station. About half of the trunking service had been restored by Thursday, and all 118,000 circuits connecting the western and southwestern suburbs with the rest of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> metropolitan area and long distance providers should be back in service by late Sunday, <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON> said. He expected that the business service lines would be fully back in operation by the end of next week. Special service lines are used by business customers for a variety of purposes, including data transmission. <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON> acknowledged a considerable delay in the time between when the fire was first reported at the unmanned switching station and the arrival of firefighters to fight the blaze. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> received an alarm at 3:50 p.m. at a monitoring station in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, more than 150 miles away, but it was not until 4:20 p.m. that a full fire alarm sounded, <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON> said. After another 30 minutes, an employee arrived to check out the alarm, but he had to hail down a passing motorist to alert firefighters because the phones were already out of service. Firefighters did not arrive at the scene until after 5 p.m. The phone company was reviewing its fire prevention measures in light of the fire, <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, residents were trying to cope as best as possible with the lack of phone service. People lined up at mobile trailers with public coin phone stations at six locations in the western suburbs. `` I ` ts been very inconvenient,'' said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthick </PERSON>, assistant editor of a telecommunications trade paper in `` I've been doing all my phone work from my home in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Chinese Herbs, Antiseptics Join Dental Arsenal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. DICKERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chinese herbs and antiseptics are the newest weapons in the war against cavities and gum disease, researchers said Thursday. ` They're as common as the common cold,'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> microbiologist <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> said of gum problems and tooth decay. Speaking at the 88th annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION>, she said her study involved having patients with gum disease dip special toothbrushes in a mild prescription antibiotic called chlordexidine, and then brush. Within one to three weeks, plaque-causing bacteria decreased, she said. ` This is an attempt to combine treatments, a mechanical cleaning with the use of a mild antiseptic,'' she said. ` The up-and-down scraping dislodge the bacteria.'' The seven patients in the test group used tiny, Christmas-tree-shaped brushes designed to get the antibiotic solution in pockets of infection near tooth roots. They use the technique in conjunction with regular brushing, said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, who hopes to soon launch a larger study. Extracts of plants used in Chinese folk medicine also appear promising in the fight against tooth decay and gum disease, said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> microbiologist <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wu-Yuan </PERSON>. She started her research after a 1984 trip to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, where dentists prescribe herbs for patients. `` They know it works, but they do n't know why it works,'' she said. ` Chinese folk medicine is rich with plant-derived products used to treat gum disease and maintain oral health. We looked at herbs that can affect cavities and gum disease.'' She pulverized 40 kinds of plants that she found in Chinese markets in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and mixed the extracts with bacteria commonly found in mouths. Forty-two percent of the extracts inhibited bacterial growth, including 10 percent that outright killed the germs, she said. She refused to name the plants used, saying corporations are pressing her for that information. Ms. <PERSON> Wu-Yuan </PERSON> said the next step is further research on the promising extracts _ using patients instead of bacteria _ and fine-tuning the amounts that could be used in a toothpaste or mouthwash. ` A lot of the time with gum disease, there are no symptoms, so people do n't take it seriously'' until their teeth are in danger of falling out, she said.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Official Says Humanitarian Aid To Rebels OK</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nicaraguan Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said Thursday his government is willing to allow immediate delivery of humanitarian supplies to rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and he denied his government is trying to starve the Contras into submission. `` We are in full disposition to accept that the Contra forces could receive humanitarian aid inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> tomorrow, if possible,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> told reporters after a 1 -LCB- - hour meeting with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and other Democratic congressional leaders `` We are not trying to gain this war through starvation,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. The visit appeared to be in part an effort to counter <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration accusations that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government is dragging its feet in peace talks to delay food and medical supplies destined for the rebels under a $ 48 million aid package passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. `` There were some things necessary to clarify here about the serious attitude of the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'' toward permitting the rebels to receive non-military supplies, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. A temporary cease-fire agreement in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s seven-year war reached March 23 called for aid to the Contras to be delivered by a neutral agency, but there has been no agreement on who that delivery agent should be. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have proposed the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> _ `` the very symbol of neutrality in the world,'' according to <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> _ but the rebels have rejected that idea. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said he was meeting later in the day with Secretary General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> to hear his proposals for delivering the aid and said he would take that information back to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. `` I'm sure we can agree without problems'' on some way to deliver the aid, he said. `` If they do n't want to accept -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, we are willing to discuss other proposals.'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> also said he was confident talks aimed at reaching a long-term peace accord would resume soon. The rebels have proposed resumption of formal talks on May 19, but the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> want to schedule one or two preliminary private rounds of talks first. The 60-day temporary cease-fire runs out at the end of the month, and <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> reiterated his government's belief that some extension of the temporary truce will be necessary, perhaps for another 30 to 60 days.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday easily rejected the latest attempt to have the chamber express a formal opinion on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s expanded policy of protecting shipping in the war-torn <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 82-13 to table, and thus kill, an amendment to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill that would have required a report from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> outlining his policy. The proposal would have required specifics about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goals, anticipated length of deployment and the rules under which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons would be fired. The plan was offered by Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., who again criticized his colleagues for refusing to vote on whether the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approves of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s year-old policy <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a critic of the administration policy, told his fellow senators that `` for over a year we have danced around the issues.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy involves having the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> protect 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the gulf, which has been the scene of fighting in the long Iran-Iraq war. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> is an Iraqi ally. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy recently was expanded to provide <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> protection to neutral merchant ships who are attacked and who seek <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help from <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships. That expanded policy came in the wake of an April 18 clash between the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, in which the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sank or damaged six Iranian vessels. It was the latest in a series of military fights between the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has yet to vote formal approval or disapproval of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also has rejected <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' repeated efforts to invoke the War Powers Act. That is the 1973 law that would, under some circumstances, require the withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from situations of `` imminent danger.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has refused to invoke the War Powers law, arguing that it is an unconstitutional restriction on his authority. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and 110 other legislators have sued to invoke the law, but a federal judge rejected the suit and they are appealing that rejection. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., a former secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, led the opposition to <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' proposal `` I think it would be ill-advised for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to single out any particular military operation and say, on an annual basis, that we're going to appropriate money for that operation.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' proposal rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would have required the report from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and then would have provided 15 days for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to disapprove the policy. If no disapproval vote were taken, the policy would have been considered approved. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, criticized <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy as `` foolish ... stupid'' but he opposed <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' plan. He said it might mean that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces would be pulled out of the region. `` I do n't want to see us take an action in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> that would really mean we are willing to pull out,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., opposed the plan because `` this would require the president to be a prophet ... I'm not sure the president can provide a plan, given the fluid nature of events in that part of the world.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said his proposal `` is n't a withdrawal from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. ... I do not want to withdraw our forces.'' Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said the plan `` is another example of what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is criticized for. ... You ca n't have 535 secretaries of state,'' referring to the total number of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members.

<HEAD>Legislation Proposed To Strengthen Sanctions Against South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of senators introduced legislation Thursday to impose a virtual ban on economic dealings between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has indulged the apartheid regime for 40 years,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., the primary <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsor of the bill `` It is time to chart another course.'' The bill, similar to one pending on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> calendar, would force <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses to divest their holdings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> within a year and would ban most trade with and lending to that country. Other supporters included Sens. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, R-Conn., <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, both D-Mich., <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, both D-N.J., and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> `` This will end once and for all time <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> complicity in, and support for, apartheid,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said in announcing the bill at a news conference. While supporters of the sanctions are optimistic about <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passage, the bill's fate in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is unclear, in part because moderate Republicans who were key to the passage of limited sanctions in 1986 are reluctant to go along with harsher measures. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes the sanctions and a presidential veto is likely if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should pass the bill. Efforts are under way in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to enlist the two-thirds support that would be needed to override a veto, but that effort would be more difficult in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Police arrested four of <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s five high priests and 26 followers as they prepared to march Thursday to the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. Security forces killed at least three people at the besieged shrine. Indian commandos backed by paramilitary troops captured a strategic water tank on the temple complex grounds, where an estimated 100 Sikh militants have been holed up since Monday, officials said. About 2,500 police and paramilitary troops surrounded the militants at the temple, <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine. They have been fighting intermittently since Monday. The <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> government ruled out new negotiations with the militants and demanded they surrender. `` If they do not do so the state government will continue its pressure on them,'' <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> Governor <PERSON> S.S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said in a statement issued in the state capital, <LOCATION> Chandigargh </LOCATION>. Talks Wednesday on ending the temple standoff were inconclusive and a cease-fire that took effect that day ended Thursday morning. The militants have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1983 for more autonomy or an independent homeland for the Sikhs in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people but are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Three more people, two Sikh militants and an unidentified man, were shot and killed by security forces on Thursday, raising the death toll in the fighting to at least 15, said <PERSON> A.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON>, state police deputy chief. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said as many as seven Sikhs died inside the shrine Thursday. Indian commandos captured the water tank in the living area of the temple complex, said witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity. The priests were arrested as they attempted to march on the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> from another Sikh shrine about a half-mile to the north, <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON> said. The priests were placed in custody for 15 days on charges of violating curfew orders, <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON> said. Among those arrested was <PERSON> Jasbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rode </PERSON>, the temple's head priest, who held talks Wednesday with government officials to try to end the confrontation. Rode has called for the militants to dismantle their bunkers and for the security forces to withdraw. Deputy Police Commissioner <PERSON> Sarbjeet </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> had asked them to call off their march because two bursts of gunfire were reported inside the temple Thursday after an overnight lull. `` We take responsibility for any firing from inside the temple,'' Rode told <PERSON> Sarbjeet </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, insisting that the march should be allowed to proceed. `` You take responsibility for firing from outside.'' Firing from the temple increased as the morning wore on. Police lifted a curfew in most parts of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> on Thursday, but it remained in force within 200 yards of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, Indian television said. Most of the shops and businesses in the old sector of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> which surrounds the temple remained shuttered even after curfew was withdrawn in the area. Security forces for the first time Thursday began blocking reporters from approaching the temple. They said Sikh militants might shoot the journalists. More than 940 people have been killed this year in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> in attacks blamed on the extremists. Most have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs opposed to the separatist campaign. The confrontation at the Golden Temple began Monday when militants inside the shrine opened fire on security forces who had gone to a nearby rooftop to look at fortifications the Sikhs were building on the northern edge of the complex. The temple complex covers an area equivalent to more than five city blocks. The temple sits in the center of a pool. The Indian army was sent into the Golden Temple complex in June 1984 to flush out Sikh extremists. More than 1,200 people were killed in the attack. Later that year, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards.

 <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said Thursday an international appeal will be launched in three weeks for hundreds of millions of dollars for refugee aid and reconstruction. `` We must see to equitable distribution and certainly relief would be without strings attached and should not be used for political manipulation,'' he told a news conference. `` The important thing is that the aid gets to the people who need it.'' The amount has not been set. The prince, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> high commissioner for refugees from 1965-77, said he hopes to meet all parties concerned, rebels included. The rebels control much of the Afghan countryside and he indicated they could play an important part in relief distribution. `` I am concerned about the Afghan people as a whole and we need to find ways to get help where it is needed,'' he said. The 55-year-old prince was named Wednesday as undersecretary-general to coordinate all international relief efforts in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and resettlement of 5 million refugees. Facing him is the task of insuring that a vast amount of aid will be distributed fairly by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies. He must see aid is not exploited or manipulated by the pro-Soviet government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> or by the anti-Marxist rebels, who reject the political accord on withdrawing Soviet troops. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> mediated the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> providing for the 115,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to withdraw over a nine-month period. The prince emphasized that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief efforts are separate from the political agreement. Answering a question, he said he could not give the amount of aid needed for relief, reconstruction and rehabilitation, but it would amount to `` hundreds of millions of dollars.'' He said Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> probably will launch the appeal to donor countries in three weeks. <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said he will shuttle between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> from his base in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and that he will go to the area next week. He said his work will involve coordinating the work of many <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies _ including the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, the Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and others _ as well as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION>, its Islamic counterpart, and other groups. He said many governments already have indicated their willingness to make generous contributions and have been awaiting a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mechanism for distribution. He said his immediate task is to formulate an appeal and assure donors how their money will be spent. He said repatriation of refugees will be a major task and reception centers must be set up for displaced people wanting to return.

 A rocket fuel manufacturer Thursday blamed a natural gas leak for a series of earthquake-force explosions May 4 that demolished a plant, killing two people and injuring 326. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the high-pressure gas line passing through the plant had been leaking for at least 30 minutes before a fire broke out May 4 at the plant. `` All of the subsequent destructive events were caused by the gas leak, the gas fire and the gas explosion,'' he said. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said the leak is believed to have saturated the earth below the paved surfaces of the plant and ignited `` as a result of circumstances unrelated to PEPCON operations.'' Earlier Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bowed to pressure from the state and halted production at the only other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plant making the fuel component ammonium perchlorate until an independent inspection determines its plant is safe. <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> vehemently denied the allegation, saying gas mains under the plant ruptured only after the initial explosions. `` As far as we're concerned, our facilities are a victim of the explosion and not the cause,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hetherington </PERSON>. Fire Chief <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> said Wednesday that the Fire Department would withhold judgment until it completes an investigation of the blast, which caused an estimated $ 73 million in damage. A <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> official said he hoped the company's own plant could resume manufacture within a few days of ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer used in the space shuttle and in missiles. `` A prolonged shutdown is not helpful to any of us,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> director of governmental relations. `` I think Kerr-McGee has done the responsible thing in agreeing to suspend production,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, who had met with company executives two hours Wednesday. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said `` legal work was being prepared'' to force the plant to suspend production at <LOCATION> McKerr-McGee </LOCATION> before it agreed to the shutdown. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> said the company, which will continue to manufacture other chemicals at the <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION> plant, has contracted with an unidentified safety consultant to study the plant. He said the inspection could begin by Monday. Local and state officials had expressed outrage when the plant resumed production Tuesday of ammonium perchlorate. Plant officials had said last week they would not reopen until authorities determined the cause of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> blast. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> plant is completely safe. `` We are blameless here,'' he said. `` It is not our plant that exploded.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> announced the appointment of seven people to a panel charged with reviewing health, safety, zoning and insurance standards for industries with highly combustible materials. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> will be chairman of the the panel, which <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said will complete its work within 90 days.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday endorsed a plan calling for $ 4.3 billion in economic development programs in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> aimed at fostering peace and democracy. The 159-nation body approved the resolution by consensus only a day after a military rebellion was put down in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. That country represented the region during the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> debate. <PERSON> Nealy </PERSON> half the money, $ 2 billion, would be debt relief. The resolution puts the assembly's stamp of approval on an ambitious and wide-ranging program for regional reconstruction, emergency relief and long-term development that depends on the generosity of the international community. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have not indicated exactly how they plan to raise the money for the program. However, its coordinator, <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON>, has been trying to line up donors, particularly in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. More than 45 nations, including most of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, signed on as sponsors of the resolution. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, concerned about the plan's call for debt relief, was an exception. `` We take the view that the matter of bilateral commercial debt is a matter between creditor governments and creditor banks,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a spokesman for the British mission. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which did not commit itself to contributing any money to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan, shared <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s reservations about debt relief. Ambassador <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> reminded the assembly that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has given $ 4 billion in direct aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> since 1985 and contributed an additional $ 1 billion to international organizations active in the region. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is pleased that the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is on record as supporting what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been doing for the past decade in this troubled area of the world,'' <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> criticized the plan for being vague about sources of funding. Work on the development plan began shortly after five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents signed a regional peace accord last summer. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> development plans calls for $ 392 million to resettle the estimated 830,000 people displaced by the civil wars in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, and to provide emergency food and energy assistance. About $ 1.4 billion would be earmarked for long-term projects running the gamut from rebuilding roads to vocational training for the handicapped to encouraging tourism. The plan also calls for spending $ 600 million to revive a Central American common market.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> settled their differences Thursday on a historic treaty to scrap medium-range missiles and sent the agreement to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to speed ratification of the pact before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, winding up two days of talks with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, told reporters: `` We have reached a completely satisfactory agreement on all of these issues.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> postponed debate on the treaty Monday while some members accused <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> of backsliding and leaving loopholes for cheating. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the differences over verifying compliance with the pact were a result of implementing an unprecedented system of on-site inspection. `` Occasionally, they'll have an argument,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said of the technicians who will carry out the agreement to destroy 683 Soviet missiles and 364 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles with a range of 315 to 3,125 miles. `` That's life.'' He called the settlement he reached with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> `` absolutely satisfactory.'' It was initialed by <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>, who negotiated the treaty, and Col. Gen. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON>, the senior arms control adviser to the Soviet military. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> and Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security adviser, would fly to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday night to report to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. `` I think it will be well-received,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is scheduled to begin May 29. Chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> and Soviet negotiator <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> signed another document at the Soviet mission that guarantees any futuristic weapons developed in the intermediate-range also would be banned under the treaty. Two of the principal stumbling blocks to verification of the treaty dealt with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands to inspect Soviet missile containers big enough to hold only a stage of a rocket and the issue of how much access <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors will have to Soviet missile plants and bases. Other issues dealt with photographing equipment, updating data exchanged between the two sides and the size and weight of vehicles that can be inspected leaving Votkinsk, where Soviet SS-20 missiles are assembled. The pact on intermediate-range missiles is unprecedented in its provisions for on-site inspection to guard against infractions. It also is the first U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate an entire category of nuclear weapons. The document on futuristic weapons was aimed at convincing Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and other critics that the ban would apply to intermediate-range weapons that have not been developed yet <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> were taking the second document to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as well. While <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> obviously was satisified with the results, he said `` what the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> does is up to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' With evident relief, however, he told reporters: `` I hope I've heard the last of INF -LRB- Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -RRB- at these ministerials. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, at a separate news conference, said the Soviets did not view the differences as technical but as `` very serious problems that required political decisions.'' He added: `` And such solutions were found.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> declined to provide specific details of how the dispute was resolved. Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, however, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Soviets wanted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to destroy West German Pershing 1-A missiles, but were satisfied the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government itself would scrap them. After a telephone call to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side told the Soviets where the missiles are stored and how many there are _ 21. `` We got back to everything we wanted,'' an official said, referring to the range of disputes on INF. Another official, while not criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said all the issues could have been resolved quietly with the Soviets if they had not been made public in newspaper accounts. Regarding missile canisters, the official said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> inspectors will be able to look inside, but not take the parts out. `` They gave in enough,'' he said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` I think when the senators see it -LRB- the agreement -RRB- I think they will see that it was worked out satisfactorily.'' On a related subject, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> ruled out quick completion of another treaty to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range nuclear weapons arsenals by 30 to 50 percent. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had hoped to make the accord the centerpiece of his four days of talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Negotiations are moving slowly on how to verify the scrapping of mobile missiles as well as cruise missiles carried on warships and fighter planes. There is also a nagging dispute over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program to develop a space-based defense against Soviet ballistic missiles. The Soviets are trying to constrict the program, known as Star Wars. `` It's now clear,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` there is no way these questions can be shaped up and ready in time for the summit.''

 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said Thursday it was shocked by the sudden cancellation by <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s military government of a meeting between Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and civic leaders, including opposition politicians. `` For now, I must clearly state the astonishment caused by a decision without precedent in the exercising of the pastoral mission by the Holy Father,'' chief <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said in a written statement. It was the first time in 37 foreign papal tours that a government had scratched a meeting after it was announced. The Vatican statement was released as the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> arrived in this 9,150-foot - high university city <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is on a 12-day, four-country visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Police in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> interrupted a Mass Thursday and arrested the country's top opposition leader, <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, and six others including a journalist with the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION>, an opposition party spokesman said. <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and the others were taken into custody in <LOCATION> Arroyito </LOCATION>, 185 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, said party spokesman <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>. Police gave no reason for the arrests. The pontiff is due to arrive in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> on Monday and was scheduled to meet the next day with the <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a church-sponsored group of about 350 intellectuals, union leaders, business leaders and politicians. Those scheduled to meet with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> included representatives of political parties that are opposed to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s president, Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. The parties are not recognized by <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. In all, about 3,000 people were expected to attend the meeting at a government-owned sports complex. But <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s longest-ruling military dictator, canceled the meeting Wednesday, citing security reasons and charging that the encounter would be used for political purposes. An official traveling with the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> statement was issued in hopes the government would change its mind. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said the church was pursuing discussions with Paraguayan authorities on the conflict. In <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> officials vowed Thursday to hold the meeting at another location. Tensions between the church and government in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> have been building for some time. Bishops there have been increasingly critical of the human rights record and authoritarian style of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who took power in a 1954 coup. Through such groups as <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the church has been campaigning for a pluralistic system of politics. The <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station, <LOCATION> Caritas </LOCATION>, has given air time to opposition figures. In <LOCATION> Sucre </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> celebrated a Mass and visited a hospital. In his homily at the outdoor Mass, attended by more than 100,000 people, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> praised European missionaries who have worked in this predominantly native Indian country. The pope ended his day in the tropical city of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, where he met with cultural and intellectual leaders. <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, a farming and ranching center of 377,000 near the Brazilian border, is an important transit point for cocaine. In his meeting with the intellectuals, the pontiff said the Third World's `` brain drain'' _ the emigration of trained professionals _ is `` a reason for serious concern.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> added, however, `` we do not want to deny the legitimate right ... to emigrate.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, first secretary of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s legal <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and executive secretary of the country's principal union federation, told the pontiff: `` You give us hope so the people can continue their struggle.'' <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> gave the pope a letter describing the plight of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s workers and acknowledged the local church's support of workers' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, on his ninth Latin American tour, flies Saturday from <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, for a regional religious conference. In a <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> seminary where the pope is due to speak this weekend, armed pro-Cuba rebels disrupted a Mass Thursday, news reports said. Eight armed members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> seized the <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toribio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION>, demanding that seminarians, priests and others join their insurgency, according to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programas </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s leading news station. There were no injuries, the radio said. During the pope's last visit to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> in February 1985, the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group caused a power outage that cut airport lights as the pontiff's jet was landing in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The jet landed safely.

 Two Chinese men hijacked a domestic airliner from the mainland to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, where they were granted asylum, and the jet took the other 116 people aboard back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> early Friday. It was the first piracy of a Chinese commercial airliner to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The two air pirates carried two bombs and handguns. Some foreigners, but no Americans, were aboard. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 left <LOCATION> Chingchuankang </LOCATION> military airport in central <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> at 2:55 a.m. -LRB- 2:55 p.m. Thursday EDT -RRB- after refueling, a litle under six hours after it landed there, said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Pao-hua </PERSON>, spokesman for the air force base. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> later confirmed that the plane landed just over an hour later _ at about 5 a.m. -LRB- 4 p.m. Thursday EDT -RRB- _ in <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION>, a coastal city in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province where the hijacking ordeal began Thursday evening. <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION> is just across the narrow <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> which separates the communist mainland from the Nationalist Chinese island bastion of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. An official at the <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION> office of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s national airline, the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said the passengers were in good condition. The plane was operated by <ORGANIZATION> Xiamen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the national carrier. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the mayor and other officials met those returning on the plane and extended sympathy to them from Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. There are no air links between <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s Nationalist government claims to be the legitimate ruler of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and maintains no official contacts with the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the hijackers were granted asylum, and also said the government was opposed `` to any threats affecting commercial flight safety.'' It said the plane carried 107 passengers and 11 crew, including the hijackers. They were identified as <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, 27, an arsenal worker in southern <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province, and <PERSON> Lung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuei-yun </PERSON>, 26, a steel mill employee in <LOCATION> Guizhou </LOCATION> province, also in the south. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yizhou </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s national airline, sent a request before the asylum announcement that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> `` assist in a quick return of the crew members and all the passengers to <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION>, and hand over the hijackers at the same time,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> did not mention <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s request, but said merely that the plane was `` allowed'' to fly to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> _ apparently trying to avoid any impression of cooperating with the communist government. The plane actually flew to <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION>. The hijackers commandeered the plane soon after it left <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION> at 7:27 p.m. Thursday for <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, capital of neighboring <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said they carried two bombs and handguns, although initial reports had said the explosives were fake. Several Japanese and a French passenger were aboard, as well as many Taiwanese who were visiting relatives under a new policy that eases restrictions on unofficial contacts with the mainland. Reports on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s official television and radio said the hijackers gave themselves up after the plane landed at the <LOCATION> Chingchuankang </LOCATION> base. They raised their hands in `` V'' for victory signs as they walked out of the aircraft. Television said radar detected the hijacked plane when it crossed the <LOCATION> Penghu </LOCATION> islands held by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, and two air force F-104 jets went aloft as escorts. It was the first hijacking of a Chinese passenger airliner to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> but several military pilots have defected to the island since <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s Nationalists retreated to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communists. A Chinese air force squadron commander flew his MiG-19 jet fighter to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in November, becoming the sixth pilot defector since 1960. Thursday's hijacking was the second time a Chinese domestic airliner was forced to land outside the mainland. In May 1983, six Chinese who initially demanded to be taken to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> landed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. On Feb. 22, a Taiwanese man said to be seeking better relations between <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> tried to hijack a domestic <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s major carrier. Four stewards and two passengers overpowered him, and on Saturday he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

<HEAD>Repair Work May Have Sparked Blaze in Historic Building, Official

 Workers repairing the exterior of the Cabildo apparently touched off a blaze that destroyed a roomful of antique furniture in the building where the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION> was signed, investigators said Thursday. The fire Wednesday raced through the third floor of the wood-and-stucco French Quarter landmark that has served as a museum since 1911, destroying a painting and causing water damage to artworks and other items. <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s death mask and the bulk of other historic artifacts survived, said museum director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sefcik </PERSON>. Offficials refused to give a damage estimate for the 193-year-old, three-story building, which was undergoing renovation, and the contents. Fire Superintendent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrossen </PERSON> said that workers repairing the roof and waterproofing the walls apparently touched off the fire. An investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity said a spark from a welding torch being used on a gutter on the front of the Spanish baroque building could have started the blaze in the building's old timbers. <PERSON> McCrossen </PERSON> said he expected to have a report on the cause of the fire Friday. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said the building, the seat of government in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> under three nations, would be restored `` as soon as humanly possible.'' `` It's like somebody said: ` <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> was burning last night.' So it's important,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said he expected repairs to take between one and two years. Lost to the blaze was an 1802 portrait of <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Penalver </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, first Roman Catholic bishop of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, on loan from the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Furniture from the 18th-century French colonial period was stored on the gutted third floor. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said officials were trying to determine how to preserve historic state records kept there and were considering short-term measures such as erecting a temporary roof. The Cabildo was built in 1795 and served as the seat of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> government under <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the Confederacy and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was there that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> signed in 1803 the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION> that doubled the size of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Only a copy of the document is at the Cabildo, <PERSON> Sefcik </PERSON> said. Originals are in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The Cabildo was the third such building on the site to bear the name. The two earlier buildings were destroyed by fire, in 1788 and 1794.

<TEXT>
 The Elysee Palace on Thursday announced new Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s Cabinet, dominated by members of a previous Socialist government but containing non-Socialists, non-politicians and a former union leader. <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, secretary-general for the <LOCATION> Elysee </LOCATION>, read a list of 26 ministers to replace the conservative government of Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> was defeated in May 8 presidential elections, which returned Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to a second seven-year term. Among the top new ministers is <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jospin </PERSON>, who has just resigned as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He was appointed minister for national education and research. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> had called education and training a top priority for the new administration. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON>, a finance minister under the Socialist government of 1981-1986, was returned to the post. Similarly <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> returned to his post as foreign minister, replacing <PERSON> Jean-Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Raimond </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Joxe </PERSON> to his old post as interior minister, replacing <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON>, who had been known for his law-and-order command of the ministry. The Socialist government was defeated in March 1986 legislative elections which brought <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevenement </PERSON>, education minister in the earlier Socialist government, was named minister of defense, replacing <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Giraud </PERSON>. The government, expected to reflect the spirit of `` enlargement'' on which <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> campaigned, contained at least nine non-Socialists but only two figures who could be called centrists. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has moved toward the right, had made a point of appealing to centrists. But <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Juppe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s talk of reaching beyond the ranks of the Socialists was but a `` pre-electoral trap for fools.'' <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Toubon </PERSON>, secretary general of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s conservative Rally for the Republic party, said the Cabinet was `` a hard-core Socialist government.'' The announcement of the Cabinet, originally expected Wednesday, was reportedly delayed because of last-minute hesitation on the part of centrists wary of joining a Socialist government. Sen. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletier </PERSON> was named minister for aid and cooperation and Sen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Durafour </PERSON> was appointed minister of public works. Both were ministers under former President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing, who is from the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. They are both part of the center-right parliamentary majority. Among the non-politicians is judge <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Arpaillange </PERSON>, named justice minister, replacing <PERSON> Albin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalendon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauroux </PERSON>, who had been director of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Administration </ORGANIZATION> where most French politicans study, was named minister of industry and foreign trade. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chereque </PERSON>, a former union leader, was named minister for territorial management. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> said the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members would be announced Friday. The announcement of the new government came two days after <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s appointment by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> said earlier Thursday that he would not rush the process. `` I intend to do my work in a spirit of calm and serenity, listening to everyone concerned,'' he told reporters. He met twice Thursday with the president, who must approve his Cabinet proposals. Most prominent centrists who supported <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s conservative government have said they would decline Cabinet ministries in a Socialist-led government. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> would be assured of only the votes of the 211 Socialists in the 577-member National Assembly, but the center-right opposition parties have said they would not necessarily vote to bring down the new government. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has the power to dissolve the assembly, and public opinion polls show an early election would likely produce a Socialist majority. Officials of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s party as well as leaders of most of the centrist parties are saying they think legislative elections should wait at least until autumn. Pressure is mounting within the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, however, for an election next month. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Poperen </PERSON>, a member of the party executive committee, said in a radio interview Wednesday that `` logic and coherence'' argue for an immediate election. He was named minister for parliamentary relations.

<HEAD>Agreement Near on Shoreham Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The operator of the $ 5.3 billion <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant was reported close to an agreement with the state Thursday on a plan to abandon the power station without ever operating it commercially. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s backing, has been trying to scrap the plant because of arguments that <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> could not be evacuated in a nuclear accident. If the agreement is concluded, <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON> will become the first completed nuclear power plant ever shut down without operating commercially. The plant, commissioned in 1973, took a decade to build and ran more than 10 times over budget. Sources speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed a report in The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that the plan would have the state take over the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> plant from its builder, the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, then scrap it. The utility would pay the estimated $ 500 million cost of the shutdown. In return, it would be guaranteed rate increases of 4 percent to 5 percent a year for 10 years and would remain an independent, investor-owned utility. The state had threatened a complete takeover of the utility to force a shutdown of <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> confirmed that state and utility company representatives continued discussing the plant's future. He declined to say whether an agreement was at hand. `` There are some areas, important issues, which we have agreed on. There are still some critical issues that are unresolved,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>, a utility spokesman. A source close to the talks said a sticking point was the issue of a change of the utility's management, which <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has said must be part of any settlement. <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Bredes </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> opponent and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, said she was against a settlement with the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` From what I've heard of the proposed agreements, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> will continue to be held hostage by <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> rates and the company walks away free and clear,'' she said. `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is offering <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> better terms.''

<TEXT>
 A woman on trial with her three sons in the slayings of three policemen who came to arrest her at a motel was heard on tape Thursday vowing not to leave her room `` unless they take me out on a stretcher.'' The tape was played during opening arguments in the murder trial of <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> Easter, 69, and her sons, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemons </PERSON>. The July 9 shooting in <LOCATION> Inkster </LOCATION> killed Officers <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> and Sgt. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. With at least 115 witnesses due to testify and several hundred exhibits to be presented, the trial is expected to last three months. <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> played a tape made when <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, sent to the Easters' rooms to serve a bad-check warrant, telephoned <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, their supervisor. Conversation in the room was also picked up on the taped telephone call. Easter and her sons have said that the shooting erupted when <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> arrived at the motel after the telephone call, was abusive toward Easter, grabbed her arm, drew his gun and fired. `` You will be asked to judge who sounds reasonable, who sounds out of control, and who sounds ready for a fight,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told the jury. On the tape, the voice identified as Easter's insisted that the bad check charge is a mixup and asks an extra day to straighten it out. The speaker identified as <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said, `` I'd like to do that but they wo n't give me that kind of leeway.'' `` Talk to somebody before I call President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or somebody,'' Easter said, adding, `` I'm not going to go out of here unless they take me out on a stretcher.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said witnesses would testify that less than 10 minutes later <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> arrived at the motel, knocked on the Easters' door and walked in. `` Before the door is shut a barrage of shots is heard, maybe 30, according to witnesses,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. In their opening arguments, defense attorneys told jurors they should not be swayed by publicity in the case and talked about the prosecution's obligation to prove the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. `` We all know that <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Easter </LOCATION> has been convicted,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON>, Easter's attorney. `` The press has convicted her.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, insisted Thursday he will schedule debate on the US-Soviet medium-range missile treaty only after three <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees examine and approve a new anti-cheating But some senators of both parties objected, declaring it is imperative the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> begin work on the pact immediately so that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> can take a ratified treaty to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on May 29 for his summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> reported to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> believes he struck a `` completely satisfactory'' bargain with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on the outstanding disagreements involving the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said White House national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> will fly back from the meeting Friday to brief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders on what has been accomplished. If <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> can report that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> has confirmed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will live up to the letter of the treaty, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said debate on ratification should begin on Monday with the aim of taking a final vote before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will testify before his panel Monday afternoon and that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s bipartisan leadership and the chairmen and the ranking <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> committees have been invited to attend. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> suggested that if no further snags are uncovered, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate could open on Tuesday. But <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> insisted he will not be `` driven by a calendar date'' and will not permit floor debate to begin until the on-site inspection plan is reviewed and approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and Intelligence committees. `` We were told all the I's were dotted and all the T's were crossed,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` It was through the examination of these committees that it was found that this was not the case.'' `` If we make a mistake in this treaty and we find we have been hoodwinked or outsmarted, then you can kiss the next arms treaty goodbye,'' he declared. `` Let's do this thing right.'' But <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said: `` I want our committees which have the responsibility for taking the microscopic look at the fine print to have the opportunity to go carefully into this and advise the joint leadership if these agreements adequately resolve the problems. `` Briefings are fine but the final word will be what these committees have to say,'' he declared But Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> must do nothing to cause further delay and prevent `` this American president from being able to present before the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people this historic agreement.'' `` If he goes to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and faces the question of why he ca n't get ratification, I think we place the presidency in jeopardy so far as the success of future negotiations is concerned,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said `` Time is the commodity that's scarce now,'' he said. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> on Monday shelved debate on the new treaty to give <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> time to resolve a serious dispute over the implementation of anti-cheating provisions. The dispute centers on what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors will be permitted to see and what they will be permitted to do as they seek to learn whether the Soviets are living up to the requirements of the treaty to eliminate all medium-range missiles. Earlier, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told reporters a go-ahead for debate `` depends on who's giving the answers and what they look like,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to depend on the committees with jurisdiction to determine whether these matters have been resolved in the proper way ... whether these things that need to be fixed are really fixed,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` We need to stand firm on these things,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Soviets can not realistically expect us to now compromise away decisions which already have been negotiated and closed between the two parties.'' Calling the on-site inspection provisions of the new treaty the single most important aspect of the pact, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said that what happens in the next few days `` could be the beginning or the end of arms control.'' `` If the verification system is sound and stands the test of time, then the negotiations for future treaties will be given added chance of support and success,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` But if now, when we are just on the verge of approval of the INF treaty, we allow its verification provisions to be unraveled by the Soviets, then the prospects of sound future arms control agreements will be dismal, very dismal indeed.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the last-minute snag justifies the searching examination to which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> put the new treaty since it was signed last December by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The process, he said, uncovered a number of flaws and unanswered questions, including whether or not the pact covered futuristic weapons such as those using laser or particle beams. `` If we had rushed in and approved the treaty, say a month ago, and then discovered these ambiguities and contradictions, the level of confidence of the country in our ability to reach good, solid agreements with the Soviets would have plummeted,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said.

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> say they'll risk the loss of thousands of dollars in aid and take the state to court if necessary to keep the taxpayer-paid chauffeurs who drive two of its members to meetings On Wednesday, the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 36-1 to prohibit schools from spending money for chauffeur-driven cars for board members. The measure was sent to the House. Board president <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobbin </PERSON>, who does not use a chauffeur, called the legislation `` racist _ another example of Detroit-bashing at its worst.'' `` We challenge the state's authority to impose these restrictions on how we run our school system,'' she said. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, with an 11-member school board, is the only <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> district known to use drivers. Wednesday's action reinforced steps taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last year, when it told the district that unless it stopped issuing cars to its members or paying for their drivers, it would withhold money used for that purpose. The action reduced the amount of state money the district is scheduled to receive in June by $ 270,000. In addition, state Treasurer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said that until the drivers are dropped, he will not sign $ 30 million in notes for the district _ a move that could mean teachers in the 181,000-student district will not get paid May 31. The district has a $ 25 million payroll. `` The notion that the state will send money to local governments no strings attached is an outdated notion,''' <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said Wednesday. Board member <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> said that without a chauffeur, she would be unable to attend evening functions because she can not to drive at night. `` I'm not backing down,'' <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think he -LRB- <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> -RRB- has the authority to do this. This is a legitimate expense. I only use the board driver for board-related activities.'' According to a study by The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, the drivers for the district earned an average of $ 35,060. The average salary for a teacher in the district is $ 32,930. Nine of the board members stopped using drivers after the state's action last year.

Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, was found guilty Monday in the death of her husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>. She could receive up to life in prison at sentencing June 17. Court records show that Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> had settled a lawsuit against a company she alleged made a cracker containing the aspirin substitute ibuprofen. Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> said that she did not raise the matter during jury selection because she believed the suit involved a manufacturing mishap, not product tampering. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, did not return calls for comment Thursday. On Monday, before the verdict in the <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> case, Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> reported receiving an anonymous call during deliberations last week telling her that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had failed a polygraph test. That information was not admitted as evidence. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON>'s concurrence, allowed Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> to remain on the jury after she said could put the information out of her mind. Three days earlier, the jury had reported it was hopelessly deadlocked at 11-1. Soon after the verdict was announced several jurors identified Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> as the holdout. <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON>, after the verdict, suggested that another juror may have influenced Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> or that she `` contrived'' the anonymous call to end the pressure of being the holdout vote, hoping to be excused. At <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON>'s request, <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> ordered the jury back to court Friday to ask members if they were improperly influenced. Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> has said she reached the verdict of her own accord. Repeated calls to Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>'s home went unanswered or were not returned Thursday. In her own tampering incident, Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, a real estate agent, told police her mouth started burning after she ate a cracker in 1986. She said she found half of a pill in the uneaten portion of the cracker and vomited. A year later, Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> sued the manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The case was settled for $ 500. There were no witnesses, and <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> attorneys questioned whether the event ever took place.

<HEAD>Health Department Closes Hospital, Cites 12 Deaths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> closed all but two units of a large <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> hospital Thursday, saying inadequate care might have caused 12 deaths in the past year. The state stopped short of the most severe punishment, revoking the license of the <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giuffre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The hospital serves a predominantly poor area of north <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. An investigation focusing on 66 cases since May 1987 found 124 deficiencies, including 29 instances of unnecessary surgery and 55 cases of post-operative complications, said department spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Froseth </PERSON>. In 12 cases the patients died. In one instance, a doctor's untrained son assisted in an operation, <PERSON> Froseth </PERSON> said. Scrutiny in many cases fell on the hospital's namesake, Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuffre </PERSON>, until recently the hospital's executive director, and the board of directors. `` The hospital will remain closed until they submit a plan of corrections and we determine those areas cited as deficient have been corrected,'' <PERSON> Froseth </PERSON> said. He said no deadline was set. In a statement, hospital officials said that many problems already had been addressed and that they hoped to receive permission to reopen all units soon. The order allows the hospital's clinic and its drug and alcohol in-patient services to continue operating. It closes all in-patient acute care, including surgical services, the emergency room and the podiatric clinic. Patients already at the hospital will continue receiving treatment, <PERSON> Froseth </PERSON> said. Under an agreement <PERSON> Giuffre </PERSON> and state officials signed Thursday, the hospital's board will be replaced by May 25, <PERSON> Froseth </PERSON> said. Part of the state investigation, conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, determined that the hospital was ineligible for particiation in the Medicare program, <PERSON> Froseth </PERSON> said. However, the federal agency has not made a final determination, he said. The investigation began in February, the month the state closed the surgical and primary care units for three days, saying assistants and podiatric residents had conducted examinations, diagnosis and treatment and had written prescriptions for clinic patients without supervision from doctors. A federal grand jury also is investigating the hospital, focusing on financial affairs from 1981 through 1985.

<HEAD>More Than 150 Suffer Smoke Inhalation at Train Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 125 children and 30 adults suffered from smoke inhalation Thursday night after someone pulled the emergency brakes on an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train while it was in a tunnel near Union Station, sending exhaust fumes spewing into the cars, officials said. The first and second cars of the Crescent, which operates daily between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, were evacuated. Approximately 125 school children and about 30 adult chaperones who occupied the first two cars were taken to several area hospitals where they were treated for possible smoke inhalation, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, supervisor for the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s Emergency Ambulance Division The children and their supervisors had been planning to depart the train in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> officials said the students are from <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leaf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The Crescent departed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at 6:40 p.m. EDT going southbound with about 400 passengers and 18 crew members on board. It had two engines and 16 cars. `` At 6:45 p.m., as the train was in the tunnel, an unknown person for unknown reasons pulled the emergency brake,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. `` The train stopped with its emergency brakes applied in the tunnel'' as the second engine stalled or died. The train crew, thinking that an air hose that controls the brake system had parted accidentally, `` walked the train'' looking for such a problem, he said. After finding none, the crew searched the train's interior and found that the emergency brake handle in the first passenger car had been pulled, he said. Unable to release the brake, the crew shut down the remaining lead engine which was spewing out diesel smoke that entered the cars. Trains that leave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> going south immediately enter a 3,900 foot tunnel that roughly goes under the grassy mall stretching from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. Another Amtrak engine pulled the train back to Union Station, he said. By 9 p.m. buses were ordered to retrieve the children from the hospitals and take them to hotel for the night.

<HEAD>Police Announce Biggest Arms Seizure, Including Missile</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police Wednesday announced their biggest arms seizure, including a ground-to-air missile, and arrested four whites who purportedly planned to carry out attacks for the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> described the three men and one woman as `` a highly specialized terror unit.'' He said they were captured Sunday at a farmhouse near <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, where they had been staying since early this year. Police said the four had an assassination list of top police officials and planned to use the missile to shoot down a police helicopter at a recent fair. They said that besides one Soviet-made SAM-7 ground-to-air missile, the weapons seized included limpet mines, hand grenades, assault rifles, pistols, machine guns, mortars and explosives. In his statement, <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> alleged that the suspects were trained in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and had radio transmitters which they used to communicate with <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. The predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, outlawed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since 1960, began a sabotage-and-bombing campaign the next year aimed at toppling white-minority rule. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> did not release the names of the four. He did say the men were South African citizens and the woman was from another country he did not specify. He said two of the men were armed forces deserters and one was a former South African journalist. They had university degrees and were in their 20s and 30s, he added. The minister said police were investigating how the weapons were brought into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The South African Press Association, citing unidentified police sources, said a disenchanted <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> member apparently tipped off authorities. Police said the four apparently had no connection with <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosskopf </PERSON>, a white South African and an alleged <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> member who is the leading suspect in a March 17 car bombing that killed three people. <PERSON> Grosskopf </PERSON> remains at large. Apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused visa applications from six leading Vietnamese economists as part of a policy to pressure the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> government to end its occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Wednesday. The group included <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON>, a Harvard-educated government advisor who visited several <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> capitals earlier this year to try to attract capital and technology, officials said. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denied the visa requests on April 16 because the group was `` deeply involved in Vietnamese economic policy planning and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government policy is to isolate <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> politically and economically to force its withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Christopher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> invited the group to visit <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> and other institutions to talk about <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s economy and efforts to attract Western investment, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyon </PERSON>, consul general at the <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was acting under Section 212A27 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which says the government can bar aliens whom it `` knows or has reason to believe seek to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> solely, principally or incidentally to engage in activities which would be prejudicial to the public interest or endanger the welfare, safety or security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Communist <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and maintains 125,000 troops there, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates. <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> said <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> submitted a second application on April 19, this time for him to travel alone, and that application is being reviewed. The spokesman said that since Oct. 1, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has approved applications for a half-dozen Vietnamese government officials to visit the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and other international organizations. A larger number of private Vietnamese citizens have gone to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to attend medical conferences and the like, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said. He said he did not know of any other Vietnamese visa applications denied in the past 10 months. In the past few years, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has played host to many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen, relief agency officials, journalists and others in an effort to break its isolation.

 Bank customers with loans pegged to the prime rate are about to feel the impact of the rising cost of money, but economists say a big increase in interest rates is unlikely this year. The first spike in the prime rate since the October stock market crash was announced Wednesday by major banks. The rise from 8.5 percent to 9 percent heralded a period of more expensive loans for purchases ranging from plant machinery to homes and cars. The prime rate reflects the banks' costs of borrowing money and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates. But the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including popular home-equity loans.

We have a multitude of severe crises we have to face,'' acknowledged <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, the city's cultural affairs commissioner. `` Why should we spend our time and our energy on culture? ... What claim do we have on the city's resources?'' she asked the flock of the <ORGANIZATION> Abyssinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the city's oldest black house of worship _ the church made famous by the late <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. And then she answered her own question `` Our culture,'' she said, `` has been our salvation.'' In the six months since <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> succeeded <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> in one of the nation's most powerful arts posts _ overseeing a cultural budget that is second only to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> _ she has repeatedly argued for more arts money in a city where bridges are falling down, crime is ever escalating and level, untroubled ground is hard to find. She has also restored the morale of a department dispirited by the scandal that forced <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> out of office and rekindled enthusiasm in the arts community. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> recalled the black heritage she and the congregation share: music and art dating back to the days of slavery in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, and before that to the great kingdoms and societies of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. When she mentioned the success of the Dance Theater of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> and noted that 98 percent of the young singers in the Boys Choir of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> go on to college, the audience applauded vigorously. Later, in an interview, the commissioner said, `` I'm really trying to accomplish a mentality, an attitude about the arts that recognizes that it is one of the most essential services that the city provides to its citizens. `` The real challenge for government is not to let itself get overwhelmed by its problems _ that is, begin to seek out and carve out real resources for opportunity.'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, 40, does not underestimate the difficulty of what she is trying to do. When she became commissioner last October, she had hopes of doubling the department's budget. However, two weeks after her appointment, the stock market crashed. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> recently proposed that the agency cut $ 6 million from its current budget of $ 133 million for fiscal 1989. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> remains undaunted. Culture, she says, helps educate `` people who are going to be our leaders, who we have to think of as being the salvation for the city,'' and it helps in `` the reclamations'' of communities. Moreover, arts-related tourism is among the city's most important sources of revenue. During <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s tenure, the importance of culture as something that was `` not just a leisure time activity ... had not been conveyed,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, quickly adding, `` not that I was critical of her personally.'' <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, a former Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, was a glamorous presence at gala cultural events, and the public's interest in her put the relatively new and small Department of Cultural Affairs in the spotlight. The department is 11 years old -LRB- it had been lumped in with the parks department -RRB- and has about 55 employees. This year the department provided $ 66 million to 32 major cultural institutions ranging from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barrio </ORGANIZATION> for operating and energy costs. It also distributed $ 13 million to arts groups in grant money for programs or projects such as the Metropolitan Opera's free performances in city parks. `` I think <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> was very concerned about bringing some visibility to the agency,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, assistant commissioner for program services. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayworth </PERSON>, assistant commissioner for cultural institutions, agreed. `` She brought an immediacy, an understanding of the city's political life. But the controversy surrounding <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s romantic involvement with millionaire <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> took its toll on the department. She was accused of improperly influencing a judge presiding over his divorce case. `` It has been a difficult time for people here,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think there's any denying that going through something like what we've been through in terms of publicity has an effect.'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, the daughter of a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> family court judge, received a doctorate in humanities at <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where she wrote a study of the late American artist <PERSON> Romare </PERSON> <PERSON> Bearden </PERSON>. As director of the Studio Museum of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> for 10 years, she transformed it from a struggling community arts project occupying two floors over a liquor store and fried chicken outlet into a premier fine arts museum focusing on black artists. It has a $ 2 million annual budget and is the only museum of its kind accredited by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museums </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> also taught English literature for two years at <ORGANIZATION> Nkumbi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a school in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> for refugees from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Those in the arts mainstream are eager to praise her. `` She's intelligent, energetic and a compatible person,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, chairman emeritus of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing Arts and chairman of the board of the upcoming <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Festival of the Arts. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luers </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, said he's `` dazzled by her intelligence.'' `` One of the things that is difficult in government is to understand how museums work. She has come from a museum environment and she knows the issues. She knows the concerns, the weaknesses, the strengths,'' he said. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> knows, also, that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is the nation's cultural capital, and she is eager to exert <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s influence on the national scene.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> once lived with her husband and five children in the relative comfort of a village in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Today she lives in her nation's capital in a shack without water or sanitation, a refugee in her own country. A 5-year-old civil war in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> chased the family away from their home, along with an estimated 820,000 other people, forced from their homes into lives of poverty, hunger and social ostracism. Mrs. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s story is similar to those of many of the others. `` The army came into our village and took our cattle and killed many people,'' she said. `` My husband fled before me to get away from recruiters for both the army and the rebels. I joined him with our five children later.'' The Dengs are among the estimated 400,000 to 600,000 southerners who have crowded into eight camps around <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. They run in all directions, mainly toward <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s other cities, to become wards of an impoverished state More than a quarter million have fled even into neighboring, starving, war-torn <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Several thousand of those died because they arrived after long treks too weak to be saved. The refugees blame their plight on both sides in the war, rebels and soldiers, and the tribal and ethnic conflicts that are at the root of the fighting. About 6 million people remain in the south, where the population is mainly Christian and animist of African extraction. Sixteen million Arab-descended Moslems live in the dominant north. Because of the great religious and ethnic divisions between north and south, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> has been torn by hostilities in the south for most of the 32 years since it asserted its independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> on Jan. 1, 1956. But for hundreds of years before that, southern and northern tribes have fought over pastureland and water, northerners traditionally dominating as they do now. The current round of warfare began in the spring of 1983. The rebel leader, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, is fighting for a greater share for the south of development money and of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s potential wealth from petroleum and mineral reserves, mostly in the south. Southern tribes like <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Dinka </ORGANIZATION> form the backbone of his <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. The Sudanese army recruited <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> tribes and gave them modern weapons. `` In 1985, the government started a policy of arming <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> tribes to help in fighting the <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Sulaiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldo </PERSON>, a southerner who is a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khartoum </ORGANIZATION>. He told an interviewer the new automatic weapons enable <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> tribes to dominate in intertribal clashes. <PERSON> Baldo </PERSON> recently co-authored a book on an alleged massacre a year ago by an Arab tribe. He wrote that more than 1,000 Dinkas were burned to death as police and soldiers watched without intervening. The government denies the atrocity charges, maintaining that the victims died in cross fires. It also denies that it shirks its duty to displaced southerners. `` We give them help, but not just to anyone so that they do n't become encouraged and come to stay and be fed for free and not work,'' said el-Hag el-Tayeb, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s acting commissioner for relief and rehabilitation The southerners in the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> camps, he added, are `` people who used to be producers and are now just consumers. They affect the city's already taxed infrastructure.'' In the civil war itself, the <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> now controls most of the southern countryside, with government troops in control of a handful of large towns, diplomatic sources said. The fighting, nevertheless, has forced southerners to flee their cultivated land and their cattle. Non-combatant southerners who have remained in the combat area also are in a bad way, said a diplomatic source with access to military information. `` The <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> go on recruiting trips into villages and attack them if the villagers refuse to support them,'' he said. `` The army troops view most Dinka youth as potential <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> supporters.''

<DATELINE>CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of Moroccan workers are laboring around the clock to complete <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s monumental act of faith in time for his 60th birthday next year. When completed, the builders say, it will be the world's largest mosque. Growing at a frenzied pace on a concrete platform jutting out over waves breaking in from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, the massive minaret is already <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s tallest structure and is rising at a rate of eight feet a day toward its planned pinnacle at 576 feet. It will soon dominate the skyline of this huge city and the nearby <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> shore. It will be visible for 30 miles in two directions. By far the most ambitious civilian construction project ever undertaken in this North African Arab nation of 26 million people, the `` Great Hassan II Mosque'' is budgeted to cost at least $ 250 million. Gifts from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and loans from several Western nations are helping pay for it. Interior Minister <PERSON> Driss </PERSON> <PERSON> Basri </PERSON>, who is in overall charge of the project, said Moroccan businesses, private individuals and local authorities around the country will be asked to contribute toward it. The ornate building was designed in a modernistic Moorish style by the French architect <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinseau </PERSON>, 62, who has lived and worked in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> for the past 14 years. More than 2,500 workers are busy 24 hours a day seven days a week so <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> can consecrate the mosque July 9, 1989, his birthday. The site faces the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Because the Koran, the Moslem holy book, refers to God's `` throne over the water,'' <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> wanted the mosque built partly over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. `` The tremendous pressure of the incoming waves created our greatest technical problem,'' <PERSON> Pinseau </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Last year we measured one record wave that was more than 30 feet high. We had to build two enormous concrete ` combs' to break such waves and had to take other extraordinary measures to make sure the ocean could never rock the building.'' <PERSON> Pinseau </PERSON>, whose past designs include the former <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> building on the Champs Elysees in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and the spectacular governor's palace in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, said the 430,000 square-foot platform would contain bathing facilities for men and women, a Koranic school, a library and parking space for 900 vehicles. The main hall of the mosque will be big enough, he said, to accommodate more than 20,000 worshippers, kneeling. `` The whole of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> could fit inside the main building,'' <PERSON> Pinseau </PERSON> said. `` The minaret will be higher than the great pyramid of <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Casablanca </PERSON>'s main highway, the Avenue of the Armed Forces, will be lengthened to run in an unbroken perspective to the minaret. It will be a magnificent focal point for <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s largest city.'' Casablanca, once a sleazy harbor town, now has high rise hotels and office blocks that line the Avenue of the Armed Forces. The city has more than 4 million inhabitants. <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, said to be a direct descendant of the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> in the 38th generation, is <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s political and religious leader. The mosque's main entrance door to the west will be reserved for his exclusive use. At the east end of the nave, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> will have a personal place to pray. The exterior of the building is to be covered with white Moroccan marble. As soon as the concrete outer structure is completed, more than 6,000 craftsmen will go to work on the intricately sculptured interior and exterior decoration in geometric Moorish patterns. At night, a laser beam will shine from the minaret toward <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, the Islamic holy city in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Engineers at the site said the beam will be visible at night across much of northern <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. In hot weather, sliding panels will allow a large section of the roof to be opened with hydraulic pulleys. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> laid the foundation stone last year. It bears a citation from the Koran: `` The prophet said whosoever builds a mosque in God's name, God will build a house for him in paradise.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After six months in office, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> still faces trade disputes with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and has been unable to break the pro-U.S. mold set by his predecessor, <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>. His critics call his devotion to <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s policies his one big failure, while at least one admirer, <PERSON> Seizaburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, an adviser to the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said it is only natural for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to remain committed to them. `` <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> occupied many important positions in the Cabinet and the party, and he is committed to the policies of <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> said. But others see signs that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> finally is beginning to head off on his own course. `` I think he has not yet found his own way of solving problems, but he is on his way,'' said <PERSON> Rei </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiratori </PERSON>, professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Tokai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. But he added that one of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s biggest problems is `` the heavy burden left by former Prime Minister <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, especially with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Many Japanese feel <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> was too closely allied with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> himself has said the time had come for a change in Japan-U.S. relations. `` The international economic framework so long sustained by the overwhelming economic might of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is being transformed, and there is a need for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to join forces with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in supporting the international economy,'' he said in a policy speech. An editorial in the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> in late April called on <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to assert <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies. `` We want the prime minister to be aware that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has become an important pillar for the West,'' the independent liberal newspaper said. `` It is now time for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to assert its own diplomacy, independent of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' On resolving major policy issues, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has a slim record so far. He achieved limited success in resolving a trade dispute with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over lack of access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s construction market, primarily because of the major influence of one of his Cabinet officials on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s construction industry. However, talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials on liberalizing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s beef and orange imports broke down, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeking a resolution through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s administration was also unsuccessful in persuading President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to lift sanctions imposed last year on some Japanese products because of alleged violations of an agreement on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s computer chip market. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> also was unable to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from passing a sweeping trade bill that includes sanctions against Japanese companies. He is relying heavily on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto the bill. The prime minister's major test at home will come later this year, when the Diet, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s national legislature, considers a tax reform package that <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> desperately wanted, but was unable to get. Many Japanese say the current tax system is unfair. New proposals call for taxes on capital gains from the sale of securities, the elimination of tax privileges for doctors, the cutting of provisions that allow some people to estimate their income, and taxation of farmland.

<DATELINE>OUKASIE, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government accustomed to getting its way has met its match in this ramshackle black township, which officially does n't exist. For years, white authorities have been trying to coax or coerce the people of <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> into moving to a newer township 12 miles away. Officials legally abolished <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> in 1986, but about 8,000 residents remain and are determined to stay. In April, the government declared the 55-year-old township an `` emergency camp'' subject to severe new regulations. Rents were raised by 50 percent, unauthorized visitors will be barred as of June 1, and permits are required to renovate homes, keep pets or take in lodgers. Members of the community believe the government seeks to demoralize them so they will give up and move. That would enable the authorities to eliminate <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> without resorting to forced removal, a policy the government claims to have abandoned. <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> residents say they wo n't give in to the pressure. `` Sometimes in life you get tired of being harassed and moved about,'' said <PERSON> Sello </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramakobye </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON>'s civic association. `` You decide it's time to resist.'' The official reason for <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON>'s intended demise is that the government considers it an unhealthy slum, beyond rehabilitation because of `` astronomic costs.'' Residents commissioned a study of their own that found upgrading would cost 3 million rands -LRB- $ 1.4 million -RRB-. They say this would be cheaper than relocating all of them at the new township, <LOCATION> Lethlabile </LOCATION>, and they believe the government's real reason for wanting <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> shut down is that it is just a few hundreds yards from Brits, a white suburb 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s capital. Brits is a stronghold of the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Its white residents have displayed little sympathy for their black neighbors, who are able to walk to their jobs in Brits but would have to pay for transport if they moved to <LOCATION> Lethlabile </LOCATION>. Because of government funding, <PERSON> Lethlabile </PERSON> has advantages over <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON>, and some of the 5,000 former <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> residents who have moved there are pleased with their choice. The new township's streets are smooth, its homes have electricity and plumbing A few houses are relatively lavish, with patios and two-car garages. <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> is overcrowded and dilapidated. Many homes are in ruins, demolished by former owners as a prerequisite for getting state compensation to move to <LOCATION> Lethlabile </LOCATION>. The only services provided are water from communal taps and removal of waste from bucket toilets. But <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> has certain charms. Trees, a rare sight in many townships, are abundant, and well-tended gardens adjoin even some of the sorriest-looking metal shacks. Two soccer fields are maintained diligently by local youths. `` Everything we want to do, we do it ourselves,'' said <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Sithole </PERSON>, a 39-year-old former carpenter. He is one of an estimated 50 percent of the adult population that is unemployed, and says job-seeking from <LOCATION> Lethlabile </LOCATION> would be costly and difficult. Other jobless residents do n't want to move because they have improved their homes in <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> over the years and ca n't afford houses in <LOCATION> Lethlabile </LOCATION>, except for the small metal huts allocated to newcomers. `` The social structure in <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> is so coherent,'' said <PERSON> Ramakobye </PERSON>. `` It's wrong to destroy it. In <LOCATION> Lethlabile </LOCATION>, everybody is for himself.'' <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> residents also are wary of <PERSON> Lethlabile </PERSON>'s proximity to the nominally independent black homeland of <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>. They fear the new township will be incorporated into the homeland, thus depriving residents of South African citizenship. `` No one is going to volunteer to go to <LOCATION> Lethlabile </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Sithole </PERSON>. `` The government thinks everybody is going to be scared into going, but it will take force. You should see the unity of these people.'' <PERSON> Sithole </PERSON> guided visitors to the edge of the nearby white suburb, where a concrete moat filled with dark green muck separates handsome, new hillside homes from a dirt road leading to <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON>. `` How can they say it's too expensive to upgrade <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> when they upgrade their mountain?'' he said. Raw sewage from whites' homes runs into a gully next to the township. <PERSON> Sithole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> residents are somewhat cynical about white complaints that the black community smells.

<HEAD>Methodists Blast Israel In Conflict With Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the months of Israeli-Palestinian violence, various church organizations have criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as moving too harshly to curb disorder. Last week such criticism got tougher. In one of the severest condemnations yet of Israeli conduct, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> said, `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s current iron-fist policy ... is totally unacceptable as civilized behavior.'' The blast from this church of nearly 10 million Americans, second-largest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Protestantism next to <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION>, came in a late-night finale of its governing conference and got scant news attention. Yet it marked a heightened level of church reproach against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, putting added strains on Jewish-Christian relationships in this country. Rabbi <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON>, interreligious affairs director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called the statement a one-sided expression of `` selective outrage'' against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> without also criticizing <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> fomenters of violence. `` Overall it's an unbalanced statement,'' he said, and the `` harshest emanated from the church world toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' However, it was approved by an overwhelming 816-76 vote, urging the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stop all military and security aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> until `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ceases the repression of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in the occupied territory.'' Castigating <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s use of force to put down rock-heaving Palestinian upheavals, the resolution said of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s actions: `` This violent behavior brutalizes human beings, both oppressed and oppressors, and leads to a deepening cycle of hatred and violence.'' The statement called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` to stop beatings, to end the killings, to cease destroying Palestinian homes, to stop deporting Palestinians, to enter into negotiations with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> civilians and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> over legitimate demands, including fair and just distribution of disputed lands.'' Oddly, a few days before, the church's bishops had issued an even-handed statement on the <LOCATION> Israel-Palestinian </LOCATION> crisis, seeing in it impetus for fresh approaches, urging <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a plebiscite among Palestinians on their desires. However, the church delegates, half laity and half clergy from around the country, asked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to press international efforts and open negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to settle the region's problems. <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON>, a familiar figure in Christian-Jewish discussions, said the demand that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cut off aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> until it shifts policies was a `` carrot and stick technique that good friends do n't use and that won ` t work. `` There was no similar call for us to stop miliitary and security aid to Arab countries that harbor and train terrorists. It calls on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to do various things, but does n't call on Arab countries to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' In various ways, <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON> said the statement applied a `` selective double standard'' of blaming only <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He said the statement `` does not mention what the Palestinians are doing. To read it, you would come to the conclusion that they are Mahatma Gandhi-like non-violent people, when we all know they are not.'' However, the statement does ask Palestinians and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and `` to cease the support or initiation of all terrorist activities.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, executive of a newly organized <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interreligious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, told the conference earlier: `` It is a conflict that is not reducible to all the right on one side and all the wrong on the other.'' However, he said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> leaders usually are reluctant to talk about it for fear of being labeled anti-Jewish. That inhibition did n't prevail among the Methodist representatives.

<HEAD>Joseph Campbell's Mythology Featured on PBS</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> made his career teaching about life, as comprehended in the myths or stories people tell about themselves and the universe. Half a year after his death, public television offers a stimulating seminar with the great teacher starting May 16 with `` The Hero's Journey,'' a one-hour documentary about <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>. A week later, <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> begins a six-week series of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>' conversations with <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and the Power of Myth. `` The Hero's Journey'' is a useful introduction to <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s ideas about mythology and his core conviction: `` There is one mythology in the world,'' with variations called Christianity, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, Buddhism and so on A myth, in this sense, is not a lie, but a metaphor for the experience of life. So, to <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, the idea of God is not true or false. `` God is a metaphor for a mystery that absolutely transcends all human categories of thought, even the categories of being and non-being.'' The metaphor is valid, he says, if `` it is putting you in touch with the mystery that is the ground of your own being. If it is n't, it's a lie.'' Though `` <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and the Power of Myth'' is simply the two men talking, it may be the most compelling television series this year. The conversation is strewn with ideas that will be enlightening, provocative and at times maddening. The success of the series may be measured by the number of times a viewer will want to argue, and by the conversations that begin after the TV is switched off. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, who taught at <ORGANIZATION> Sarah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> for 38 years, died Oct. 30 in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> at age 83. He left an extensive record of his work in books, including `` The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' and `` The Masks of God.'' `` He is a writer of important scholarship, but you do n't find the person in the writing,'' <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` You find the mind there, but not the personality, not the power of the individual that comes through any great teacher. That's why I wanted to do so much with him. We would have his works, but we would n't have his teaching. Teachers have to be experienced, they ca n't be read.'' <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> did n't know much about <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> when they met in 1979 for an interview that appeared two years later on `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>' Journal'' on PBS `` We had over 14,000 requests for a transcript, so I knew I had touched a chord,'' <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> said. `` Even without the requests, I knew he had touched a chord because he moved me. He opened my eyes. He connected what had been unrelated phenomena in my own experience in life.'' For this series, <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> taped 23 hours of interviews and spent many more hours in informal conversations. `` We became pretty good friends, more so than I usually do with somebody I put on the air because I do n't have that much time with them,'' <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> said. `` I was his perpetual student, his graduate student for life.'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> was raised as a Roman Catholic and fondly recalled that experience as `` powerful, life-supporting and beautiful.'' But, like many another believer, his faith was derailed by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON>. `` The thing that saved me,'' he says, `` was the <ORGANIZATION> Upanishads </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>.'' In those texts, he says in `` The Hero's Journey,'' he found the same mythology as in <ORGANIZATION> Christianity </ORGANIZATION>, without the insistence that the stories were historically true. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> `` is the most spiritual man I ever met,'' <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> said, but he knows that this series will not be welcomed by fundamentalists. `` What I took him as saying is that all religion is true, and if it works for you, fine,'' said <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>. `` If it does in fact lead you to love the lord thy god with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself, fine. You do n't have to move on to this other angle of seeing ... `` Faith,'' <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> added, `` is an excruciatingly personal choice or rejection. Your idea of God may be terribly dissatisfying to me, which is why I love the democratic way which is that you ca n't impose it on me. <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>' interviews with <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> are also the basis for a book, `` The Power of Myth,'' compiled by <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Flowers </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. It will be published this month by <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> said the book was initiated by <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, an editor at Doubleday. <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> had been impressed by the earlier interviews in which <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> talked about the mythic significance of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s funeral and of the `` ancient mythological symbol, the widow who helps us all come to terms with our grief when the ruler is killed.''

<TEXT>
 A month after the 60th Academy Awards, evidence persists that the Oscar's golden touch does n't always live up to its reputation. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> had hoped that the sweep of nine Oscars by `` The Last Emperor'' would result in a box-office bonanza. But despite doubling the number of theaters to more than 800 after the awards, the Chinese epic has added only $ 10 million to theater grosses. After 164 days in release, `` The Last Emperor'' had sold $ 36.6 million worth of tickets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. By comparison, the ghostly comedy `` ` Beetlejuice'' grossed $ 46.7 million in just 33 days. Still, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic distribution, maintains `` The Last Emperor'' has had a very good performance since the awards. `` Comparing ` The Last Emperor' to ` Beetlejuice' is like comparing apples to oranges,'' he said. `` ` The Last Emperor' will never have the teen-age audience that ` Beetlejuice' has.'' <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON> predicted the <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> film will continue doing good business through Memorial Day and will remain in distribution for a long time. `` Moonstruck,'' which collected acting awards for <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, has added $ 10 million since the Oscars, bringing its total to $ 69 million. The figure is impressive, since the film had been in wide release for more than two months. Much has been written about how winning Oscars can inflate actors' salaries. With one exception, this year's winners seem unlikely to boost their paychecks. Since `` Romancing the Stone'' and `` Fatal Attraction,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> has become one of the most in-demand stars in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. His win for `` Wall Street'' will have little effect on <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who sometimes produces his own films -LRB- `` The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Syndrome,'' `` Jewel of the Nile'' -RRB-. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' next film is for <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, who produced `` Fatal Attraction.'' In `` Black Rain,'' he will play an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> police officer trying to solve a murder by the Yakusa, the Japanese Mafia. Having appeared in `` The Witches of Eastwick,'' `` Suspect'' and `` Moonstruck'' in 1987, <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> can afford a rest. No new films have been announced for her in the wake of the Oscar, but the scripts must be piling up at her door. Meanwhile, she will collect a fortune with her Las Vegas act. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, winner as supporting actor in `` The Untouchables,'' needs no help from Oscar or anyone else in his career. He has been a top wage earner since his <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> days. He'll appear this summer in `` Presidio'' with <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, and works next as <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s father in the third `` Indiana Jones'' movie. <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seems to be the major recipient of Oscar's beneficence Although a distinguished stage actress, she was little known before `` Moonstruck.'' Since her nomination, she has been able to decline two offers for television series. She has accepted a small role in <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>' `` Working Girls,'' which stars <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, but her agents predict big things for her. The April 11 Oscar show drew generally poor notices but also the best television rating in years. `` The ratings show that we did n't lose our audience, even during a sweep -LRB- by ` The Last Emperor' -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> who produced the show for the Academy. `` I tried to prevent that by putting a heavy load of comedy -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Robin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> -RRB- toward the end. The audience stayed with us.'' <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> recognized the problems in moving to the Shrine Auditorium with its poor acoustics, and the horendous traffic jam. `` But those problems can be solved. I think we benefited from having 6,000 in the theater; it was a much warmer audience.'' The Music Center, where the awards show previously was staged, held only 2,000 people. Most critics lambasted the 3 -LCB- - hour broadcast time, and <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> commented that the Academy will have to address that problem `` There are certain things in the show that the Academy is interested in but the public is n't,'' he said. Efforts to eliminate such awards as short subjects, documentaries and animation from the show have so far failed to achieve Board of Governors approval. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> be around next year to help deal with such problems? `` Not on your life,'' he said. `` Two years is enough.''

<HEAD>Scripture Lashes Astrology, But It May Be Different Now, Or Dumb</HEAD>
<BYLINE>GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Astrology and other strategies presumed to predict the future are sharply denounced in the Bible, but the ancient star-gazing system has evolved somewhat over the centuries. In its modern popular form, which reportedly has been used by <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, it has little to do with religion, but scholars say it still has ramifications that can turn it at odds with biblical faith. `` A lot of people today regard it as kind of an innocent pastime,'' says the Rev. Page <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, an Old Testament scholar of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> `` They do n't put much store in it. I put it in the same category as reading fortune cookies in a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant. But if people really take it seriously as a scheme for ordering their lives, the old objections become valid again.'' To rely on it seriously, he added, `` borders more on stupidity than sin.'' In olden times, astrology was closely connected with idolatry, used along with other devices both to determine courses of action and ascertain the will of the gods. `` An abomination,'' Scripture calls it in Deutertonomy 18:9, decreeing death by stoning for any Israelite, man or woman, who `` practices divination'' or uses soothsaying, augury, sorcery, a charmer, medium, wizard or necromancer. Divination, linked to early astrology, used various clues to determine the will of the gods, such as positions of celestial bodies, tossed arrows to see how they fell, examining configurations of oil on water or in a sheep's liver. The prophet <PERSON> Isaiah </PERSON>, assailing the evils of Babylon, says scornfully: `` Let your astrologers come forward, those stargazers who make predictions month by month, let them save you from what is coming upon you. Surely they are like stubble. The fire will burn them up.'' Similar reproaches are scattered through Scripture, with astrologers described as those `` who divide the heavens -LRB- into 12 signs of the zodiac -RRB-, who gaze at the stars, who at the new moons predict what shall befall ... `` They wander about each in his own direction.'' Rabbi <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sperling </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College-Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> said the strong condemnations of divination -LRB- early astrology -RRB- were because of its ties to idolatry, contrary to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>. `` We had the prophets and got the word of the Lord directly from them,'' he said. `` We did n't have to rely on looking up at the stars or inside animals to see what the gods had in store for us. The prophets were much more reliable. `` What the Bible condemns is considering the stars as kind of heavenly writing, telling you what <PERSON> God </PERSON> has in store for you.'' He said astrology had evolved since ancient Bible times, modified in later ancient Greek and Egyptian civilizations to be seen not as revealing the gods, but charting planetary effects on earthly behavior and moods. `` That's not quite what the Bible was dealing with,'' <PERSON> Sperling </PERSON> said. Added Rabbi <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Borowitz </PERSON>, also of <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College-Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION>: `` There's not a simple straight line from the Bible to the kind of astrology Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is involved in.'' However, religious scholars said astrology, claiming the planets partly control human affairs, tends to run counter to biblical teaching of humanity's free will to choose good or evil. However, religious institutions rarely speak of astrology these days, although it was often attacked in the early centuries of Christianity and also in <LOCATION> Islam </LOCATION>. `` Fundamentalist theology very clearly condemns astrology,'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said, but he noted that contemporary churches generally have shown little, if any, concern with it. He said the assumption seems to be that few people take it seriously. `` If they do, that's another matter, and something to be concerned about,'' he said. <PERSON> Sperling </PERSON> said that Jewish Scritpures -LRB- the Old Testament -RRB- strongly condemn early tendencies of astrology -LRB- as a conduit of gods -RRB-, but rabbinical thought since then has varied on the subject. `` We're not of one mind,'' he said. `` Some are opposed to it, while others think it's not such a terrible thing.'' The prophet <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, who served in the court of the Babylonian king <PERSON> Nebuchadnezzar </PERSON>, bewildered by his fortune-tellers and astrologers, told him: `` No wise men, enchanters, magicians or astrologers can show to the king the mystery which the king has asked, but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries ...'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> proceeded to tell <PERSON> Nebuchadnezzar </PERSON> his reign was ended. `` You have been weighed in the balances and found wanting.'' Legend has it that the wise men who visited the Christ child were Persian astrologers alerted to the event by planetary conjunctions. Called variously a pre-science or pseudo-science, astrology became `` scientifically untenable'' with the rise of modern physics, says the Encyclopedia Britannica. But it still holds wide attention in newspaper columns, other publications and commercial establishments. The encyclopedia says: `` In short, modern Western astrology, though of great interest sociologically and popularly, generally is regarded as devoid of intellectual value.''

<HEAD>War Forces Iraq to Streamline its Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s economy lost its footing in the 1986 oil price collapse but is regaining its balance, partly because of the 7 -LCB- - year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> The conflict, which is costing $ 10 billion a year, has forced President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> to streamline a bloated prewar bureaucracy, increase efficiency in government sectors and scrap some of his socialist programs. Oil prices are firmer and oil exports are climbing. <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> has sold off inefficient state-owned enterprises in a program aimed at revitalizing the private sector, long suppressed by socialist policies. All this has helped ease the worries of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s many creditors, who last year had to reschedule the country's debt repayments because the Iraqis did not have enough cash. Even so, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is only just managing to keep pace with a war-incurred foreign debt of at least $ 35 billion, diplomats say. The government's decision last year to loosen its grip on subsidized prices and foreign exchange has helped reduce once-chronic shortages but at a painful cost for many of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 15 million people. The long lines of shoppers outside stores are fewer now than in 1986 because goods are more plentiful. Some Iraqis grumble about prices, however. Local meat, which used to cost the equivalent of $ 7.50 to $ 9 a pound, now sells for $ 9 to $ 10.50 a pound, at the dollar's official rate of exchange against the dinar of $ 3.30 to one. Exchange houses outside <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, however, trade the dinar at 50 cents for one. Bread, rice and cooking oil remain subsidized. But a package of 30 eggs that once cost $ 4.30, now sells for at least $ 8.30. Even the cost of candy bars has risen, from 25 cents to nearly $ 1. These are stiff prices for many workers. Civil servants, for example, earn 90 to 150 dinars a month. Many Iraqis have found their incomes squeezed further this year by increased working hours in essential industries and offices, making the once-common practice of moonlighting nearly impossible. It's still difficult to find many goods at subsidized prices, forcing Iraqis into the costly black market for such things as car parts or cigarettes. The variety on the vegetable stands is the most visible sign of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s move away from 20 years of strict socialist controls on the economy. The government told businessmen last year they could import goods with foreign currency, with few questions asked about how they got the money. Planning Minister <PERSON> Samal </PERSON> <PERSON> Majeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Faraj </PERSON> said recently <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will allow Arabs from other countries to invest in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> with guarantees against government seizure of their assets. In the last year, the government has sold off bus companies, poultry farms, dairies, gas stations and supermarkets and other businesses and is trying to get outside investors to buy a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, the national flag carrier. <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> also abolished labor laws that had guaranteed employment. Other countries are looking at <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> with more confidence. It has won promises of new loans or credit guarantees from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Until the war, it did n't matter if the economy was well run or not because they had so much money,'' said a European diplomat. `` This is a country with more than 100 billion barrels of proven oil reserves,'' the diplomat noted. `` They plainly have a way to repay.''

<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fourteen-year-old <PERSON> Noorieh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazloumpoor </PERSON> has had two educations in her young life _ one Moslem, the other Marxist. She got her Marxist education in her homeland, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. As a refugee with her family in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for the past two years, her education has been based on Islam, her religion. She is typical of Afghan children who have been taught two conflicting ideologies over the past decade of war in their country. Now with the Soviet military withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the children who have had an Islamic education in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will be returning home to join those whose education was wholly Marxist. The gap may be wide, but students interviewed here were confident it wo n't deter them from reuniting their country in the long run. <PERSON> Noorieh </PERSON> went to school in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s capital, until she was 12. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, she enrolled in a Moslem school run by the guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan government. Like many of her classmates, she has had to switch from courses that taught Communist doctrine to interpretations of the Koran, the Moslem holy book. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, she said, she was taught that it was her `` duty to serve the country, the masses, the revolution and the fruits of history.'' At her refugee school in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, the blue cover of her Persian language text book has a map identifying her country as `` Moslem Afghanistan.'' Another map in the book carries the Koranic verse, `` There is no god but Allah. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> is his prophet.'' Refugee books published by the guerrillas' Afghan education council also teach: `` The future of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> should be reconstructed on the principles of Islamic culture.'' `` Eventually we will have to reconcile the two,'' said <PERSON> Ehsanollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Poopal </PERSON>, 17-year-old 10th grader. `` It's going to take a lot of effort, patience. They have their reasons and we have ours.'' <PERSON> Poopal </PERSON>, however, said he will not accept the Communist teachings and will try to explain to his classmates back home why his beliefs are different. Another refugee student, 15-year-old <PERSON> Mehrafsa </PERSON>, said he thinks it is going to be difficult in the beginning. `` We are going to suffer first, especially to see our friends are led toward a corrupt path, taught bad values. But I do n't think it will be too long before we understand each other. I do n't think the gap will affect the country in the long run.'' <PERSON> Wassimeh </PERSON>, 24, a teacher at one of the refugee schools, believes Moslem education will continue when the children among the 3 million refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> return home. <PERSON> Maliheh </PERSON> <PERSON> Malekzad </PERSON>, 28, an mathematics teacher, said she taught at a <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> school until two years ago. She added that unless a teacher was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, there was no hope of promotion. `` It is very difficult for a Moslem not to be able to express her religious viewpoint and to be taunted for her belief,'' she said. Schools in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, according to the teachers and students here, have their own party recruitment bodies _ the scouts, the first stage of Communist `` indoctrination,'' and the youth organization, where Russian culture and language are taught, and where some are given schoolarships to study in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The third stage is the older youth organization where advanced Communist books are read outside the school curriculum. Ms. <PERSON> Malekzad </PERSON> said the refugee schools here are good at teaching theories but poor in practical education. The walls and classrooms are adorned with guerrilla posters, and during class, the students sing: `` I cry for my motherland, I cry for its martyr. Wherever I turn, I see broken limbs.'' But 9-year-old <PERSON> Godsiyeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> said she likes studying Islam because it will `` make me go to heaven.''

<TEXT>
 Rambo, <ORGANIZATION> Crocodile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> and a dwarf named Willow begin the summer movie season this month with a blast that industry analysts expect to help propel the nation's theaters to a record year. `` It looks like another record,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, financial writer for the entertainment trade paper <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION>. `` The first four months are already $ 100 million more than last year's record. If the pace is continued at the same rate, the year will easily exceed 1987's $ 4 \ billion `` The 15 weeks of summer, which amount to 40 percent of the year's total, look very promising. First sequels of big hits are always strong, and you've got ` Crocodile Dundee II,' plus ` Rambo III,' which is really a first sequel since the original film was ` First Blood.' Plus you have a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> film which is not in the same ` Star Wars' mold.'' `` Crocodile Dundee II'' and `` Rambo III'' open on May 27, while the <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> epic, `` Willow,'' was moved ahead to May 20 in an apparent attempt by <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> to beat the crowd. The company is understandably nervous about the $ 35 million film _ plus $ 20 million for advertising and promotion _ which has no stars, and the hero is a dwarf who protects a baby from an evil queen. `` Rambo III'' also seems a perilous investment in view of its reported $ 63 million cost, including $ 20 million to <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>. Also, <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s last two releases failed to ignite the box ofice.

<HEAD>Nile River Running Dry Bringing Threat of Egyptian Power Shortage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> built the <LOCATION> Aswan </LOCATION> High Dam two decades ago as a safeguard against the whims of the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. But the worst drought in 70 years has dangerously lowered water levels and threatens to shut down the dam's electric-power generators. The government is using television jingles and newspaper campaigns to urge Egyptians to conserve water and electricity. President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> warned on television that thousands of villages could go dark this summer unless the eight-year-long drought upriver eases. He said the water of <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Aswan </LOCATION> dam's 1,335-square-mile reservoir, is perilously close to a level impossible to sustain electricity generation The dam, built during the 1960s with Soviet help and inaugurated in 1971, was intended mainly to end annual killer floods. It also was to provide adequate Nile water to irrigate <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s agricultural heartland along its banks. In addition, it supplies 30 percent of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s electricity. Experts say agricultural production has escaped serious harm so far but could be affected by another year of drought. Agriculture was the main casualty from the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>'s last serious drought, which began in 1913 and continued for seven years. In the current drought, the high dam has been credited with sparing <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> the famine that has spread across <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> upriver. But the prolonged lack of rainfall at the Ugandan and Ethiopian headwaters of the White Nile and <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION> has lowered the river's level in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> by more than 69 feet at the high dam. The water surface is now 508 feet above sea level. Summer rains in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> normally provide the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> with 84 percent of its water. This past January, the month when the river is always at its shallowest, houseboats were high and dry in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, 600 miles downstream from <LOCATION> Aswan </LOCATION>, for the first time in anyone's memory. Nile cruises from <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION>, 450 miles south of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Simbel </PERSON> were abandoned or started upstream from <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION>. Trans-Nile ferry service was halted at <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION> for a while last year, and long-time residents reported more land outcroppings in the Nile's dark, murky water than ever before. <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> <PERSON> Abaza </PERSON>, the minister of electricity and energy, sounded the alarm almost a year ago, cautioning against increased consumption and waste of electricity and water. Consumption continued to climb, however, and official figures indicate that at least 45 percent of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s share of the Nile waters is wasted by negligence and the city's outmoded water system. Current predictions hold that the water level at the dam will decrease to 495 feet above sea level by July, <PERSON> Abaza </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` That will mean that the dam will be able to work only at half capacity, producing 900 megawatts,'' <PERSON> Abaza </PERSON> said. `` If the level goes under 147 meters -LRB- 485 feet -RRB-, ... production of the high dam will be zero.'' He added that generating plants are producing electricity as fast as they can now just to keep up with an ever-increasing demand. Much of the increase in demand has been in the countryside, where peasants returning from well-paying jobs in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> oil regions have come home with electric fans, ovens and television sets. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said in his TV address that if high-dam generation stops, the government will have to keep factories working by cutting off power to some of the country's 5,000 villages. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s 54 million people use 45 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, increasing by up to 20 percent a year. Figures indicate that the steady increase is due to what Egyptians regard as luxury items, such as air conditioners and color television sets. `` Egyptians open their taps and find water, and switch on the light and everything lights up, and they think that it is easy and will remain that way,'' said <PERSON> Abaza </PERSON>. `` But they have to start cooperating and curbing their consumption or there are going to be serious consequences.''

<HEAD>200,000 Volunteer To Watch Presidential Balloting in Chile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With a little financial help from abroad and a lot of enthusiasm from 200,000 volunteers, opponents of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military government have launched a campaign they say will keep fraud out of this year's presidential election. Ten opposition parties, from left to right, have united in the campaign of door-to-door voter education, poll-watching on election day and independent vote counting afterward. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> maintain that the system is necessary because they believe fraud tipped a 1980 plebiscite to approve a government-drafted constitution. <PERSON> Genaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Arriagada </PERSON>, secretary general of the command, said the 1980 plebiscite, in which the government received 67 percent of the vote, `` lacked the minimal conditions necessary to guarantee any honest election.'' That vote took place without voter registries, because the old ones had been destroyed by the military shortly after they seized power in 1973. Polling stations were manned only by government-appointed officials, without any opposition or independent supervision. <PERSON> Arriagada </PERSON> said a national census taken two years after the vote showed that in several cities the number of people who voted in the plebiscite was higher than the number of residents in the cities. The government has denied accusations of fraud. `` The upcoming presidential plebiscite will be very different,'' <PERSON> Arriagada </PERSON> said. He said voter registries now have reopened, `` and this time we have the capacity to guarantee a clean vote.'' In the plebiscite scheduled for an unspecified date later this year, Chileans will be able to vote `` yes'' or `` no'' on a single, military-appointed candidate for the 1989-97 presidential term. If the candidate is rejected by voters, a competitive election will take place a year later. President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the 73-year-old army commander who has ruled since 1973, is considered the most likely candidate. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a key member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said 700 specialists are training the 200,000 volunteers throughout the country to work as poll-watchers on election day. He added in an interview that the opposition will be able to have three to five monitors at each of the 20,000 or so voting places. `` We can guarantee to every citizen that his vote will be properly accounted for, and that it will remain secret,'' <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> said. Some volunteers have already visited hundreds of thousands of voters in the door-to-door campaign to `` explain to them that this time the vote will be totally clean,'' he said. <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> added that part of the financing for the campaign has come `` from groups abroad interested in the restoration of democracy in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' He said the cost is relatively low, however. He estimated his <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will spend the equivalent of around $ 100,000. <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> did no identify the foreign groups sending money, but the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> and several West European foundations, especially in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, have been officially reported in the past as granting financial aid to Chilean democratic dissident groups. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> also has organized a nationwide computerized vote-counting system to operate independently of the government system. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arriagada </PERSON>, an engineer in charge of the Vote Counting Center said `` we will be able to quickly deliver a projection of the vote and complete returns.'' <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Campana </PERSON>, a leading electoral expert of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest in the opposition, said, `` The system we are implementing fully guarantees a clean vote. There will be no fraud this time. Chileans can rest assured of that.'' <PERSON> Campana </PERSON> said volunteers trained as poll-monitors show `` an enormous enthusiasm.'' `` Many of them are paying for their travel and other expenses connected with the campaign out of their own pockets.'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdes </PERSON>, who works at the Vote Counting Center, said, however, old legislation granting the government emergency powers could still be invoked. `` That legislation, for example, would allow the government to prevent us from announcing the returns we will be gathering,'' <PERSON> Valdes </PERSON> said. That, said <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>, is `` the only fraud possibility that remains open.''

 Thirty-five years after security officers first noticed that the Soviets were bombarding the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with microwave radiation, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government still has not determined conclusively _ or is unwilling to reveal _ the purpose behind the beams. Among the possible reasons put forward by experts: attempts by the Soviets to trigger eavesdropping devices, to interfere with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence-gathering operations or to affect the health, minds or behavior of Americans working in the embassy. Low-power microwave signals `` continue to be detected'' at the embassy, according to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diplomatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>. However, the department has ceased special efforts to monitor the health of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel exposed to the mysterious Soviet beams. Over the years, several studies to investigate potential effects of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> radiation led to controversial results. In some cases, the projects were terminated over the objections of researchers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made a series of diplomatic protests to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> over the microwave situation, beginning at least as early as the <LOCATION> Glassboro </LOCATION> summit in June 1967. The Associated Press examined 5,000 pages of declassified documents from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> under the Freedom of Information Act and interviewed dozens of current and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, scientific researchers, medical specialists and attorneys. Many questions remain about the microwave bombardment, which has involved a variety of transmitter sites, frequency ranges, modulations and power levels over a time span stretching from just after Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s death in 1953 to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s current reform drive. Nonetheless, these key facts emerge: _ The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> microwaves affair has had broader implications in several areas, including U.S.-Soviet political relations, research into the biological effects of non-ionizing radiation, electronic intelligence-gathering operations and employee-management relations at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government apparently has succeeded in fighting back lawsuits and administrative claims totalling about $ 250 million brought by employees who were exposed to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> radiation or their dependents _ Some American scientists and medical specialists investigating the problem have been seriously concerned about a possible Soviet bloc lead in research on the use of radio-frequency and microwave radiation for `` mind control'' and other weapons applications _ Significant questions remain over the validity of an epidemiological study of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy personnel carried out in 1976-78 by <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> under contract to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> The study found no adverse health effects among embassy workers. _ Shielding of the embassy against the Soviet beams was first recommended 11 years before protective screening was finally installed _ Certain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apparently were exposed to significant amounts of electromagnetic radiation from sources within the embassy, posing the risk of possible `` synergistic'' effects from combined exposure to such radiation and the Soviet microwaves Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with a frequency range from 300 megahertz -LRB- 300 million cycles per second -RRB- up to 300 gigahertz -LRB- 300 billion cycles per second -RRB-. The main uses of microwaves are in radar, UHF -LRB- ultra-high frequency -RRB- television, long-distance telephone links, satellite communications, cooking, medical treatment and a variety of industrial processes. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diplomatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> said in a recent statement that `` microwave signals ... continue to be detected at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy chancery.'' It said the Soviet signals cover a broad frequency range, from 5 to 11 gigahertz; are `` usually on for a couple of hours a day'' and typically have a power level of 0.1 microwatt per square centimeter outside the building. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said: `` We are, of course, concerned about this situation. In the past, we've protested when -LRB- microwave power -RRB- levels have exceeded those we consider safe. We're prepared to do so again, should we determine that they pose any threat whatsoever to our staff, however remote.'' The declassified documents disclose that the bombardment of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy drew expressions of serious concern in the mid-1970s from two <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> directors _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. They also reveal that this concern came years after experts had initially recommended installing shielding to protect Americans working inside the embassy from the radiation being beamed by the Soviets. Eleven years passed between when scientific advisers proposed shielding of the embassy and when the protective screening actually was installed. In an April 3, 1965 memorandum, a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> scientific consultant, whose name was deleted from the document, called for `` selection of suitable copper screening and mandatory coverage of all window openings'' at the 10-story embassy. Installation of aluminum screening was finally started on Feb. 6, 1976 _ at the same time that special briefings were held to inform embassy personnel about the microwave radiation, which until then had been kept secret from all except a handful of senior officials. Ten days later, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s concern over the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> problem was reflected in a `` Dear Larry'' letter from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, deputy undersecretary of state for management. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote that while he had been told by a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> expert that data from biomedical research were insufficient to prove that the Soviet beams posed a health hazard, `` the clinical evidence pertaining to several embassy staff members, recently obtained by the State -LRB- Department -RRB- Medical Services, makes it prudent in our judgment to consider MUTS signal emanations as potentially hazardous.'' `` MUTS'' was the code name for the Soviet beams. <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>'s expression of concern, in a Nov. 26, 1975 letter to <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, came five weeks after the Soviets put into operation a second microwave transmitter _ code-named MUTS-2 _ atop a building just south of the embassy. This was in addition to a microwave beam _ known as MUTS or MUTS-1 _ aimed at the chancery from the roof of an apartment building east of the embassy, across Tchaikovsky Street. <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> wrote that `` the increased probability of health injuries to personnel at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> ... -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> deletion -RRB- ... warrant our immediate attention.'' `` I have been briefed on the implication that the MUTS and MUTS-2 signals are a possible cause of recent serious health problems of the embassy,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> chief said. <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> told <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> that <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> specialist on biological and health effects of non-ionizing radiation, would be available to assist the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in evaluating microwave radiation levels in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> already had spent a week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in July 1975 working with <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> security officers. He returned to the Soviet capital for a 16-day visit in December 1975 to re-analyze the situation in the wake of MUTS-2 going into operation. Three days after <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> memorandum summmarized <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>' initial observations: `` The <ORGANIZATION> CW </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- continuous wave -RRB- signals which were active during October and then again since 30 November are a cause for increased concern, because the power density of the emanations is often concentrated within one or several narrow bandwidths at frequencies that can produce undesirable biological effects.'' `` Perhaps the most distressing observation is that the signal composition and orientation continue to change, and that the general trend of such change since July would appear to be in the direction of an increased health risk,'' it said.

 The memorandum added: `` Since some recent health problems among embassy staff appear similar to EMP -LRB- electromagnetic pulse -RRB- researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, at <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, and possibly at the Naval Special Weapons Center, comparison of details of exposure and later-occurring pathologies appears warranted.'' Health problems which have been reported among personnel working with electromagnetic pulse equipment include an unusually high incidence of brain tumors and liver diseases. A memorandum prepared by <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> following his 1975 visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said, `` Dr. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> consulting physician, has found that several members of the embassy display symptoms that are non-specific but have been reported frequently in patients chronically exposed to non-ionizing radiation.'' Such symptoms include headaches, inability to concentrate and fatigue, as well as physiological effects including shifts in the ratios of various blood cells. Soviet intentions remain the foremost unanswered question surrounding irradiation of the embassy. Attempts to figure out the purposes behind the microwave beams have involved specialists at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The difficulties posed by this task were reflected in a June 6, 1975 letter in which the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> told <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> at State: `` We hope that by working together State and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> technical officers can come up with satisfactory answers to this perennial enigma.'' Three theories have been put forward as possible explanations: _ The Soviets were trying to interfere with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronic intelligence-gathering operations; _ The microwaves were used to interact with Soviet eavesdropping devices planted within the embassy; _ Or the Soviets were trying to induce psychological, behavioral or physiological effects among <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>, who served as head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Soviet desk and then as the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy's No 2 official before retiring in 1980, said in an interview, `` We never did really figure out to my satisfaction what the purpose of the microwaves was. I've got hunches about it, but there was no final, formal finding that was passed down from the technicians.'' `` It's extremely difficult for people running the political side of the -LRB- U.S.-Soviet -RRB- relationship and the management side to get a good handle on high-tech electronic stuff,'' said <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>, now director of <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for Foreign Policy. Garrison leans toward the electronic jamming theory. However, that explanation has been challenged by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> veterans familiar with the military-run electronic intelligence-gathering operations. Retired Army Brig. Gen. R.E. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> said he `` absolutely can not accept'' the jamming hypothesis because when he was in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during the mid-1960s the microwaves `` had no effect whatsoever on our activities.'' <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Koslov </PERSON>, a non-ionizing radiation specialist who has helped investigate the radiation, believes the beams probably were been intended to interact with Soviet listening devices. `` They -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debugging specialists -RRB- still have n't satisfied themselves that they've found all the devices that may have been interacting with that signal. They may have found some of them, but they certainly have n't found all of them,'' said <PERSON> Koslov </PERSON>, a biophysicist at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in Laurel, Md. He added, however, that `` there could have been different purposes at different times'' over the 35-year history of the microwaves problem. Regarding possible anti-personnel uses of microwave radiation, <PERSON> Koslov </PERSON> said, `` I would n't say that it is impossible to produce psychological effects, but you would have to do it with very different kinds of signals, much higher power than what you have there.'' Other American specialists involved in the investigations have raised the `` mind control'' and weaponry possibilities. Among them was <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesaro </PERSON>, who in the mid-1960s was serving as deputy director for advanced sensors at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Cesaro </PERSON> helped run the classified <ORGANIZATION> Pandora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, in which monkeys were exposed to a `` synthetic <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> signal'' in a laboratory at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. Initially, <PERSON> Pandora </PERSON> researchers believed that the irradiation had caused subtle behavioral effects in the test animals. By mid-1969 consideration was being given to expanding the project to include human subjects. Later, however, re-analysis of the experimental data raised doubts about its validity. A scientific review panel decided in 1970 that the project should be disbanded. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Cesaro </PERSON>, in an interview prior to his death two years ago, contended that `` in our experiments we did some remarkable things. And there was no question in my mind that you can get into the brain with microwaves.'' Arguing that the Soviet bloc's investment of funds, personnel and laboratory facilities in research on non-ionizing radiation bioeffects has far outstripped the West's, he said, `` I look at it as still a major, serious, unsettled threat to the security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` If you really make the breakthrough, you've got something better than any bomb ever built, because when you finally come down the line you're talking about controlling people's minds,'' <PERSON> Cesaro </PERSON> said. Another research effort whose results proved highly controversial was the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s secret genetic testing program, carried out from 1966 to 1969 under the cover name of the `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Viral Study.'' This project involved taking blood samples from embassy personnel exposed to the Soviet microwaves and from a control group and analyzing the white blood cells for possible chromosomal damage. Those who were tested were not told the actual purpose, but instead were given the cover story about checking for a viral condition. By late 1968 concern about results of the cytogenetic testing had mounted among senior officials privy to the findings, and the university contractor, Dr. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, urged that the study be continued and expanded. In mid-1969, however, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> abruptly decided to terminate the study, after having test slides re-examined by four outside consultants. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steneck </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> history professor and author of a book, `` The Microwave Debate,'' said the cytogenetic testing program `` was set aside on the shoddiest and shakiest of grounds.'' `` At the very least there was scientific ambiguity, because there were some researchers who said the techniques were very good and that they did see effects,'' <PERSON> Steneck </PERSON> said. `` If nothing else, on the basis of that you do a follow-up study _ you do n't just crank it down.'' Asked about <PERSON> Steneck </PERSON>'s remarks, Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> assistant medical director for environmental health and preventive medicine, said he had not been with the department at the time of the genetic testing program and would prefer not to comment. Government officials and outside experts say one of the biggest lessons learned from the microwave problem was that it was a mistake to keep the radiation secret from most employees until February 1976, when the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began briefing current, former and prospective <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> personnel. `` The main lesson is to be upfront with employees about things that they might consider to affect their health and well-being,'' said <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official.

 <PERSON> Koslov </PERSON> was stronger in his criticism of the secrecy. `` I think it was handled very badly. There was no reason why they could n't have informed the embassy personnel early on ... The lesson learned is to treat your people as though they have some intelligence.'' After the radiation problem became publicly known in 1976, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denied press reports _ including a story in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> _ that the problem was exacerbated by radio-frequency and microwave emissions from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> equipment. But a Dec. 5, 1975 <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> memorandum dealing with the Soviet beams said: `` Some embassy staff members probably have received much larger exposures of electromagnetic radiation due to leakage in coaxial cable shields for cables running through the embassy interior from transmitters to antennas. This problem may not be limited to the embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' In other documents, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> also expressed concern over high-frequency radio radiation induced in telephone and other wiring leading into the ambassador's ninth-floor office, due to spillover from a miniloop antenna mounted outside. The antenna was subsequently moved to a different location on the embassy roof. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodeur </PERSON>, author of `` The Zapping of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' a book dealing with the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy affair and other cases of microwave exposure, said he had been told by intelligence sources, whom he declined to identify, that `` there was always a question whether our own electronic countermeasures within the embassy were responsible for some of the irradiation of the employees.'' `` A good many of the biological-medical problems at the embassy may well have been caused by our own efforts to jam the low-level incoming <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> signals,'' <PERSON> Brodeur </PERSON> said. The belated disclosure of the microwave bombardment prompted a series of administrative claims and lawsuits against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government by employees and dependents who alleged that they had suffered health injuries because of exposure to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> beams. To help defend itself against such legal actions, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1976-78 funded a $ 1 million epidemiological study of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy personnel, carried out under contract by the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hygiene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> medical consultant, said that `` without that <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> study, State would be sitting in the soup, because there were about $ 250 million in tort actions on the books. And every one of those has been withdrawn without a penny being paid.'' `` There were about 100 some-odd actions,'' <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> said. A <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> woman whose son was born with spina bifida, a serious birth defect, declined to comment in detail on the status of an administrative claim she brought against the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1977. The woman, who asked that her name not be used, said regarding the possibility that her son's birth defect may have been linked to microwave exposure in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>: `` The only thing I can say is that it's impossible to know. ... There's no way we'll ever, ever know. That's the one thing I have learned.'' Another case involved a $ 1.75 million suit brought against the government on behalf of a boy born in 1973 with severe hydrocephalus, a birth defect of the brain and central nervous system. The boy's father had served in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> security guard. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danelo </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> attorney, said the suit brought in federal court in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> alleged injury due to microwave radiation as well as medical malpractice at <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> hospitals. The microwave part of the suit was dismissed by the trial court. The court cited what is known as the Feres doctrine, under which the federal government can not be held liable for injuries suffered by active-duty military personnel _ or, in this case, for a child's physical injuries derived from his father's active-duty injury <PERSON> Danelo </PERSON> said the malpractice part of the case also proved unsuccessful. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaither </PERSON>, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of the Legal Adviser, said, `` we had a group of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> microwave files and they were all retired because they were not being actively pursued.'' He said he was unable to confirm <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s figures on the total number and dollar amount of the claims because the files have been sent to a federal records storage center in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> epidemiological study, released in November 1978, concluded that `` no convincing evidence was discovered that would directly implicate the exposure to microwave radiation by the employees at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy in the causation of any adverse health effects as of the time of this analysis.'' Critics of the study, however, have voiced concern over the use of employees and dependents from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies and consulates in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a control group for comparison to the health experience of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy personnel. A confidential draft version of the study report itself noted that some of the members of the control group could have been exposed `` to microwave surveillance.'' `` This was of concern, especially since several participants in the study informed us that there indeed was surveillance using microwave technology at some of the comparison posts,'' the draft document said. This section was deleted in the final version of the report. According to the minutes of an Oct. 17, 1978 meeting of Dr. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> with members of the study staff, it was deleted because it was `` really heresay.'' At the recommendation of the health study team, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contracted with the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> for preparation of a retrospective technical analysis of the complex microwave radiation fields monitored within the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy. The findings of this technical analysis were evaluated by the <ORGANIZATION> Electromagnetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, known as ERMAC, a now-defunct scientific panel that operated under the aegis of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. In June 1981, a report issued by <ORGANIZATION> NTIA </ORGANIZATION> said the 14-member advisory panel `` agreed that there is no scientific evidence, nor are there any theoretical grounds to suggest that biological effects would be expected to occur from the type and low levels of exposure presented. Consequently, <ORGANIZATION> ERMAC </ORGANIZATION> concluded that no deleterious biological effects to personnel would be anticipated from the microwave exposures at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' However, several experts on non-ionizing radiation say they believe the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and ERMAC may well have jumped to scientifically unwarranted conclusions in seeking to rule out possible health effects on personnel exposed to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> radiation. Among them is the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Steneck </PERSON>, who cited a variety of studies that have been done over the past few years _ since the 1976-78 <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> epidemiological survey _ finding significant effects at very low radiation power levels. `` I can see no reason why I would rest easier today than I would have 10 years ago,'' he said. `` ... As we learn more and more about the ways in which this radiation can interact with the body, we find that there are more subtle ways than we initially suspected.''

 Here is a chronology, from public records, declassified documents and interviews, of major developments concerning the Soviet microwave bombardment of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>: October 1953: Embassy security officers initially detect intermittent Soviet-source microwave transmissions. Late 1962-early 1963: Electronic measurements confirm that the signal, code-named TUMS -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Technically </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unidentified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, is a directional microwave beam aimed at the back of the embassy from a fifth-floor window of an apartment building 100 yards to the west. TUMS is a mix of frequencies ranging from 2.5 to 4.1 GHz -LRB- gigahertz -RRB- and operates at typical maximum power levels of 1 to 3 microwatts per square centimeter. April 4, 1965: The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asks doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, to conduct special eye examinations and electroencephalogram tests on personnel departing for and returning from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. April 16, 1965: The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surveillance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countermeasures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets to discuss the microwave problem. It requests all member agencies to review medical records of personnel assigned to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since 1953 for `` possible clinical changes'' that may be linked with exposure to the radiation. March 29, 1966: The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> signs a contract with <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for cytogenetic testing of blood samples from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and control group personnel. The program is conducted under the cover story of a `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Viral Study.'' June 23-25, 1967: Secretary of State Dean <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> lodges a protest over the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> radiation with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> during a summit meeting in <LOCATION> Glassboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Dec. 20, 1968: A scientific review panel begins to evaluate results from the Pandora Project, a secret research effort involving irradiation of monkeys with a `` synthetic <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> signal.'' April 21, 1969: The <PERSON> Pandora </PERSON> review panel recommends that the experimental program be expanded to include testing of human volunteers exposed to low-level microwaves for six to eight months. June 27, 1969: The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decides to terminate the cytogenetic testing program, on the grounds that the test results were not confirmed by outside medical specialists. Jan. 12, 1970: The Pandora review panel recommends that the research project, conducted primarily at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, be phased out because re-evaluation of the experimental data showed `` no clear and strong effects.'' March 1972: Another signal, code-named SMUT, goes on the air at power levels of less than 1 microwatt and operates intermittently until June 1975. With frequencies of 3.2 to 3.7 GHz, it is beamed from a transmitter about one-half mile northeast of the embassy. May 26, 1975: TUMS ceases operation. May 28, 1975: A Soviet signal code-named MUTS-1 begins daily operation from a transmitter on the roof of an apartment building 80 yards east of the embassy. It is a complex, broadband signal with frequencies in the range of 0.6 to 9.6 GHz and typical maximum power levels of 10 to 12 microwatts. Oct. 16, 1975: Another microwave beam, dubbed MUTS-2, is detected coming from the top of a building 80 yards south of the embassy, with a frequency range comparable to MUTS-1 but lower power levels of 1 to 2 microwatts. While TUMS had operated for about five to eight hours a day, MUTS-1 and MUTS-2 are in operation for up to 14 hours daily, with one or both the signals irradiating the embassy for a total of 18 to 20 hours a day. Jan. 26-30, 1976: A team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts meets with Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in an effort to persuade the Russians to cease irradiating the embassy. The talks prove fruitless, with the Soviets contending that the microwaves detected at the embassy are simply background radiation from broadcast and industrial sources. Feb. 6, 1976: Ambassador <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoessel </PERSON> begins a series of classified briefings on the microwave problem for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy employees and dependents. Word of the briefings leaks to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> correspondents. Security officers and military personnel start installing window screening to reduce penetration of the microwave beams into the building. Feb. 12, 1976: Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> tells a news conference that `` this issue is a matter of great delicacy which has many ramifications.'' He declines to go into detail. Feb. 19, 1976: Members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AFSA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, a union representing <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officers, express concern over the problem and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to brief personnel earlier. July 7, 1976: The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announces that the intensity of the microwave radiation beamed at the embassy has been `` greatly reduced,'' down to 2 microwatts per square centimeter outside the building and a fraction of a microwatt inside. Also announced is the signing of a contract with <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for an epidemiological study of personnel assigned to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and other posts in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Jan. 4, 1977: A notice posted at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy discloses that about one-third of individuals tested have shown abnormally high white blood cell counts. It says the cause for this lymphocytosis condition is unknown. Nov. 20, 1978: Results of the <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> epidemiological study are released and come under criticism by <ORGANIZATION> AFSA </ORGANIZATION>. In a report with numerous caveats and limitations, the study team says `` no convincing evidence'' was found that would directly link exposure to microwave radiation in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with adverse health effects. April 1979: The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> issues a report criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the microwaves affair _ particularly its failure to inform employees from 1953 to 1976 June 1981: A 14-member panel, the <ORGANIZATION> Electromagnetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, concludes `` there is no scientific evidence, nor are there any theoretical grounds to suggest that biological effects would be expected to occur from the type and low levels of exposure presented'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Nov. 10, 1983: Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> tells reporters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that he made a protest to the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> over a microwave beam aimed at the embassy between July 14 and Oct. 19, with a power level of 2 microwatts. March 3, 1988: A statement released by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diplomatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> says that `` microwave signals in the 5-11 GHz range continue to be detected at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy chancery. Typical power levels, it says, are 0.1 microwatt per square centimeter outside the building and 0.01 microwatt inside.

 Public disclosure of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy problem in the mid-1970s spurred a substantial increase of interest among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists in the controversial area of low-level microwave biological effects. `` It had an enormous impact on the microwave research field,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steneck </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> history professor who spent six years studying the field for his book, `` The Microwave Debate.'' For years, most American researchers had assumed that any significant biological effects were thermal _ caused by heating of body tissues. This viewpoint is reflected in the safety limit of 5,000 microwatts per square centimeter set in the current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> voluntary guideline adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, however, has a much lower safety limit of only 10 microwatts, stemming from concern with subtle behavioral and physiological changes as well as subjective symptoms which Soviet researchers have reported with chronic exposure at low power levels. Over the past decade more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists have started paying serious attention to athermal effects, particularly effects on brain tissue of low-intensity microwaves modulated at extremely low frequencies. Since the early 1980s, however, federal government support for non-ionizing radiation bioeffects research has declined markedly. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Adey </PERSON>, a leading researcher based at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee last Oct. 6 that current levels of government funding _ now about $ 7 million a year _ are `` disastrously low.'' `` There is reason to believe that this situation has arisen in part through a well-organized activity on the part of major corporate entities from the consumer and military electronic industries to discredit all research into athermal biological and biomedical effects,'' <PERSON> Adey </PERSON> said. Also expressing strong concern over the funding cutback was <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Healer </PERSON>, a non-ionizing radiation specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unfortunately, this well has dried up at a time when ... there are some directions to follow that are very, very interesting,'' she said, adding: `` We're quitting at the wrong time.'' Meanwhile, the Soviets continue to devote substantial and expanding resources to their own research program. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Slesin </PERSON>, editor of Microwave News, a newsletter covering the non-ionizing radiation research field, said that `` what is clear is that Soviet researchers are extremely interested in the effects of this kind of radiation.'' `` Everybody who's come back after looking at -LRB- Soviet -RRB- laboratories has been virtually green with jealousy on seeing what the Russians have in terms of equipment, in terms of their budgets and staff working in this area,'' <PERSON> Slesin </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Milk Producers Seek New Solution to Production Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> says dairy farmers have been squeezed enough by the administration's price strategy to trim surplus production It's time to try an alternative short-term remedy such as another dairy termination program -LRB- DTP -RRB-, or a diversion program, at least until some basic changes in the dairy program can be worked out with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the federation says. A DTP could be designed to offer dairy farmers another chance of selling all or part of their herds, thereby reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> milk production. Or a diversion program could provide payments for reductions in milk sold on the market. Both programs have been tried in recent years, but neither has provided permanent solutions to the surplus problem. Indeed, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, milk production probably will rise to another record level in 1988 after declining slightly last year. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Canon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, dairy farmer, is president of the 72-year-old federation, which represents virtually all of the nation's dairy farmer cooperatives and their members. `` Enough is enough,'' <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON> said here last week. `` Dairy farmers are tired of suffering continual price reductions after having done more to address federal policy concerns than any segment of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. agriculture.'' <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON> referred to a string of reductions in the national price support level of milk since it rose to a peak of $ 13.10 per 100 pounds in 1983. In January, under a formula provided by the 1985 farm law, the support was reduced again by 50 cents to the current level of $ 10.60 per hundredweight. The law also provides for an additional 50-cent cut to $ 10.10 next Jan. 1 if <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> again projects that it will have to buy the equivalent of more than 5 billion pounds of surplus milk in 1989 to prop up prices. If the surplus continues beyond next year, the law provides for another 50-cent reduction to $ 9.60 on Jan. 1, 1990. Last year, when milk output was 142.5 billion pounds, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bought butter, cheese and non-fat dry milk equivalent to more than 6.7 billion pounds of milk. That was down dramatically from CCC purchases, or `` removals'' from the market in 1986 of 10.6 billion pounds out of the year's production of 143.4 billion pounds. Milk production in 1988 is expected to rise 2 percent to 3 percent this year, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s revised estimates, and net removals by CCC are expected to be in the range of 7 billion to 9 billion pounds, milk equivalent. Camerlo and other federation officials want to head off the further reduction in milk supports on Jan. 1, 1989, by pressuring <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> to design an alternative, which is also authorized by the 1985 farm law. And that could be another DTP, also called a whole-herd buyout, or a diversion program. In the past programs, dairy farmers were helped finance their own payments through assessments on milk marketed. In the case of the $ 1.8 billion in whole-herd buyout payments, for example, about 38 percent was provided by assessments. But <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> has been steadfast in opposing another buyout or diversion program, federation leaders say. Therefore, dairy farmers are being asked to put pressure on members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as well as on <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, to avoid the next 50-cent cut in supports. One of the arguments used by the federation is that part of the recent slide in dairy supports has been accompanied by an easing of production costs, mainly lower feed prices. But now, with grain exports and the economy rebounding, costs are going up again. Thus, the federation says it makes sense to put brakes on the slide in milk supports, or else see thousands of dairy farmers hurt economically. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists, the price of `` manufacturing'' milk used to make butter, cheese and other products averaged $ 12.27 per hundredweight in the first three months of 1988, down 63 cents from a year ago. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in a new outlook report that milk prices paid to farmers `` probably will remain below a year earlier and average 5 percent to 7 percent lower for all of 1988.'' But the report also noted that the average value of dairy feed, or concentrate, was $ 7.09 per 100 pounds as of April 1, up about 40 cents from a year earlier. For all of 1988, the cow ration value may average 25 to 45 cents higher than last year's $ 6.75 per hundredweight, the report said. Alfalfa hay prices also are higher, averaging $ 69 per ton at the farm in the first quarter, compared with $ 61 a year ago. Meanwhile, consumer prices of dairy products `` continue to show smaller year-to-year increases'' than the government's all-food or all-item index of retail prices, the report said. Dairy prices will probably decline through midyear, followed by some seasonal increase in the second half.

 The chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says the company is trying to come up with programming that will regain the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> network's leadership of the prime time audience ratings. But <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> was criticized Wednesday by some shareholders, one of whom said <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> had destroyed a company that was the `` class of the industry'' by selling off several of its major businesses. <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> responded by telling the company's stockholders at their annual meeting that the recent sales of the CBS magazine and music businesses had produced `` excellent returns'' and allowed the company to focus on its core broadcasting business. <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> also said he was looking for opportunities to use some of CBS' $ 3 billion cash hoard to buy television or radio stations. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has four TV stations that cover about 20 percent of the country and, under federal rules, can buy additional stations extending that coverage up to 25 percent. <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> also repeated earlier assertions that neither the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television network nor <ORGANIZATION> Loews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 24.9 percent stake in the company were for sale. In addition to heading <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Loews </ORGANIZATION>, which has interests in insurance, tobacco and hotels. He said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had no plans to sell its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters building, nicknamed <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Rock </PERSON>, a move that had been rumored for weeks. Since the last shareholders meeting, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> sold its magazine group for $ 650 million and its CBS records operation for $ 2 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television network finished in third place in prime time ratings for the first time during the season that just ended. <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> noted that asset sales had boosted the company's capital and that net interest income reached $ 51.7 million in the first quarter in contrast to net interest expense of $ 9.3 million in the same period of 1987. But <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a longtime <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> shareholder and an executive with the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> division that was sold as part of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> records group sale, told <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> he seemed more interested in `` running a closed-end mutual fund with the revenues derived from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> assets'' than in broadcasting. He said the asset sales might have pleased Wall Street, but had demoralized remaining <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> employees and `` effectively destroyed something that was very near and dear to many of us _ a once great company, a company that many considered to be the gem, the class of the industry.'' Colin is among a group of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> records executives who have sued <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, claiming they were wrongfully denied more than $ 1 million in bonuses for 1987. While <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> did not comment directly on <PERSON> Colin </PERSON>'s statement, he said later in the 2 -LCB- - hour meeting that the network had some `` exciting new programs'' for the next TV season and that employee morale was `` very high. `` We are ready to take on the world in the battle to regain the No. 1 position,'' he said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> chairman, did n't attend the meeting, but sent remarks in which he said he had reviewed the pilots for next season and found them `` imaginative and exciting. I believe that they represent the first step in our recovery of our premier position in the industry.'' Assessing the outlook for broadcast advertising, <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said the first half of 1988 has `` not proved to be as strong as originally estimated, and the industry outlook for the third quarter is less optimistic than anticipated.'' He said this and the delay in the start of the fall television season due to the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> strike made it impossible to estimate <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> earnings for the year. But he added the company did not anticipate a severe drop in profit.

<TEXT>
 Computers and robotics that slash the time it takes to make a sailboat mast have helped a <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> company become the world's largest automated maker of aluminum masts. <ORGANIZATION> Isomat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has reduced mast production time for the average 35-foot sloop-rigged sailboat by nearly 90 percent _ from 75 hours to about eight _ says <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaught </PERSON>, general manager of <PERSON> Isomat </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> plant. The company is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which through its Sparcraft unit supplied the masts for the 12-meter contenders in the last <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup yacht challenge, including the Stars and Stripes and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s Kookaburra II. Since opening three years ago, the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> plant, which employs about 50 people, has captured about 70 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market and 85 percent of the Canadian market, company officials said. Isomat <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufactures 15 to 20 aluminum masts per day with its unique automated system. `` We're set up to run 30 a day,'' said <PERSON> Vaught </PERSON>. `` Most shops ca n't do that many in a month.'' Isomat <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> had about $ 3 million in sales last year. Its masts range in price from about $ 600 to $ 4,000, depending on the size and options. `` Ninety-nine percent of our business is with boat builders, who are as price-conscious as anybody,'' <PERSON> Vaught </PERSON> said during a recent tour of the facility. Isomat officials do n't anticipate a time when all sailboat masts will be manufactured by an automated system. Some sailboat builders manufacture their own masts and other `` Mom and Pop'' companies will continue to sell enough masts to stay in business. Another <ORGANIZATION> IMI </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary _ <ORGANIZATION> Kenyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> _ sells between 80 and 100 masts a month, although its masts take five times as long to manufacture and therefore are more expensive, <PERSON> Vaught </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> IMI </ORGANIZATION> recently moved its Kenyon operations from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> to take advantage of some of <PERSON> Isomat </PERSON>'s automated processes. `` They -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Kenyon </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are after a different market,'' <PERSON> Vaught </PERSON> said. `` There are people who spend $ 40,000 on a 40-foot sailboat, and people who spend $ 140,000.'' Isomat engineers, designs, finishes and assembles sailing systems with extrusions produced in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and aluminum castings shipped in by its sister facility in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Using its automated system, the company can handle custom orders from about 40 different boat builders, <PERSON> Vaught </PERSON> said. Isomat uses computer-assisted machines to taper the masts and to cut them for attachment of the various fittings and other hardware. Sailboat masts are tapered at the top to reduce weight and minimize air turbulence. After tapering, the mast is coated with a special anodizing film to prevent abrasion and corrosion in the marine environment. `` The biggest advantage aluminum has over wood is that it does n't rot,'' <PERSON> Vaught </PERSON> said. `` This process adds 10 years to the life of an aluminum mast.'' To treat the long masts, Isomat designed its own tanks. The 11 tanks are 70 feet long and capable of coating masts up to 69 feet long. <PERSON> Vaught </PERSON> said the company also can finish items such as light and flag poles, stadium seating, and other architectural components. The system was designed with production and flexibilty in mind because the market for sailboats is widely varied. `` There's a lot of custom-ordering and we have to be able to supply it,'' <PERSON> Vaught </PERSON> said.

 Still trying to rebound from October's world stock market crash, the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has set its sights on grabbing business from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets. Exchange officials hope their advanced automated trading system, which has been licensed to several foreign exchanges, proves a key advantage in luring Canadian companies that now trade primarily in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The exchange, which lists 1,600 stocks and accounts for 77 percent of Canadian trading, got a jolt on Wednesday when share prices tumbled in the biggest one-day decline in four months, raising fears of an impending economic recession. The exchange's 300 stock composite index closed down 63.82 points at 3,228.68 on Wednesday, the largest drop since a 118-point tumble on Jan. 8. The drop, which mirrored a sharp decline on Wall Street caused by rising interest rates and recessionary jitters, was the latest setback for a market where activity has slackened significantly since the Oct. 19 crash. Since then, the number of investors has declined by 10 percent and the dollar value of trading has dropped 41 percent. In light of that trend and the increasingly global nature of securities trading, the agenda for exchange President <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunting </PERSON> and other officials is to use their market's technological assets to drum up business. The <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> almost exclusively lists Canadian companies, but about 55 major players trade the bulk of their shares on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bunting </PERSON> plans to promote his exchange via the Computer Assisted Trading System, known as CATS, that it pioneered and now licenses to the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> stock exchanges. `` We will set up an electronic central order book system,'' he said. `` All bids and offers will meet electronically in the middle. In the end, you can envisage thousands of terminals around the world that would be connected with our system. `` It will give us the opportunity to be one step up on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' The push for more business comes with the the October crash still fresh on the minds of local traders, especially during Wednesday's decline. `` There's a lot of nervousness out there and investors will jump on any bit of information,'' said analyst <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON> of the firm <ORGANIZATION> Davidson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're worried about a recession.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> led major developed countries last year with real growth of 3.9 percent. The strong economy, and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of maintaining a 2.5 to 3 percentage point interest rate spread over rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, helped boost the Canadian dollar to an exchange rate of 81 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cents from 69 cents since 1986. But government figures for January and February showed growth and job creation at a standstill. In six weeks, the leaders of the Group of Seven countries and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> will gather in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> for an economic summit to discuss how to avert another market crash and recession. But with President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in his final months in office, local traders were not confident the summit would tackle what they see as the epicenter of economic unrest: the huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget and trade deficits. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bainbridge </PERSON>, an equity trader for <ORGANIZATION> Gordon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of 75 members on the exchange, also said: `` Historically, after every American presidential election the market goes down for two years.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is laying off about 700 employees because of job redundancies and attrition following its February acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company has announced. The reduction amounts to about 5 percent of Prime's worldwide workforce of 13,500, the company said Wednesday in a prepared statement. The layoffs will occur over the rest of the year. Prime attributed the layoffs to the conclusion of its integration with <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION>, including a new management structure, new product strategies and excess production capacity.

<HEAD>USG Appears to Win Proxy Battle, But Takeover War May Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> appears to have the won the proxy battle, but <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION> is n't ready to concede the takeover war. `` We believe our slate has been elected,'' <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> said Wednesday, claiming shareholders had supported a management-backed slate over a rival one supporting <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' hostile takeover bid. The vote for six seats on the Chicago-based company's 15-member board of directors was seen as a turning point in the nearly eight-month battle for control of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>, a building-materials producer. Official results wo n't be announced until May 20. But Day told reporters after the annual shareholders meeting that proxies received before the close of balloting indicated the management-backed slate would get more than 50 percent of the votes. The proxy battle pitted a slate led by <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' two main investors, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilmen <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, against the USG slate that included three members of the current management. `` We're going to continue to pursue our acquisition,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' chief financial officer, maintaining it was too early to predict the election's outcome. Day said the vote reflects `` stockholder confidence in management's ability,'' adding that USG would not pay out any `` greenmail'' to the <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, Texas-based investment group. <PERSON> Greenmail </PERSON> is a premium price paid by a company for the stock of a would-be acquirer that is not offered to other shareholders. Some investment analysts have predicted <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> might start selling off its nearly 10 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> if it decisively lost the proxy battle. But <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said, `` We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.'' In the takeover battle marked by lawsuits on both sides, <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> executives have contended <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> launched its bid only to recoup losses in their USG holdings following October's stock market crash. `` We've thought all along that <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> wanted to recover the investment they made at a bad time,'' Day said. Desert Partners has accused <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> executives of trying to entrench themselves with a `` poison-pill'' defense designed to hinder the takeover bid. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> announced a defensive recapitalization plan and business restructuring plan to counter the Texans' offer. The USG plan, to be submitted to a shareholders' vote June 24, will pay stock owners $ 37 in cash, debentures with a face value of $ 5 and a share of stock in the recapitalized corporation for each of the 51.5 million common shares. The company would sell off two subsidiaries to finance the deal. In March, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 42 per share in a hostile tender offer for 39 million USG shares, or a 76 percent stake in the company. That bid has a value of about $ 2.2 billion and remains in effect. Desert Partners subsequently indicated it was willing to pay $ 45 per share, and <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> told the shareholders' meeting the Texans might be willing to pay up to $ 50 a share. USG stock, which dropped below $ 30 per share after the market crash, is currently selling in the $ 44 - $ 46 per-share range

<HEAD>Casey Says `Workout Bank' Will Be Used In Reorganization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 First <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said he does not plan to remain at the troubled holding company after its restructuring begins, and said a search for his replacement has already begun. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said Wednesday one of the candidates for the chairmanship is <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Musolino </PERSON>, who is not seeking re-election to the board of directors at the company's annual meeting next month. The company's restructuring is not likely to be completed before a review of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION>'s loan portfolio is finished in late June. He also said the Dallas-based bank holding company, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> largest, hopes to present a restructuring plan by mid-July that will include creation of a `` workout bank'' containing troubled loans. In a meeting with reporters, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said officials believe the $ 1.5 billion loss the bank holding company suffered in the first quarter of this year should prevent any further huge writedowns. `` The big body blow is over,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said, while adding that the company `` will continue with some loan losses.'' First Republic is working with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to establish the workout bank. That bank would be secured by junk bonds sold to investors. The workout bank would repay notes from the disposition of its holdings, and could include a mechanism that would allow investors to share in an appreciation of real estate holdings from their current market value. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s comments came a month after he took over from <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronterhouse </PERSON> and almost two months after the company received a $ 1 billion cash infusion from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The chairman said the institution has heard two expressions of interest from investors. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which is handling other inquiries, said it also has heard from several possible investors. First RepublicBank's asset base shrunk from $ 33.2 billion at the end of 1987 to $ 28.4 billion as of March 31. Holders of First Republic's $ 1.3 billion in long-term debt will likely settle for a fraction of face value in the form of new debt that will be issued by the restructured company, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. `` If you look at the balance sheet, -LRB- small holders -RRB- have been wiped out,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, whose non-performing assets totaled $ 4.5 billion as of March 31, has stopped making real estate loans `` even with the biggest and the best in the real estate business,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>London Shares Up 15.3 Points</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices were broadly higher, at the day's best levels, at midday Thursday in what dealers called a technical reaction to the previous day's abrupt drop But trading volumes remained low. Other than a `` little dribbly buying,'' most of the gains came from price mark-ups, a dealer said. An absence of selling also underpinned prices, he said. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 15.3 points, or 0.9 percent, at 1,772.1 at about 12:30 p.m. -LRB- 1130 GMT -RRB-. The index fell 35.8 points on Wednesday. Volume was light at 191.1 million shares compared with 355.7 million at the same time Wednesday. The market also was helped by belated response to some some favorable corporate earnings reports. Shares in some companies that reported their results on Wednesday were initially unmoved amid general market preoccupation with the near-term course of international interest rates. But the results were reflected in share prices on Thursday. Elsewhere, shares in <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> fell 19 pence, or 36 cents, to 885 pence, or $ 16.64, below the effective price of 901.5 pence, or $ 16.95, being offered by <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> in a hostile takeover bid. It was the first time the British confectioners' shares have fallen below <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s offer price since the Swiss company launched its bid last month. Dealers said the price decline reflected increased market speculation that the bid could be investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, amid mounting political pressure for such an inquiry.

<HEAD>Question of Corporate Responsibility May Be Decided in Wisconsin
Steel Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 11 years after its ill-fated sale of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Steel </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is being sued in a case that could answer the far-reaching question of how much a company can be obligated to pay retired and laid-off workers. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> is accused of selling the money-losing steel unit in 1977 to <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> engineering company with no steel-making experience _ in a bid free itself of multimillion-dollar pension payouts and other employee-benefit obligations. In a trial scheduled to begin today before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the federal insurer of pensions, is seeking $ 145 million _ $ 63 million in unpaid benefits for the laid-off or retired steelworkers, plus interest. In the second lawsuit, <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> creditors _ including an <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION> unit, the <ORGANIZATION> EDC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ are seeking $ 177 million from <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>, charging fraud and racketeering in the 1977 sale of the steel company. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1977, lent <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION> $ 50 million to finance the $ 65 million acquisition of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Steel. Harvester's own investment bankers and lawyers had cautioned against the sale. The trial's outcome could well determine whether _ and to what extent _ the government and others can force corporations to honor pension-plan obligations to workers. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> already has reached a $ 14.8 million out-of-court settlement with 2,700 former employees of the steel company. The workers had sought $ 86 million in claims for benefits lost when the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> steel mill was shuttered. The government and the workers filed lawsuits against <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> in 1981, little more than a year after <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION>, operating as <ORGANIZATION> EDC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court and closed the plant. The filing came after <ORGANIZATION> EDC </ORGANIZATION>'s key lenders, <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, called in collateral for past loans. <ORGANIZATION> EDC </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. The issue took on added significance last year when Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> tried to unload $ 2.1 billion in pension obligations on the federal government. The <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> already is stuck with $ 2 billion in underfunded pension liabilities from other companies, and its responsibility could climb to $ 4 billion if it loses its court battle with <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>. In its annual report, the federal pension insurer said `` a company can not escape financial responsibility for its pension plans by transferring them to a weak third party that can not successfully continue the business or fund the pension plans.''

<HEAD>Griffin-Trump Deal For Resorts International Collapses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Millionaire investors <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> resumed their battle over <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> after the collapse of an agreement for <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> to buy the hotel-casino company <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> controls. The handshake deal, less than a month old, foundered Wednesday amid a welter of accusations from <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, each blaming the other. In a move recalling the bitter, month-long feud that preceded the April 14 sale agreement, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> vowed to renew a $ 36-a-share offer with the outside directors of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, N.J.-based company. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> responded that the one-time talk show host would never own Resorts as long as he, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, retained control of 88 percent of the voting shares. `` It's like going back to the day before <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> shook hands,'' <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said of the falling out. The failed agreement, which capped months of maneuvering by the two high-profile businessmen, called for <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 207 million, or $ 36 a share, for publicly held Resorts stock. That included all 5.7 million Class A shares and the 5.3 percent of Class B shares that are n't held by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. It also called for <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> to acquire <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s Class B shares, which give him 88 percent voting control of Resorts, and to sell the massive, unfinished <PERSON> Taj </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahal </PERSON> casino back to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has refused to disclose the price offered for his stake in Resorts, acquired last year from heirs of company founder <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> for an amount estimated by analysts at $ 101 million. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> had sought last-minute changes in the agreement and had failed to prove he could obtain financing. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> predicted failure for <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s new overtures to Resorts. `` Mr. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> can approach anyone that he wants to but it is Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s position that Mr. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> will be unable to purchase the company in that way,'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will resist any action by Mr. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> in this regard.'' In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, described his boss as `` surprised and disappointed that <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was unwilling to proceed with the transaction.'' `` Financing was never an issue in the negotiations,'' <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> said. `` Indeed, the impasse arose from Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s refusal to abide by the original terms of the deal and to accept the fact that the existing Resorts hotel-casino would remain a viable competitor -LRB- to the Taj Mahal -RRB-.'' The battle pits two of the nation's wealthiest entrepreneurs against each other. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who recently turned heads by offering to take over repairs of a closed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bridge from the city, is listed by <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> as worth at least $ 850 million. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, 23-year host of the television talk show that bore his name and creator of the hit game shows `` Jeopardy'' and `` Wheel of Fortune,'' is listed as being worth $ 300 million.

<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has introduced a new line of high-performance products that allows customers to turn their typewriters into modified word processors. The Wheelwriter Series II of four typewriters was unveiled during a news conference Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> also presented an entry-level Personal Wheelwriter, a new version of the Quietwriter 8 typewriter and two new `` Easystrike'' typewriter ribbons. `` It's a triumph of teamwork and technology,'' <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s laboratory chief, said of the typewriters. The Wheelwriter 10, 30, 50 and 70 all include spelling aids while the 50 and 70 have 25-line CRT display. They include options to expand memory to 720,000 bytes with a diskette drive. They also allow customers to upgrade from one product in the series to another by making relatively inexpensive additions as they need them. The typewriters were developed and will be manufactured at <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> facility, said <PERSON> Kailash </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joshi </PERSON>, site general manager `` They are made in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and made in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joshi </PERSON>, adding that the products `` demonstrate <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to the typewriter.'' The suggested retail prices for the typewriters range from $ 599 for the Personal Wheelwriter to $ 1,795 for the Wheelwriter 70. Wheelwriter 3 and 6 Series II are enhanced versions of earlier models, with the main difference being the ability to upgrade to 30, 50 and 70 typewriters. He said during the past three years more than 1 million Wheelwriters have been sold, indicating `` a strong customer demand for office typewriters.'' The 3, 6, 10 and 30 are on the market now, while the 70 will be available in late May and the 50 in mid-June, the company said.

<HEAD>Report: Agreement To Keep Shoreham Closed Is Near</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HICKSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Several `` agreements in principle'' that would bring about the abandonment of the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant have been reached by the state and the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a published report says. Under the agreements, which must be approved by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>, the state would gain control of <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> for $ 1 and shut it down, marking the first time a completed nuclear plant would be shut down before it began operating, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Thursday editions. <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay the estimated $ 400 million to $ 500 million costs of the shutdown, the newspaper said, quoting state officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Times said the agreements included guarantees to <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> of annual rate increases of 4 percent to 5 percent for the next decade and the restoration of dividends to the company's shareholders beginning in 1989. Also, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> would take a $ 2.5 billion tax write-off for the plant, meaning it would pay no federal taxes for at least a decade, the newspaper said. And the state would let the utility float $ 100 million in tax-exempt industrial development bonds that could be used to refinance more expensive debt, the Times reported. The $ 5.3 billion plant has been a rallying cry for opponents of nuclear energy, politicians campaigning for office and the utility, which contends the plant's energy was essential if the island was to have enough energy into the next century. Although the plant was supported by state and local officials when construction first began in the 1970s, opposition grew as nuclear energy became less popular and more expensive and as the completion of the plant fell behind 10 years and 10 times over budget. State and local officials argued that <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> could never be quickly evacuated in an emergency and they refused to participate in any emergency plans for the plant, located 55 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, created to consider a <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> takeover, is continuing its proxy battle to elect three of its nominees to <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors.

 Although <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> says it wants good relations with <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees, the workers plan to tell the king and queen of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> they want no relations at all with <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s directors have rejected a $ 182 million, $ 48-a-share offer from <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION>, a giant appliance manufacturer. <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which makes lawn mowers and bicycles at <LOCATION> Lawrenceburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and is headquartered in <LOCATION> Brentwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> employees said they plan to send a petition to the king and queen of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> opposing the takeover The petition will be signed by 5,000 residents of <LOCATION> Lawrenceburg </LOCATION> and will accompany a letter to the president of <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, protesting the takeover effort, a spokesman said. The employees' news conference came a day after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> refused to lift a temporary restraining order suspending further action by <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> concerning <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Scharp </PERSON> issued a statement which said, in part, `` <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> has no plans whatever to close the <LOCATION> Lawrenceburg </LOCATION> plant.'' <PERSON> Scharp </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> wants to own and operate the plant. `` We need a good relationship at <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION>. We regret that the understandable fears and concerns of <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> employees in this situation appear to have been exploited,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, head of the employees' `` Just Say Nej'' committee, said committee members believe the takeover is a threat to the <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s 3,000 employees. `` Nej'' -LRB- pronounced `` nay'' -RRB- is Swedish for `` no.'' A copy of the letter to <PERSON> Scharp </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> was released at a news conference, along with a copy of an advertisement that is to appear in major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspapers and a <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> newspaper on May 13. The letter said, in part, `` We do not dislike you, your company or the people of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. ... Our relationship with <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> is that of a family ... They've been exceptional as an employer, and community leader and friend.'' Among other things, the ads say, `` We've seen too many workers lose their jobs, their identity and their self-respect as independent firms fall prey to hostile outside interests. ... When pushed, we can be hostile too.'' <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>'s ruling was viewed as a victory, allowing <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> more time to fight the takeover. Among other things, <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> ordered the case moved from the state <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lawrenceburg </LOCATION> to his court in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scharp </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> is committed to purchasing <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> stock even though it has run against initial roadblocks. <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> released a list showing layoffs by <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> after takeovers of plants in Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belding </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. As to whether there would be layoffs in <LOCATION> Lawrenceburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said, `` It's an unknown. It scares everybody.'' <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who helped gather the signatures on the petition, said, `` We like things like they are.'' <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said the petition will be accompanied by a package containing `` samples of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> foods. That's the closest we want them to get here.'' The petition and package will be delivered today to Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>., in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who will accompany employee leaders to the Swedish embassy <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said they will ask the ambassador to deliver the petition `` to the king and queen of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>.'' The proposed newspaper ad, signed `` The Working Men and Women of <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>,'' also says in part, `` We will not stand by and see our company, our economy and our values compromised. Because money may buy our company's stock but not our loyalty. `` We, the workers of <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, urge the management of <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw their bid immediately. Or we will never be the same company again.''

<HEAD>Texas Will Appeal Federal Judge's Ruling On Florida Citrus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> will appeal a federal judge's ruling that blocks efforts to keep fresh <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus out of the <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, an official said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> ruled Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> did nothing wrong when it lifted a 3 -LCB- - year ban on shipments of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fruit to other citrus-producing areas `` We told the attorney general today that we'd like him to start putting the paperwork together'' for an appeal, said <ORGANIZATION> TDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodfin </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fruit was quarantined after an outbreak of citrus canker in parts of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in August 1984. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 11 lifted the ban on shipments of fresh <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other citrus-producing areas. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials had sought to have the quarantine reinstated and claimed the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> did not allow adequate time for comment when it lifted the ban. <PERSON> Vela </PERSON>'s ruling Wednesday was in response to a suit filed March 9 by the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which was trying to stop shipments of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fruit to the state. The suit contends that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> violated its own rules by failing to allow a comment period before lifting the ban. `` With all the information put before me, I am satisfied that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> followed the law'' in promulgating the rule, <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> said Wednesday. The judge said the new protocol is so similar to one the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> proposed last fall but withdrew in January that there had been plenty of time for comment. Canker, which comes in different strains, can damage the plants and cause lesions on the fruit or make it drop prematurely from trees. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> citrus producers say an outbreak of canker would devastate the state's $ 65 million citrus industry concentrated on 30,000 acres in <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Willacy </LOCATION> counties in the Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` We've maintained all along that the risk of our getting canker is relatively small, but it's a risk we do n't believe we ought to take,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Prewett </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION>, a McAllen-based industry group. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials have maintained that the canker is under control.

 The stock market edged upward today, recovering some of Wednesday's losses. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.13 to 1,971.98 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 532 up, 337 down and 502 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 42.43 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. More than half of that total took place in a single stock _ <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, unchanged at 24 -LRB- on turnover of more than 25 million shares. Analysts said the activity reflected trading strategies based on the company's impending quarterly dividend. At current levels Avon shares sport an annual yield of 8.3 percent. Otherwise, analysts said investors were doing a little tentative buying in stocks depressed by Wednesday's selloff, which came amid increasing worries about rising interest rates. Rates moved up a bit again this morning, however, on continuing talk that strength in the economy might increase inflationary pressures. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that retail sales fell 0.6 percent in April, but it also revised the figure for March to a 1.7 percent gain from a previously estimated rise of 0.8 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose .34 to 143.82.

 A drain on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpiles and drought problems in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> are raising prospects for American soybean farmers. Soybean futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> jumped Wednesday in response to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures showing tighter supplies of soybeans in the year ahead. The harvest forecast in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitor in the world soybean market, was reduced by more than 2 percent from prospects a month ago, according to the latest department figures. In a supply-and-demand report issued on Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projected that the nation's stockpile could decline to 145 million bushels at the close of the next marketing year on Aug. 31, 1989, from around 275 million bushels on Sept. 1, 1988. According to department records, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean inventory carried over into the new marketing year on Sept. 1, 1989, would be the smallest in at least five years and possibly longer. The Sept. 1 inventory was 436 million bushels in 1987, a record 536 million in 1986, and 316 million in 1985. The carryover had dropped to 176 million bushels on Sept. 1, 1984, reflecting drought losses in the 1983 harvest. In the 1983-84 marketing year, as a result of the tight supply, soybean prices at the farm averaged an annual record of $ 7.83 per bushel, up from $ 5.65 the previous year. But the upward spike was temporary, and prices tumbled sharply as production increased thereafter. The new projections, which <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials caution are `` highly tentative,'' show that farmers can expect soybean prices to average in the range of $ 5.75 to $ 7.75 per bushel in the 1988-89 marketing year, compared with a reported $ 5.75 this season and $ 4.78 in 1986-87. According to the projections, this year's soybean harvest _ the crop is only about 14 percent planted _ could be around 1.88 billion bushels, slightly less than the 1987 harvest. Counting a Sept. 1 carryover of 275 million bushels, that would mean a soybean supply of around 2.155 billion bushels for the 1988-89 marketing year. Of that, some 1.155 billion bushels are expected to be crushed into high-protein meal and oil. Exports will take an additional 760 million bushels, and seed, feed and other uses will account for more. In all, 1988-89 soybean use is projected at 2.01 billion bushels, meaning some of the Sept. 1 carryover will have to be used to meet next season's demand. Thus, the soybean stockpile could be a relatively skimpy 145 million bushels by Sept. 1, 1989. Historically, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean stockpile a times has been even smaller _ and prices higher. In the early 1970s, for example, the Sept. 1 soybean carryover dropped below 100 million bushels for three consecutive years from a Sept. 1, 1970, inventory of 230 million bushels. Prices, which averaged $ 2.85 per bushel in 1970, rose to an annual average of $ 6.64 per bushel in 1974. After that soybean prices averaged in a range of less than $ 5 per bushel to a peak of $ 6.81 in 1976. In 1980, however, they averaged $ 7.57 per bushel, a record until 1983 when the price went to $ 7.83.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the world's leading hog producer, has ended pork rationing, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. `` A Chinese agriculture official privately stated that pork rationing in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had stopped being enforced,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday `` Other officials said that pork rationing had ended throughout the country, though no official announcement has confirmed this.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began rationing pork in most major cities last fall in response to shortages. Pork traditionally supplies about 80 percent of the total animal protein in the Chinese diet. `` The pork shortages that led to the rationing did not, however, affect <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ability to supply hogs to its limited export markets -LRB- primarily <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' the report said. `` In fact, the country has had a surplus of hogs for export to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, but increases in hog trade between the two countries has been limited by a Chinese export quota.'' An end to rationing `` shows that Chinese agricultural officials believe the tight pork supply situation is now being resolved'' as producers respond to lower feed prices, higher pork prices and government incentives to promote larger production, the report said. `` It also is an indication that many urban consumers are willing to pay more for the higher-quality, free market pork instead of enduring the cheaper, fattier meat that has been sold at lower prices in state markets,'' the report said. A <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> study last year showed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had a 1983 year-end inventory of 298.5 million hogs, compared with 55.8 million in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But with more than five times the number of hogs, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s pork production was less than double the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> output _ 13.2 million metric tons to 7.6 million tons, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> study said. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds. The reason: It took only six months for an American farmer to raise a 243-pound hog ready for slaughter, while a newborn Chinese pig can take from eight to 18 months to reach a comparable slaughter weight. Also, the study said, the average <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hog will produce a dressed-out carcass of about 173 pounds, compared with the Chinese carcass of about 140 pounds.

<TEXT>
 If <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political crisis were resolved tomorrow, it would take at least two years and a vigorous recovery program for the devastated economy to return to the levels of early 1987, according to five of the country's top economists. In the absence of a prompt solution to the crisis, which stems from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and local efforts to topple strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> could be headed for collapse of its productive apparatus, hunger and totalitariansim, the five said Wednesday. Economist <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Carles </PERSON> provided The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> with a copy of the report, entitled `` A Proposal for Economic Reconstruction.'' <PERSON> Carles </PERSON> is a director of a local bank and adviser to several major multinational and Panamanian enterprises. The other authors _ bankers, consultants and academics _ are <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>. They are all, in varying degrees, opponents of the military-dominated government. But the government also recognizes the dire economic consequences of the crisis. Treasury Minister <PERSON> Orvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said Tuesday the gross national product would decrease by up to 20 percent this year. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has for the past 2 -LCB- months imposed increasingly severe economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hoped the measures would force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign and leave the country, but he has resisted the pressure and appears firmly entrenched. The general, who is commander of the Panamanian defense forces, is the country's de facto ruler. In February, he was indicted in federal courts in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug smuggling and money laundering charges. He denies the accusations, contending they are part of an attempt to replace him with a leader amenable to a strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> into the next century. The 1977 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties oblige <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to hand over complete control of the waterway and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases along it by Dec. 31, 1999. The authors of the report say the crisis and resulting sanctions have produced a more than 50 percent decrease in the amount of money circulating in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` That allows for maintenance of likewise less than half the production and transactions normally carried out in the country,'' says the report. Banks, which had been closed for nine weeks, reopened Monday, but with severe restrictions. `` Economic activity is principally dedicated to liquidation of stocks, given that imports are almost nil and it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to finance production,'' the report says. The authors say that, in recent months, unemployment has risen from about 12 percent of the workforce to approximately 20 percent. They say that, even with a political solution in the coming weeks or months, more than 40,000 more people stand to lose their jobs because of the shrinking economy. That would raise unemployment to 26 percent of the workforce. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency. The report's authors said one option open to the Panamanian regime would be `` intervention or nationalization of the banking system and the emission of a local currency with attendant extremely grave economic consequences that would imply a transition toward totalitarianism.'' They propose a series of steps contingent on solution of the political crisis, which would include abandonment of power by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The report says extensive international relief will be needed to alleviate hunger among the poor, who have been battered by the crisis. It says international financial support totaling hundreds of millions of dollars will be necessary. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> would have to provide ample credit to Panamanian banks and the foreign debt of $ 3.9 billion would have to be renegotiated, according to the recovery plan. `` Our plan ... takes as a starting point the recognition that it will take a period of no less than 24 months to return to the levels of production and employment of the first semester of 1987,'' the report says.

<HEAD>The Market Is a Bigger Loser Than Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Day by day it becomes clearer that one of the big losers in the stock market is the market itself. Business is off and layoffs are rising. The public is disaffected with the way the market operates, especially its volatility and seemingly senseless changes of direction. The publicity is negative. Various study groups complain, in effect, that the market has become an assembly of institutional sharpies who skim profits by means of technicalities and sophisticated computer programs. The most devastating criticism comes from within the system itself. Some of the biggest brokers have agreed to shut down their in-house program trading operations, which seek almost automatic profits on technicalities, because angry customers feel such operations work against their interests. The head of a prominent small-investor brokerage house, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON>, has referred to program traders as manipulators. And <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON>'s own operation has been criticized because investors could n't reach brokers on Oct. 19. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said a poll by his company showed individual investors, who generally invest on the basis of a company's management and earnings, feel cheated by market manipulators. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, blunt-speaking former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> this week that the public has a right to believe the marketplace is rigged. `` It is,'' he snapped. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s criticism is especially damaging because in his pre-White House years he was one of the most promiment of all Wall Streeters, head of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> and a leader in bringing individual investors into the markeplace. Anger is also being directed at the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, whose jobs are to protect the public from shenanigans that inevitably arise and must be squashed. The worst of these practices appears to be that of capitalizing on gaps in prices of stock traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and stock index futures traded in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The players often are brokerage houses themselves. When these gaps appear _ gaps that have nothing at all to do with basic values _ they can produce wild price swings as money jumps from one to the other in an attempt to skim off profits. Small investors can not take such advantage. They have too little capital, they have too little time, they have too little sophistication. Gaps are discovered by those with immediate access to data and instant communications. These automatic trading practices, mindlessly initiated by electronic programs that spot opportunities, are believed to have triggered, accelerated and reinforced the crash of last Oct. 19. Oddly, little comment and criticism has been heard from the companies whose stocks are affected. But that criticism is sure to come. Companies such as <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, for example, know that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> investors are inclined to buy <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> products, and they seek to exploit that relationship with reminders in their quarterly reports to shareholders. If these shareholders are n't protected from marketplace shenanigans, it is fair to expect that they will lose their enthusiasm for investing, hurting the value of the corporation's stock and, quite likely, its sales as well So pervasive are the negative comments about program trading that it has, for the time being, overwhelmed concern about the legal problems that had begun to unfold before the Oct. 19 crash and are about to make headlines again. Investigations already have led to jail sentences for several traders, including <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. But those investigations continue; they are expected to bring in other promiment parties, perhaps on criminal charges. Criminality, according to government investigators, is rampant rather than existing on the periphery of the marketplace. In a pre-sentencing memo in the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> case, government officials said they found `` criminal conduct is at the heart of a substantial amount of market activity by established securities industry professionals.'' In short, the marketplace has an odor that drives away customers.

 Retail sales, depressed by bad weather and an early Easter, fell 0.6 percent in April, the first decline in six months, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 131.6 billion last month as sales fell $ 815 million from March. The 0.6 percent drop was the first decline since a 0.8 percent setback last October. The March performance was revised upward, however, to show an increase of 1.7 percent, the biggest advance since August and much stronger than the originally reported 0.8 percent gain. The swings in both months came from the fact that Easter came early this year, meaning that consumers did their spring shopping in March and siphoning off sales from April. In addition, unseasonably cool weather in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> dampened sales for spring apparel as well as for lawn and garden items. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, commenting on the report, said, `` Fortunately, the weakness in April may serve to dampen inflationary expectations.'' Given all the unusual influences, analysts said the weak April sales report did not alter their general assessment that the economy has been performing well so far this year. Total economic activity, as measured by the gross national product, rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first three months of the year, far better than the recession fears immediately following the stock market crash last October would have indicated. The surprisingly strong growth has caused interest rates to rise in recent weeks as investors have begun worrying about inflationary pressures. Major banks boosted their prime lending rate on Wednesday to 9 percent, the first increase since last October. The retail sales report showed widespread weakness in a number of areas. Car sales fell for the first time since November, declining by 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $ 29.7 billion. Strong car sales, propelled by sales incentive programs, have provided much of the overall strength in consumer spending so far this year. Without the weakness in car sales, total retail sales would have been a slightly lower 0.5 percent in April. Sales of all durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, dropped 0.6 percent. Sales of non-durable goods fell an identical 0.6 percent. In the durable goods category, sales at hardware and building supply stores were up 1 percent while sales at furniture stores fell by 0.2 percent. In the non-durable goods cateogry, sales at department stores dropped 0.5 percent, erasing part of the 2.1 percent jump in March. Both months were influenced by the early Easter. Sales at grocery stores fell 0.3 percent in April while sales at gasoline stations were off 1.3 percent and sales at restaurants dropped 1.6 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers ratified a two-year <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> contract by a 54 percent majority, a slim margin <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> blamed on employee anger at the company. `` I thought it would be a little higher, but I understand the concerns of the workers,'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said Wednesday night. He said previous contracts have been ratified with majorities as small as 51 percent. The contract, approved Wednesday, covers 66,000 hourly and salaried workers in 15 states and mirrors job-protecting pacts signed last fall at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. No Chrysler signing date had been set The Big Three contracts prevent layoffs except when production is cut because of slow sales, forbid plant closings not announced before the talks began and make it harder for companies to transfer work to outside companies or foreign countries. The Chrysler contract also provides 3 percent lump-sum bonuses in 1989 and 1990, a $ 1,000 signing bonus and, for the first time, profit-sharing according to the formula that has generated thousands of dollars for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> workers. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> union worker's base wage is now $ 14.43 an hour; the contract does not provide for a raise in base pay but does provide for cost of living adjustments. But unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> contracts, the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> pact prevents executives from receiving bonuses in years when the profit-sharing formula generates no payout for workers. The contract replaces a three-year agreement that would have have expired Sept. 14. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers are more militant than workers at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and `` they're angry with -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> and his high salary. They're really angry with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to transfer the K-car to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> earned $ 17.9 million in 1987, most of it by exercising previously granted stock options. The figure came out the day after the April 18 opening of early negotiations. Two days later, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> confirmed it planned to halt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of its venerable front-wheel-drive K-car and supply <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> buyers from a plant in <LOCATION> Toluca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Both issues nearly derailed negotiations until <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> announced <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> would keep K-car production in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> through the end of the year. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said workers probably were disappointed with the $ 1,000 signing bonus because they received $ 2,120 for signing a three-year contract in 1985. The contract was rejected at several large locals, including the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> K-car plant, union officials said. But at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s 3,500-worker Warren Truck plant, it was approved by 65 percent of those voting, said Local 140 President <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojcik </PERSON>. Two former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> locals in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> also approved separate pacts Wednesday reached during the national contract talks. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> bought AMC in August. The pacts include special payments to workers at former <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> plants in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> says it will close. The Chrysler contract also protects 2,200 workers at four closing <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plants from layoff. <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> is <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s parts subsidiary When the plants close, workers will be paid their regular wages and placed in a job bank for future hire by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 British <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, the world's fourth-largest oil company, said Thursday its first-quarter, after-tax profit sank 43 percent from a year ago because of lower oil <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> said its profit fell to 263 million pounds in the first three months of 1988 from 458 million pounds in the year-earlier period. In dollars, that worked out to $ 473 million as opposed to $ 705 million in the 1987 first quarter, the company said. British companies' accounting method can not be directly compared to the method used by American companies, because of differences in determining the value of inventories. Using the American method, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>'s profit rose by 26 percent, to 408 million pounds, compared with 324 million pounds in the first quarter of 1987. In dollars, that worked out to $ 734 million vs. $ 499 million in the first quarter of 1987. First-quarter revenue fell 8.3 percent, to 6.49 billion pounds, or $ 11.7 billion, from 7.08 billion pounds, or $ 10.9 billion. `` The first quarter of 1988 was characterized by a return to lower oil prices as the market forces of excess supply prevailed, despite continuing political tension in the Gulf,'' <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> said. The fall in the crude price resulted in an inventory loss of 145 million pounds, or $ 261 million, in the first quarter, compared with an inventory gain of 134 million pounds, or $ 206 million, a year ago, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> said. In terms of operating profits, which do not include interest and tax payments, the company said: _ Exploration and production fell to 407 million pounds, or $ 733 million, from 462 million pounds, or $ 711 million, due to lower crude oil prices and adverse exchange rate movements _ Refining and marketing earned 140 million pounds, or $ 252 million, down from 177 million pounds, or $ 273 million _ Chemical operations jumped to 133 million pounds, or $ 239 million, from 51 million pounds, or $ 79 million, largely due to strong demand for petrochemical products _ Minerals earned 58 million pounds, or $ 104 million, up from 10 million pounds, or $ 15 million <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> ranks fourth after <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

May, the nation's seventh-largest retailer, said that in the quarter ended April 30, it had earnings of $ 62 million, down from $ 64 million during the first quarter of 1987. The company reported per-share earnings of 41 cents in both quarters. May said its first-quarter sales were $ 2.28 billion, down from $ 2.34 billion for the same period last year. The company fell victim _ as did many other major retailers _ to the sluggish consumer spending climate of the first quarter. `` For now, business continues to be slow, with most parts of sportswear and juniors performing poorly,'' May Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said. `` Expenses and inventories are being watched carefully.

 Estimates of the nation's economically recoverable but so-far-undiscovered offshore oil could be 27 percent lower than previous estimates, according to preliminary figures released today by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The department released new estimates for offshore oil and gas supplies and backup material for onshore estimates released in March. By coincidence, the new material was released shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it believed the nation had a 35-year supply of natural gas at prices under $ 3 per thousand cubic feet, and a $ 5 price would bring forth only another 10 years supply. Estimates of undiscovered onshore oil released by the Geological Survey in March were down about 40 percent from previous figures, in part because of drilling disappointments but also because lower prices keep explorers from even considering high-cost pools. Today's numbers were broken down by area, and department officials refused to supply totals, citing their desire to avoid giving any impression the figures were unchangeable. But simple addition showed that the mean estimate _ that estimate which there is a 50 percent chance of exceeding _ was 8.87 billion barrels of oil, down 27 percent, and 74 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, down 18 percent. Expressed in terms of equivalent energy content, the new estimates would be 22 percent below the old ones. The same estimates in 1984 were 12.2 billion barrels of oil and 90.5 trillion cubic feet of gas. The decline, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst who spoke on condition he not be identified, can be attributed to drilling disappointments, notably in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and lower prices. The new estimates assume oil costs $ 18 a barrel, about the current price. The old estimates assumed oil costs of about $ 30 a barrel. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said in announcing the new reserve estimates that `` natural gas has not taken its rightful place'' in the nation's energy supplies and the department was trying to allay public fears of short supplies left over from pipeline curtailments in the severe northeastern winters of 1976-77 and 1977-78. If price were no object, current technology could recover about 1,029 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study said. At $ 3 per thousand cubic feet or less, 583 trillion cubic feet could be produced. An increase in price to $ 5 would bring only an additional 174 trillion cubic feet. The nation uses about 17 trillion cubic feet of natural gas per year. The average wellhead price last year was $ 1.83, which the department's semi-independent <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> predicts will reach $ 4.02 in the year 2000.

<HEAD>Davis Bid for TV Producer That Agreed to Takeover by Warner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> renewed his bid for ailing television producer <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday, just two days after <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> agreed to become part of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who previously offered $ 17 per share for the maker of such hit TV series as `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and `` Knots Landing,'' notified the company he would pay $ 15 cash per share, or $ 679.5 <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> values the tentative agreement it made with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday at $ 1.18 billion. That agreement includes assumption of $ 550 million in <LOCATION> Lorimar </LOCATION> debt and financial penalties if <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> backs out and merges with a third party. Pending review of confidential financial information, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said in a letter released by <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, `` we are prepared to consider increasing our price in a negotiated transaction.'' A spokesman for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, an oil man and investor who formerly owned <ORGANIZATION> Twentieth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment. Lorimar officials declined immediate comment on the impact <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' offer might have on the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> transaction. That match was seen as a way to solve <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s cash problems and make <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> a leader in television production as well as its present strength in movies and music. The deal was conditional, but <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelson </PERSON> made it clear at the time he saw the tax-free stock-swap deal with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> as the ideal marriage. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' $ 15-per-share figure for Lorimar matches the minimum value placed on the stock swap that forms the basis of the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> deal. That merger, tentatively scheduled to close in September, would trade .415 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock for each of the 45.3 million outstanding shares of Lorimar common stock. In addition to the stock swap, valued by the companies at $ 630 million, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would assume about $ 550 million in <LOCATION> Lorimar </LOCATION> debt. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> is allowed to back out if <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s stock value does not bring <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> shareholders at least $ 15 per share, a figure <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> calculates would be met if <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price averages $ 36 a share. If <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> cancels, the agreement commits it to pay <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> $ 10 million. If <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> is acquired by a third party, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> has the right to buy 18.5 percent of the outstanding shares at $ 15 a share.

<HEAD>Crop Evaluators To Examine Wheat Fields In Seven States</HEAD>

 A team of evaluators will examine wheat fields in seven states next week to check on the condition of the crop as it approaches harvest. `` The wheat is starting to head out,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinton </PERSON>, a grain analyst for the AgriVisor marketing service in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>. `` It is in a very critical stage _ the reproductive stage.'' <PERSON> Quinton </PERSON> has organized the wheat evaluation tour, which will focus on the nation's key soft red winter wheat states of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> this week issued its first estimates of the season for wheat production across the country based on May 1 conditions. It said the harvest is expected to be up 4 percent for all winter varieties. `` We do feel it would be worthwhile to go out and get a mid-course correction,'' <PERSON> Quinton </PERSON> said Wednesday. He said soft red wheat production is projected to be 426 million bushels from this summer's harvest, up from 348 million bushels in 1987. `` This very likely is not so much a yield increase as an acreage increase,'' said <PERSON> Quinton </PERSON>, noting farmers planted 1.7 million more acres last fall than the previous year. The states in which evaluators will examine fields have nearly 7 million acres of soft red winter wheat out of a total of about 10.5 million in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quinton </PERSON> said. Evaluators will begin the tour Monday, covering several routes and stopping about every 15 to 20 miles to check fields. The team will include people from the grain trade, the milling industry, the government, producer groups and the news media. In each field, participants will check the soil moisture condition, the stage of development of the wheat, the size of the stand, and the potential number and size of grain heads. They also will look for any evidence of disease. <PERSON> Quinton </PERSON> said most of the soft red winter wheat seems to be in good condition. Most was planted in a timely fashion last fall, and cool, dry spring conditions have favored the development of much of the crop. Soft red wheat is milled to make fine flours that are used in things like cake, cookies and crackers. It is the hard wheat grown farther west that is used for breads.

 The stock market swung upward today, recovering some of Wednesday's losses. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 37.80 on Wednesday, rose 12.60 to 1,978.45 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 837 up, 571 down and 495 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 122.58 million shares with an hour to go. A big chunk of today's trading took place in a single stock _ <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, unchanged at 24 -LRB- on turnover of more than 29 million shares. Analysts said the activity stemmed from short-term strategies based on the company's impending quarterly dividend. At current levels Avon shares sport an annual yield of 8.3 percent. Otherwise, analysts said investors were doing a little tentative buying in stocks depressed by Wednesday's selloff, which came amid increasing worries about rising interest rates. Rates moved up a bit again today, however, on continuing talk that strength in the economy might increase inflationary pressures. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that retail sales fell 0.6 percent in April, but it also revised the figure for March to a 1.7 percent gain from a previously estimated rise of 0.8 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Norton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 | to 52 The issue was added to <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock composite index, prompting buying by index funds set up to track the performance of the 500.

 Soybean futures closed sharply lower Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as rainy weather forecasts persuaded traders to take profits. Grain futures also closed lower. A five-day rally that pushed soybean and soybean meal prices to new contract highs on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday ended abruptly Thursday as rain dampened parts of the Corn Belt and improved the growing conditions for newly planted crops.

<HEAD>Some Economists Question Big Scare About Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Inflation paranoia has gripped the financial markets, which only a few months back were preoccupied with the threat of a recession. But some economists say the specter of rising prices is highly exaggerated. These economists argue that unlike the 1970s, when price spirals became ingrained, the economy of the 1980s has been reshaped by fundamental changes that have restrained costs and wages, two key components of inflation. Moreover, their reasoning goes, the highly competitive global economy and higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> productivity provide compelling evidence that acute inflation will not revisit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the forseeable future. `` There's a very slow learning process in the markets,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekman </PERSON>, senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Claremont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a forecasting firm in <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that rejects the prevalent thinking about inflation fear. `` We've had inflation scares every year.'' Unfounded or not, this anxiety has helped wrench down stock and bond prices and raise long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> yields to the highest levels of 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been maneuvering to tighten credit as a preemptive step to thwart inflation, and on Wednesday banks responded by raising their prime lending rates. To some degree, economists say, inflation anxiety results from the stock market crash seven months ago. After the collapse the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> used a mix of confidence-building public statements and big injections of money into the banking system to quell fears that a recession loomed. Since then the economy has shown surprising strength, but the uncertainty raised by the crash has lingered. Many investors now say they fear a rapidly expanding economy, because it would mean higher wages, more demand for credit and too much money chasing too few goods. That translates into inflation. The economists who dispute that view argue that wages have not risen, despite the lowest unemployment in 14 years. On the contrary, wages have fallen in some areas relative to inflation, which last year totaled 4.4 percent and for the first three months of this year ran at an annual rate of 4.2 percent. `` Labor costs have remained meek and mild,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Belous </PERSON>, a labor economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a business-financed economic research group in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` If inflationary costs start getting imbedded in labor costs, then the ballgame's over, but I do n't think it's happening.'' The primary reason for this, <PERSON> Belous </PERSON> and others say, is that the labor market is radically different now. Many companies have restructured into smaller, leaner operations with non-union workers. Moreover, many Americans are employed in temporary and part-time jobs that offer relatively low wages, little job security and often no benefits. `` Management is now playing hardball with labor,'' <PERSON> Belous </PERSON> said. `` It ca n't just pass costs on to the consumer. Markets are deregulated, there's more competition. We're part of a global economy.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, economist at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, argues that inflation worriers are using outdated economic formulas for assuming that lower unemployment translates into rising prices. On the contrary, he said, higher employment means higher production, which equals lower prices. `` This is logical when you think about it. If you produce more of something, each unit tends to cost less. Rapidly growing economies tend to have declining cost curves,'' <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON> said. `` Just because the unemployment rate is coming down does n't translate into inflation. So I'm arguing the analysis is dead wrong.'' Asked why inflation paranoia has afflicted the markets, <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON> said: `` I think the experience of the late 1970s was very searing. Clearly we do n't want to repeat that.'' Some economists argue that sharply higher factory utilization rates portend inflation because they imply supply will not keep up with demand, thereby pressuring prices up. But others say that is also outdated thinking. `` The idea that a lot of industries are close to capacity is just a measure of their improved efficiency,'' said <PERSON> Hekman </PERSON>. `` These people are not about to let inflation get away from them.''

<TEXT>
 Finance and economics ministers from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> meet Friday and Saturday to discuss an idea which some key observers say may be an impossible dream: creation of a single EEC currency. `` I doubt that the governments are prepared to make such a far-reaching decision,'' <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters last week. The community's finance and economics ministers as well as central bank presidents from the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> nations are to hold a closed-door session in the Baltic Seas coastal resort town of <LOCATION> Travemuende </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Luebeck </LOCATION>. Several key West European leaders, including West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, have proposed creating a common EEC currency as well as a central <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> bank to manage it. In February, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> urged the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> to appoint a team of experts to come up with a definite plan. The proposals for a common currency are expected to be a major topic of discussion at the Travemuende meeting, according to finance ministry officials here. Other possible means of strengthening the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s exchange-rate system, the European Monetary System, are also expected to be topics at the meeting. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, French Finance Minister <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Balladur </PERSON> and others say a common EEC currency would strengthen West European unity and help smooth the way for the creation of a barrier-free internal market throughout <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 1992. But skeptics of the plan, including <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON>, say they do n't think <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> governments are ready to take steps that could lead to denting their currency autonomy. <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> and others have pointed out that many EEC nations including <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are not even full members of the European Monetary System. `` At a time that most of the EEC countries are not even able to fulfill their obligations to this very limited system, it's a little premature to talk about something new,'' <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> said. Only <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> are full members of the monetary system, which works to stabilize currency exchange rates within the EEC. <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> has also repeatedly warned that any steps towards creating a central European Bank could infringe upon the constitutional independence of the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it set up a committee of three independent directors to hold talks with its two suitors, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> maintained it had no intention of sweetening its hostile $ 1.08 billion bid, and was not holding any negotiations with <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>. `` We have always said any time <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> will come to the table with substantive negotiations we would listen. But we're not prepared to talk to them in an auction environment,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> disclosed the special committee in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. The company said that while the directors were authorized to meet directly with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Banca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Commerciale </LOCATION>, `` there can be no assurances that these discussions will result in any improvement in either.'' <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s announcement came nearly a week after its annual meeting, in which shareholders voted between a slate of 16 incumbent directors that back a restructuring and friendly merger with <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> and nominees from rival Bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The voting results are not expected to be released until a reconvened meeting May 24, although both sides are claiming victory. Banking analysts generally have given <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> an edge in the proxy battle, mostly because it already has secured the necessary regulatory approvals. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second largest bank which is controlled by the government agency Instituto per la <ORGANIZATION> Recostruzione </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industriale </ORGANIZATION>, has just begun the lengthy regulatory review process. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which owns a nearly 5 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, is offering $ 15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its stock for each of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s common shares. The offer, which is scheduled to expire May 13, is valued at about $ 63 a share or $ 1.08 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> is offering $ 75 a share for 9.5 million Irving shares, or about 51 percent, valued at $ 707 million. In addition, it said it would pay shareholders interest on the purchase price from May 31 until the deal closes.

 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> acted Thursday to protect itself from the pound's recent surge by contracting some of its <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> jetliner work to <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The $ 700 million agreement calls for <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> to manufacture wing parts at its factory in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. British Aerospace said the contract was denominated in dollars, which would reduce its risks from further rises in the pound making its Airbus work too costly Most orders for civilian aircraft around the world are denominated in dollars, and the leading aircraft builder, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION>'s work on wing parts for 600 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> A330 and A340 airliners accounts for about 15 percent of the total <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> work for which British Aerospace is responsible, the company said. British Aerospace is a partner in the four-nation <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> consortium, which also includes aircraft manufacturers from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> will work as a `` risk sharing subcontractor'' to British Aerospace, receiving the total amount specified in the contract only if the full 600 aircraft are ordered from Airbus. And <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> will meet all the start-up costs itself for the manufacture of the wing parts, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It means that <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> has to believe in the product as much as we do,'' said <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> currently has commitments from customers to buy 145 of the new aircraft, with the A340 scheduled to enter service in May 1992 and the A330 in September 1992. British Aerospace said it was negotiating several other dollar-denominated contracts to further reduce its currency exposure. British Aerospace announced in March that it had a pre-tax loss of 159 million pounds last year after making a 320 million pound provision for expected future losses on civilian aircraft production. A pound is now worth about $ 1.84.

 Retail sales fell 0.6 percent in April, the first setback in six months, with the decline blamed on an early Easter, bad weather and a bigger federal tax bite for some people. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said consumers spent a seasonally adjusted $ 131.6 billion at retail stores last month, a drop of $ 815 million from the revised March figure. Sales had not fallen since a 0.8 percent setback last October, but economists said they were not particularly concerned by the weakness, especially since sales in March were revised upward to show an increase of 1.7 percent. That was the fastest sales advance since last August and almost twice the originally estiated 0.8 percent gain for the month. Both the big jump in March sales and the April decline were blamed on the fact that Easter occurred on April 3 this year, meaning that consumers did their spring shopping in March, siphoning off sales that would normally have occurred last month. `` The April retail sales figure is very misleading because of Easter. Consumer spending is still holding up well,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said other factors that played a role in the April decline were unseasonably cold weather in some parts of the country that discouraged sales of such items as garden equipment and higher tax bills some Americans faced at filing time this year They noted in particular that sales at restaurants were down 1.6 percent, while sales at furniture stores were off 0.2 percent. `` Some people did get shocked by the new tax law. They may have filled out their tax forms and decided they could n't afford to eat out for the rest of the month,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Megan </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm, said he was not concerned by the April sales dip because with unemployment now at a 14-year low of 5.4 percent, consumers are confident about the future `` With employment and incomes still growing, we expect consumers will keep spending,'' he said. Total economic activity, as measured by the gross national product, rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first three months of the year, far better than the recession some people were predicting immediately after the October stock market collapse. However, the surprisingly strong growth has raised inflation concerns. Many economists believe the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has moved in recent days to tighten up on interest rates as a way to dampen demand and keep inflation under control. Major banks on Wednesday boosted their prime lending rate one-half percentage point to 9 percent, reflecting the tighter credit conditions. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the weak report on retail sales `` may serve to dampen inflationary expectations.'' The April retail sales report showed that car sales declined 1 percent during the month, the first drop since last November. Analysts said this reflected the phaseout of various sales incentive programs that had lured consumers into showrooms in earlier months. Without the weakness in car sales, total retail sales would have been a slightly lower 0.5 percent in April. Sales at hardware and building supply stores were up 1 percent. Analysts attributing some of this strength to a boom in home remodeling as more homeowners choose to renovate rather than move to bigger houses. Sales of non-durable goods dropped 0.6 percent overall. Within the category, sales at department stores dropped 0.5 percent, erasing part of the 2.1 percent jump in March. Both months were influenced by the early Easter. Sales at grocery stores fell 0.3 percent in April, while sales at gasoline stations were off 1.3 percent and sales at restaurants dropped 1.6 percent. Sales of all durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, dropped 0.6 percent.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has tentatively agreed to authorize the president to negotiate a higher <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> content for automobiles coming under the proposed U.S.-Canada free-trade agreement, the staff of Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., said Thursday The proposed treaty requires that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or Canadian parts, components and labor account for half the content of cars moving duty-free across the border. Critics of the treaty, <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> among them, have said that level is too low. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s proposal would authorize the president to negotiate a higher domestic-content rule with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, in the hope of raising it to 60 percent. If negotiations succeed, the president would be able to begin the higher requirement through a proclamation, rather than returning to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for consent, <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s staff said. Under the terms of the free-trade negotiations, both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must accept or reject the treaty as is, without amendment. However, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the power to tie its acceptance of the treaty to the fulfillment of certain conditions, or to pass other legislation authorizing the president to try to renegotiate parts of the agreement. `` My goal has been to improve the implementing language so that the agreement is better,'' <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said. `` We are making some significant progress.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has not completed its work on the bill. The 50 percent North American content requirement has been criticized by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and parts suppliers. A level that low would allow manufacturers to import engines, transmissions and other major components. Another heavily criticized provision would allow <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to retain until 1996 agreements giving preferential duty treatment to manufacturers outside <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who have Canadian production. Extending the preferential treatment will allow Canadian suppliers and Japanese manufacturers to forge agreements that will shut out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suppliers from part of the market, critics have said.

 The stock market struggled to a small gain Thursday in a sluggish bid to rebound from Wednesday's broad decline. Trading was quiet. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 37.80 on Wednesday, recovered 2.15 points to 1,968.00. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed trading, with 796 up, 637 down and 528 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 143.88 million shares, down from 176.72 million in the previous session. Nationwide, volume in NYSE-listed issues totaled 164.82 million shares. A big chunk of the day's trading took place in a single stock _ <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, down -LRB- at 24 on turnover of more than 29.8 million shares. Analysts said the activity stemmed from short-term strategies based on the company's impending quarterly dividend. At recent levels Avon shares sport an annual yield of 8.3 percent. Otherwise, analysts said investors were doing a little tentative buying in stocks depressed by Wednesday's selloff, which came amid increasing worries about rising interest rates. Rates were mixed in the credit markets Thursday as the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> completed a three-day auction of $ 26 billion in bonds and notes. Brokers said traders remained concerned that persistent strength in the economy would lead to upward pressure on interest rates and inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that retail sales fell 0.6 percent in April, but it also revised the figure for March to a 1.7 percent gain from a previously estimated rise of 0.8 percent. The government's monthly report on the producer price index is due out Friday. Advance estimates on Wall Street call for an increase of about 0.4 percent in the index for April, after a 0.6 percent rise the month before. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> rose -LCB- to 47 \; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> \ to 39; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to 44, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> -LCB- to 27 -RRB- But <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 108 -RCB-. Dow Chemical picked up -RRB- to 81. The company said it expects its earnings this year to top the record set in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Norton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 | to 52 The issue was added to <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock composite index, prompting buying by index funds set up to track the performance of the 500. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 5.64 billion, or 0.22 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained .30 to 143.78. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose .39 to 294.17, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up .54 at 253.85 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added .99 to 370.23.

<HEAD>GAO Report Raps Big Banks on Foreign Debt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks are undercapitalized and underregulated and have failed to write down approximately $ 28 billion in uncollectable foreign loans, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said in a report released Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, found fault with federal regulators such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for creating a lenient classification system for developing country debt. Using today's secondary market as a guidepost, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> calculated that the average Third World loan is worth 54 percent of its stated value. Under this criteria, the report estimated that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks have reserved $ 21.1 billion of foreign loans when a more realistic figure should be $ 49 billion. In contrast, the criteria regulators developed only required $ 2.3 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank write-downs of uncollectable loans, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, who asked for the report, said, `` In this ` audit of the auditors,' it can be inferred that the record first-quarter profits recently announced for banks engaged in overseas lending are a shibboleth and that these institutions should write off this year loans of a greater magnitude than they did last year. `` Bank earnings are only as sound as their loan portfolios and those portfolios, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> finds, are overvalued,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank loans to developing countries decreased from $ 139.7 billion in June 1982 to $ 107.6 billion in December 1987, while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank capital increased from $ 66.2 billion in June 1982 to $ 129.2 billion in December 1987. As a result, from June 1982 to December 1987 bank loans owed by developing countries decreased from 211 percent of bank capital to 83 percent. During this time, developing country loans owed to the nine largest money center banks decreased from 323 percent of these banks' capital to 139 percent. `` While these figures reflect a prudential improvement in circumstances for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks, developing country loans are still large compared with bank capital and are disproportionately concentrated in a small number of money center institutions,'' said <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, a ranking Republican on the House Banking, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and its international finance, trade and monetary policy subcommittee.

<TEXT>
 The dollar finished slightly lower against most other currencies Thursday in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after rising marginally in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and money brokers said there was little news to influence trading. Gold prices rose in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after falling in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. As of 4 p.m. EDT, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 450.90 a troy ounce, up from $ 448.80 late Wednesday. `` It was another dull day in the currency market,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Broyd </PERSON>, vice president of foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Traders said the boost the dollar got Wednesday from rising interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was partly eroded by an assumption that other nations also would raise their rates, negating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> impact. Higher interest rates make a currency more attractive to foreign investors. Others said remarks by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> governor <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>, who vaguely indicated the central bank may not necessarily tighten credit further, had little impact on the dollar. But some money market economists said they saw long-term weakness in the dollar because of the continually high trade and budget deficits and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s apparent reluctance to nudge interest rates up too much. `` From an interest rate point of view, the foreign exchange market assumes the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is constraied on how high interest rates can go,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Money </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> forecasting firm. `` You have the mere mention of higher interest rates and the bond and stock markets go into the tank pretty quick.'' The dollar rose to 124.39 Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, vs. 124.24 yen Wednesday. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the dollar was quoted at 124.47 yen. By the time trading concluded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar was quoted at 124.53 yen, slightly higher than the 124.47 yen quoted late Wednesday. The British pound fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 1.8823 from $ 1.8870 late Wednesday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound fetched $ 1.8833, higher than its $ 1.8815 value late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.6816 West German marks, down from 1.6827; 1.3987 Swiss francs, down from 1.3995; 1.2300 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2314; 5.7005 French francs, down from 5.7037; and 1,251.00 Italian lire, down from 1,251.50. Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6813 marks, up from 1.6773; 1.3987 Swiss francs, up from 1.3935; 5.7020 French francs, up from 5.6912; 1.8850 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8830; 1,250.50 Italian lire, up from 1,249.50; and 1.2298 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2315. Gold bullion prices rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 451.50 a troy ounce, vs. $ 449.30 Wednesday. <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> markets were closed for the Ascension Day holiday.

<HEAD>Soybean Rally Stalls, Prices Plunge As Rain Falls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A five-day rally that pushed soybean futures prices to four-year highs ended Thursday as rainy weather forecasts persuaded traders to take profits. Grain futures also closed lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. On other markets, pork futures continued to climb; cattle futures were mostly higher; precious metals posted slight gains; energy futures slipped a bit; and stock-index futures edged higher. Soybean futures prices had climbed more than 32 cents a bushel _ a gain of nearly 5 percent _ in the past week and set new contract highs on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. But the rally stalled Thursday as rain dampened parts of the <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION>, improving the growing conditions for newly planted crops. Weather forecasters predicted precipitation all the way into next week, prompting traders to offset their long positions and take profits, analysts said. `` After three straight days of new contract highs in the beans and meal, any market needs a pause to catch its breath,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It was an orderly correction,'' he said. `` It was n't anything unusual or out of the ordinary.'' Buying interest dried up in the soybean meal market on a lack of orders for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where most businesses were closed for a four-day holiday, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` They were providing big support yesterday,'' he said of the Europeans. `` Essentially what we had Wednesday was a condensing of three days of potential activity into one day.'' Analyst <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> of G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, also noted fairly heavy notices of intent to deliver corn and soybeans against the May contracts, an indication of adequate near-term supplies. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 4 cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.01 \ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.96 a bushel; oats were 2 \ cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.55 \ a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 8 cents lower with May at $ 7.07 Strong cash hog markets helped boost pork futures for a second day on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` The cash market is phenomenal,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The daily average price in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> two weeks ago was 40.93 cents -LRB- a pound -RRB-. Yesterday it was 46.23 cents. That's such a huge increase in a couple of weeks that you've got everyone convinced that it's going to keep going.'' A reduction in the number of hogs coming to market supported notions that the market has entered its seasonal downturn in supplies, he said. Most cattle futures also advanced on strong cash markets and indications of strong retail demand for beef, <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> said. Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .13 cent higher with June at 73.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent to .88 cent higher with May at 80.40 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .45 cent higher with June at 53.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .92 cent to 1.65 cents higher with May at 54.60 cents a pound. Gold and silver futures prices rose in reaction to the government's upward revision of its March retail sales figure, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> revised the March figure to show a 1.7 percent increase, the biggest advance since August and a much stronger gain than the originally reported 0.8 percent. `` That showed the economy continues to do well,'' which in turn suggests an increase in inflation, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold settled $ 1.90 to $ 2.20 higher with June at $ 453.30 a troy ounce; silver was 1.9 cents to 2.8 cents higher with May at $ 6.574 a troy ounce. Most energy futures prices dipped lower in dull, featureless trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with June at $ 17.48 a barrel; heating oil was .07 cent to .27 cent lower with June at 47.23 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was unchanged to .33 cent lower with June at 51.92 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures edged higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .40 point higher at 253.80.

 Two broad measures of the nation's money supply rose in late April and early May while a narrower measure fell, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose $ 1 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 2,997 billion in the week ended May 2 from $ 2,996 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased $ 5 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,768 billion from $ 3,763 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell $ 1.5 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 776.4 billion from a revised $ 777.9 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds.

<HEAD>Skilled Trades Workers Reject Chrysler Pact; Leaders to Meet in
Chicago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> skilled trades workers have rejected a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> contract ratified by other union members, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday. The rejection does not change the overall ratification, but could lead to new negotiations solely on skilled trades issues such as apprenticeships, according to union officials. The union scheduled a meeting Friday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to review the matter with its <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> skilled trades officials, who represent more than 10,500 of the No. 3 automaker's <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> members. The two-year contract, covering 66,000 hourly and salaried workers in 15 states, was ratified Wednesday by 54 percent of those voting. Skilled trades _ such as machine tool makers _ and salaried workers have additional, separate contracts covering issues unique to them. The two groups vote as one on whether to ratify or reject both contracts, which were approved by the salaried workers. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> said he had no figures on the skilled trades rejection or the salaried approval of the contract. There is at least one skilled trades delegate for each of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s nearly 50 <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> local unions. If the skilled trades rejection was based on issues contained in the main contract, such as economics, neither new negotiations nor a new skilled trades vote would occur, union sources said. Part of the purpose of Friday's meeting is to determine whether or not the rejection was based on issues unique to the skilled trades.

<BYLINE>Attorney Says Navistar Engaged In Sham Deal To Sell Off Wisconsin
Steel^

 <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sold off its money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary to avoid paying multimillion dollar pension benefits to workers, the government's pension insurance agency contended Thursday as trial began in its suit against <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> asked a federal judge to award it $ 140 million from <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> to cover the unpaid benefits plus interest. The long-awaited trial is considered an important test case to determine whether _ and to what extent _ a company can be forced to honor pension-plan obligations to workers. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> faces two lawsuits resulting from the ill-fated 1977 sale of <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> engineering company with no previous steel-making experience. The South Side <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> steel mill went bankrupt eight years ago, putting 3,500 employees out of work and leaving the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> with the tab for unpaid benefits. In an interview before presenting opening trial arguments Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kempf </PERSON> said the company welcomed its day in court. `` <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> has wanted for a long time to vindicate itself in this case and with this trial it will do so,'' <PERSON> Kempf </PERSON> said. In his two-hour opening statement before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bittman </PERSON> said company officials ignored recommendations from investment bankers that the sale was financially questionable because <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION> lacked the experience and funds to turn the steel company around. Other steel companies showed no interest in buying <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Steel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bittman </PERSON> said. He said company officials were aware at the time the deal might lead to lawsuits if the steel company went bankrupt, but went ahead with the sale to <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION> in order to avoid $ 167 million in losses it faced by liquidating <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Steel. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> sold <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Steel to a buyer that they knew did not have the experience or the financial wherewithal to run the steel division in an economic way,'' <PERSON> Bittman </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday. `` The reason they did it, was because the other alternative of liquidating the company would cost them too much money, even though they recognized that bankruptcy would be inevitable,'' <PERSON> Bittman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> denies duping <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION> into buying the steel company as part of a conspiracy to rid itself of the pension liabilities. It maintains <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Steel went bankrupt due to a delay in promised government-backed financing for modernization, a strike against <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>, and deterioration in market and economic conditions. Also Thursday, the judge in the non-jury trial heard opening arguments from attorneys for <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Steel creditors _ including an <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION> unit, the <ORGANIZATION> EDC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ who have filed a separate second lawsuit seeking triple damages of nearly $ 475 million from <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit alleges fraud and racketeering in the 1977 sale of the steel company. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in 1977 lent <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION> $ 50 million to finance the $ 65 million acquisition of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Steel. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> has already reached a $ 14.8 million out-of-court settlement with 2,700 former employees of the steel company. The government and workers filed lawsuits against <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> in 1981. <ORGANIZATION> EDC </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Kempf </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Bittman </PERSON>'s argument that the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Steel transaction lacked a reasonable chance of success. He said the reason it did not succeed was `` because of unforeseen factors that happened'' three years after the sale. The case adjourned late Thursday until Monday.

<HEAD>Continental Airlines Frequent Fliers To Be Credited Millions Of
Miles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has entered into an agreement with <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> officials under which the airline will credit millions of miles to members of its airline's frequent flier club, Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> said that as recently as May 3 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> advertised minimum credits of at least 1,000 miles per flight segment while it had been making minimum entries of only 750 miles since Jan. 1. Members of frequent flier clubs accumulate mileage credits that can be used for free or reduced fare airplane tickets. Besides the mileage credit discrepancy, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> advertised that members of its `` OnePass'' club could receive frequent flier award travel to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, but the airline did not make such trips available, <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> charged. <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> said the brochures and in-flight magazine advertisements were deceptive. He said the company attempted to save millions of dollars worth of award travel tickets nationwide. In the agreement it signed with <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>'s office, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> denied it violated <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> consumer protection laws, although it agreed to pay $ 20,000 in costs and investigation fees. The Houston-based airline said that when it announced its triple mileage program in a Jan. 21 letter to OnePass members, it clearly stated the mileage minimum being tripled was 750 miles. The company also said a March 1988 brochure used the 750-mile figure. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said in the agreement it depicted <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> as a frequent flier award destination because members wishing to go there could earn credits to make that trip by flying on sister airline Air <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>. The airline agreed to credit OnePass members at the 1,000-mile rate retroactively and keep the 1,000-mile rate in effect through July. It also agreed to withdraw any remaining advertisements and brochures using the 1,000-mile figure. The airline said it would add <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> as an award travel destination through Dec. 31. <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> estimated there are more than 2 million active OnePass members. During the first 16 weeks of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> enrolled an average of more than 45,000 members a week, he said.

 A substantial number of workers at a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> defense plant here will be laid off because of a drop in orders from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the company announced Thursday. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, refused to say exactly how many workers would be laid off or when. However, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> officials informed the state it would lay off about 900 workers over the next 18 months because of a decrease in defense-related orders, according to a state economic affairs official. The first phase of the layoffs is scheduled for July, according to the official, who asked not to be identified. The unexpected announcement by the company came only three months after <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> promised stable employment at its <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> businesses this year. The company had laid off 1,000 workers last year when it closed its transformer plant. The ordnance division, which employs 4,700 people, makes guidance systems for Trident submarine-launched nuclear missiles, components of the <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> fighting machine, which carries infantrymen, various high-speed guns and other military products. `` The market we serve we thought, up to a year ago, to be at least in a sustaining basis and somewhat of a growth basis,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said at a news conference. He blamed the sudden turnaround on government cutbacks in ordnance contracts. `` As pressure gets tough on defense budgets, government customers have to make difficult decisions,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. He said a government contract the company recently lost to <ORGANIZATION> Northrup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> had little to do with the layoffs. `` We had really planned our business based on not winning that contract because there was so much controvery over whether the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> wished to use our technology,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. `` Certainly if that contract had come, I would not have had to take as severe an action as we're going to have to take without it.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> also said a decrease in orders would mean a slowdown in <LOCATION> Bradley </LOCATION> fighting machine production, from 550 yearly to about 350. He said he told the company's 500 management employees Thursday morning about the impending layoffs. Neither managers nor union officials could be immediately reached for comment. GE now employs about 6,700 people in the ordnance and plastics plants in the city, the number it had employeed in 1983, before the company began expanding the ordnance systems division with 1,400 new employees by late 1986. Workers at the company were dealt a major blow in the fall of 1986 when <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> announced it would close its transformer division in <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>. GE announced in August 1987 it was reorganizing the ordnance division to eliminate the engineering and manufacturing department and replace it with a Division Effectiveness Operation to improve efficiency. `` The steps we are taking are usually taken by businesses in trouble and we are not in trouble,'' division Vice President <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Boraski </PERSON> said at the time.
